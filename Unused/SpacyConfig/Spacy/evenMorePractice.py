#working with word vectors.
# Word vectors are matrixes of words that show similarity or rellation between words
# for example griffindor might be similar to hufflepuff
# the first thing that we need is training data to be able to create these word vectors
# to do this you need a lot of text separated by sentence into lists and then again
# by words so it will look like [["Hello", " I", "am", "cool"], ["He", " is ", " not", "cool"]]
#and also a list of stop words or words that are used too commonly in the english language and will pollute the vectors
#you can find a list of these online
