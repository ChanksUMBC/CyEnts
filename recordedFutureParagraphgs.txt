                Why Monitoring the Dark Web is Essential for Third-Party Risk Management                            
:\/:
The dark web is often portrayed as vast, mysterious, and out of reach for companies without specialized expertise. In reality, the dark web is one of the 
:\/:
 in the cybersecurity industry today. However, if you cut through the noise, you’ll find that the dark web is an enormously valuable source of information for third-party risk management professionals. 
:\/:
The dark web is a subset of the Internet. It’s accessible via special software such as Tor that allows users and website operators to remain anonymous or untraceable. Websites on the dark web operate in their own unique environment, separated from surface sites such as Amazon, eBay, or Youtube. Cybercriminals use the dark web to coordinate and execute cyber attacks, as well as to sell stolen data and even exploits into companies. 
:\/:
However, not all parts of the dark web are equal. Many portions are accessible to anyone willing to download Tor. The information you find in these relatively easy-to-access parts of the dark web are often of limited value. Other parts of the dark web are invite-only, requiring special access that requires years of effort developing personas accepted among the cybercriminal community. This closed part of the dark web is where one more often can find information of high value. These closed channels, also known as the criminal underground, can extend beyond the proper dark web and into private criminal forums hosted on Telegram, Discord, and other places.
:\/:
Third-party risk management teams are tasked with assessing risk across the entire full vendor lifecycle, from vendor selection to relationship termination. When it comes to assessing cybersecurity risk, one of the most important questions to understand is “has my vendor recently experienced a cyber attack or breach?”
:\/:
Unfortunately, current methods to assess this information – questionnaires, onsite audits, and  penetration testing – can’t fully answer this question.
:\/:
The dark web provides a unique view into that you cannot get elsewhere, helping identify several high-risk factors that a vendor has, or is about to breached:  
:\/:
Ransomware operators use extortion sites to threaten their victims into paying ransoms, under threat of publicly releasing stolen data. While the practice is deplorable, these dark web sites provide an early warning signal that one of your third-parties has been struck by ransomware. In some cases you can even use the sites to verify if any of your data was leaked via your third-party. 
:\/:
Sensitive data including IP, PII, and HIPAA information frequently find their way to the dark web, likely indicating a breach of a third-party.
:\/:
Company email addresses and passwords are often for sale on the dark web. Leaked credentials indicate a potential attack coming soon.
:\/:
Some threat actors use the dark web to sell direct access to a company through a vulnerability. By identifying the sale of these vulnerabilities, you can proactively stop future breaches of your third parties. 
:\/:
Threat actors are known to discuss their recent attacks and upcoming plans on underground channels. Keeping a close eye on mentions of your third parties can help you stay in front of breaches and upcoming cyber attacks. 
:\/:
The dark web is too widespread and complex for any single individual to successfully monitor. Third-party intelligence from Recorded Future does that work for you, by automatically collecting and analyzing posts from the dark to deliver high-confidence indicators of risk including ransomware extortion, leaked credentials, and high-volumes of attention on high-tier forums.
:\/:
Third-party risk professionals use third-party intelligence to stay on top of their vendors, allowing them to proactively identify and mitigate risk as it surfaces.

                How Contextualized Intelligence Maximizes Security Outcomes in SecOps Tools                            
:\/:
As the attack surface grows,  it’s difficult for security teams to maintain a comprehensive, real-time view of the threats at an operational level. With too little time and not enough information, analysts struggle to determine which alerts represent a critical incident and which may just be a redundancy or a false positive — all while true positives may be slipping through the cracks.
:\/:
To effectively respond to the multitude of alerts generated each day, security operations teams need a way to prioritize which alerts to focus on so they can maximize their efforts and mitigate risks. The 
:\/:
 create clarity in decision making by adding rich context within an organization’s existing SecOps tools to optimize threat detection and response workflows, ultimately reducing risk for the organization.
:\/:
When internal alerts come from non contextual threat feeds and disparate systems, they lack the vital information needed for confident, quick threat remediation. Analysts spend valuable cycles manually researching IOCs, only to find incomplete pieces of what they need. With high-confidence, actionable intelligence tailored to SecOps use cases, analysts can spend more time proactively improving the security posture of their organization.
:\/:
Recorded Future provides automated, verified intelligence that connects the dots between indicators at scale, providing SecOps analysts with a more complete view of risk to their organization. With

:\/:
Traditional methods to manage third-party risk can’t keep up. Governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) teams, as well as their security counterparts, continue to struggle to accurately assess risk given the continually shifting circumstances surrounding who they do business with. And for many, maintaining on-going visibility into their vendors’ constantly changing risk profile is a difficult or impossible task.
:\/:
GRC and security teams need a proactive approach to identify, manage, and mitigate third-party risk, and intelligence is here to help. Intelligence acts as a source of truth on key risk indicators, eliminating the guesswork associated with assessing vendor risk. It reduces the time you spend on vendor risk assessments by 50%, and greatly enhances the quality of those assessments.
:\/:
Most importantly, intelligence gives you the confidence and context you need to take control of third-party risk. There’s no need for panicked responses to breaking news on third-party breaches. Intelligence enables you to stay in front of a constantly changing risk landscape.
:\/:
 uses the power of the world’s largest commercial collection platform to provide the most complete picture of cyber risk. By automatically collecting, aggregating, and analyzing information from over one million distinct sources, Recorded Future is able to provide real-time visibility into the risks of your third parties. Leveraging our proprietary data sourcing and unique background as an intelligence provider, we provide unprecedented insight into a wide range of security risks to allow you to instantly assess risk including:
:\/:
 — Cyber attacks and security breach disclosures are essential risk indicators to monitor third parties for. Our threat research team Insikt Group often adds their own analysis to major security incidents, giving you fast insight into what happened, why it matters, and what you can do about it
:\/:
 — Infrastructure abuse such as communication with C2 servers, hosted TOR notes, and malware detections all indicate that a company is highly vulnerable to attack.
:\/:
 — Cybercriminals often use the dark web and other underground channels to discuss cyber attacks involving your third parties. Ransomware extortion sites, for example, are a high-risk indicator that your third party was likely struck by ransomware. However, not all dark web sites are equal. Recorded Future is the only third-party intelligence provider granting access to invite-only, high-tier dark web forums.
:\/:
 — Exposed data from business accounts used by employees on dark web and paste sites leave third-parties exposed to credential stuffing attacks and account impersonation. Our massive collection of leaked credentials and data dumps is constantly growing.
:\/:
For a long time, threat intelligence has held a reputation as being complex and inaccessible to those without a background in it. In fact, ten years ago, the notion of a GRC team actively consuming threat intelligence would have been laughable.
:\/:
Recorded Future’s Third-Party Intelligence module is specifically created for the GRC team, providing key risk indicators that help to assess, monitor, and mitigate risk. Transparent remediation details are provided with all findings, giving GRC teams the leverage they need to work with their third-parties to mitigate risk.
:\/:
, making it simple to incorporate intelligence directly within existing business practices. If your organization uses NIST as the basis of vendor risk assessments, you can easily map intelligence directly to your questionnaire, allowing you to quickly validate submissions.
:\/:
GRC teams and security teams both want to protect the business. However, they often use different terminology, frameworks, and technologies to do their jobs, creating misalignment and miscommunication when the teams need to work together. Modular intelligence offerings from Recorded Future work as your middleman, providing a common language and platform to understand, communicate, and action risk across teams.

But for SOAR solutions to work effectively, they require a series of defined playbooks designed to automate repeatable security workflows — and these playbooks are only as smart and effective as the data used to construct them.
:\/:
IBM Security SOAR helps security teams respond to cyber threats with confidence, automate with intelligence, and collaborate with consistency. It captures and codifies established incident response processes into dynamic playbooks to guide and empower security analysts with knowledge to resolve incidents.

:\/:
The Security Intelligence Handbook, Third Edition: How to Disrupt Adversaries and Reduce Risk With Security Intelligence
:\/:
.” In this excerpt, which has been edited and condensed, see how a large HR solutions provider defeated typosquatting with a proactive approach to digital brand protection: 
:\/:
Brand protection involves safeguarding an organization’s image, reputation, and customers from attacks that primarily never touch its network or systems. These threats include: 
:\/:
Fake websites and social media accounts used to impersonate the organization or its employees for fraud and phishing attacks
:\/:
Malicious content and false information about the organization and its products posted on websites and social media platforms
:\/:
Most of these threats are posed by financially motivated criminals, but they may also involve hacktivists, dissatisfied customers, competitors, and careless or disgruntled employees who reveal information online. 
:\/:
To truly protect your brand, you need to be concerned about threats that leverage it to harm or influence your customers. Customers who are lured into a scam or fraud from an imitation of your website may hold your organization responsible. Those who buy a low-quality, counterfeit version of your product from an online marketplace may lose trust in your brand. Those who think one of your executives has published offensive content on the web may boycott your products — even if it wasn’t your executive who posted it. Pleading “it wasn’t our fault” won’t restore their trust or your reputation in any of these scenarios. 
:\/:
Most of the activities we have been discussing in this handbook involve creating intelligence about attackers and their tools. Brand intelligence includes some of that, as well, but the emphasis is instead on detecting your organization’s name and brand everywhere they occur across the internet. 
:\/:
You need to be rigorous about listing and searching for mentions of all your brand and product names, and keywords that are associated with them. These include the names of:
:\/:
It also includes trademarks, service marks, and advertising slogans that appear on your organization’s authorized websites, since these are frequently used on phony websites. 
:\/:
Knowing what to look for empowers you to find evidence of brand impersonation and abuse in places many organizations never search. For example, a brand intelligence solution enables you to: 
:\/:
Search domain registries to find domain names that include your organization or product name, or variations of them
:\/:
Monitor social media to alert you to hashtags that include your organization or product name, or variations of them
:\/:
Scan social media to detect accounts that claim to belong to your organization, your executives, or your employees
:\/:
Typosquatting involves manipulating the characters in an organization’s domain name into nearly identical domains. For instance, threat actors targeting example.com might create a typosquat URL of exanple.com. Attackers often register thousands of domains differing by a single character from their target organizations’ URLs. They do this for reasons ranging from suspicious to fully malicious. 
:\/:
Rogue websites using these modified domain names are built to look like legitimate websites. The rogue domains and websites are often used in spear-phishing campaigns against employees or customers, watering-hole attacks, and drive-by download attacks. 
:\/:
Being alerted to newly registered phishing and typosquatting domains in real time is the best way to narrow the window of opportunity for threat actors to impersonate your brand and defraud unsuspecting users. Once the malicious infrastructure is identified, you’re able to employ a takedown service to nullify the threat. 
:\/:
By monitoring the web — including private forums on the dark web — brand intelligence solutions enable you to uncover evidence of data breaches within your organization and partner ecosystem. You may find: 
:\/:
It’s often possible to narrow down the source of a leak by looking at exactly what information and artifacts are found on the web, where they are found, and what else is found in the same place. For example, if you find product designs or software code on a dark web site and recognize that they were shared with only a few suppliers, you would know to investigate the security controls of those suppliers as part of your third-party risk management program. If your organization’s name was mentioned on a hacker’s forum whose members are known to attack certain applications, you could increase protection of the targeted applications by patching the systems they run on, monitoring them more closely, and adding security controls. 
:\/:
Threat actors make money from many types of compromised personal information and corporate intellectual property. Examples of compromised data for sale on the dark web include medical records, cloned and compromised gift cards, and stolen credentials to “pay for” services like Netflix and Uber, and items charged via PayPal, as illustrated in Figure 10-1. 
:\/:
A high percentage of hacking-related breaches leverage stolen or weak passwords. Threat actors regularly upload massive caches of usernames and passwords to paste sites and the dark web, or make them available for sale on underground marketplaces. These data dumps may include corporate email addresses and passwords, as well as login details for other sites. 
:\/:
Monitoring external sources for this type of intelligence will dramatically increase your visibility — not just into leaked credentials, but also into potential breaches of corporate data and proprietary code. 
:\/:
Of course, mitigating digital risk to your brand is not simply a matter of stumbling across one typosquatting domain or some isolated piece of stolen data. Somebody, or something, has to do the broader work of collecting masses of data, sifting through thousands of data points, analyzing relationships among the data points, deciding priorities, and ultimately taking action. 
:\/:
: Automation at the data-collection stage saves analysts precious time. The best solutions gather data not only from open web sources, but also from the dark web and technical sources.
:\/:
: Through automation, advanced data science, and analytical techniques like natural language processing, effective brand intelligence tools enable analysts to link business attributes with related digital assets and detect, score, and prioritize events related to brand risk.
:\/:
: Robust brand intelligence solutions generate alerts and reports that provide information on how to remediate problems. They also integrate with tools that perform remediation immediately and with service providers that take down instances of domain abuse.

Static risk assessment methods often fall short. Spreadsheets, questionnaires, and email are labor-intensive, prone to error or bias, and only capture risk at a point in time.

Because businesses and their supply chains are so tightly integrated, it’s critical to consider the security of your partners, vendors, and other third parties when assessing the risk profile of your own organization. 
:\/:
A recent survey by the Ponemon Institute, “Digital Transformation & Cyber Risk: What You Need to Know to Stay Safe,” found that 55 percent of organizations have had a breach that originated from a third party, and 53 percent say their tools for managing third-party risk are only somewhat effective or are not effective. These and related statistics are shown in Figure 9-1. 
:\/:
The writing is on the wall: Third-party attacks will continue to increase and get worse and will further complicate cyber risk management. 
:\/:
Traditional third-party risk assessment methods rely on static outputs, like self-assessments, financial audits, monthly reports about new vulnerabilities discovered in the systems an organization uses, and occasional reports on the status of security control compliance. All of these become outdated quickly, and they don’t provide the comprehensive intelligence you need to make informed decisions about managing third-party risks to your organization. 
:\/:
In contrast, real-time security intelligence, specifically thirdparty intelligence, enables you to accurately assess risk posed by third parties and keep assessments current as conditions change and new threats emerge. 
:\/:
Many of the most common third-party risk management practices employed today lag behind security requirements. Static assessments of risk — like financial audits and security certificate verifications — are still important, but they often lack context and timeliness. 
:\/:
Organizations following traditional approaches to managing third-party risk often use these three steps: 
:\/:
They attempt to understand their organization’s business relationship with a third party and how it exposes their organization to threats.
:\/:
Based on that understanding, they identify frameworks to evaluate the third party’s financial health, corporate controls, and IT security and hygiene, as well as how these factors relate to their own organization’s approach to security.
:\/:
Using those frameworks, they assess the third party to determine whether it is compliant with security standards like SOC 2 or FISMA. Sometimes they conduct a financial audit of the third party.
:\/:
While these steps are essential for evaluating third-party risk, they don’t tell the whole story. The outputs are static and cannot reflect quickly changing conditions and emerging threats. The analysis is often too simplistic to produce actionable recommendations. Sometimes, the final report is opaque, making it impossible to dig deeper into the methodology behind the analysis. All of these factors create blind spots that leave decision-makers unsure whether crucial pieces of information might have been overlooked. 
:\/:
When assessing third-party risk, do not rely entirely on self reporting questionnaires or a vendor’s inwardly focused view of their own security defenses. Round these out with an external, unbiased perspective on the vendor’s threat landscape. 
:\/:
To accurately evaluate third-party risk in real time, you need a solution that offers immediate context on the current threat landscape. Security intelligence — delivered in the form of third-party intelligence — provides critical context that enables you to determine which shortcomings in your supply-chain partners’ defenses represent meaningful risks to your organization. Those include not only the risks present at the time of assessment, but also current risks and a historical view — which provide even more context to detect, prevent, and resolve risks. 
:\/:
To manage risk for your organization, you need access to massive amounts of threat data from a wide variety of sources across the open web, the dark web, as well as technical and news sources and discussion forums. The same applies to assessing risks introduced by the third parties in your supply chain.
:\/:
However, given the scale of cybersecurity-related content from these sources, totaling billions of facts, you need a third-party intelligence solution that uses automation and algorithms to collect and analyze these details. It must be able to: 
:\/:
Analyze, classify, connect, fuse, and index data points using natural language processing and multiple analytical models
:\/:
Static assessments quickly become outdated. Weekly or monthly intelligence reports produced by human analysts provide essential overviews, but often arrive too late to enable effective action. Risk scoring is much more effective when it updates in real time and draws on a large pool of sources. These capabilities make risk scores much more reliable for making immediate assessments and reaching security decisions. 
:\/:
For example, a trading partner might generally be regarded as low risk based on standard reporting. However, let’s say the partner suffers a data breach that may or may not affect your organization. If you rely solely on static risk assessments, you likely won’t know the breach happened in the first place — or you’ll find out too late. You may have to wait too long to acquire the intelligence needed to accurately evaluate the risk. What was the cause of the breach? Was it an exploited vulnerability in a system used by the partner? A social engineering attack? Static assessments alone do not provide the evidence required to justify asking that third party to put additional security controls in place. 
:\/:
If you want to boost the effectiveness of your third-party risk program, start by thinking critically about five key questions: 
:\/:
What’s the point of a risk assessment if you can’t use it to get your third parties to take action? 
:\/:
Information without context leaves us like Cassandra in Greek mythology. In a bid for her love, the god Apollo gave her the gift of prophecy, but still she scorned his romantic advances. In his anger, Apollo let her keep her foresight, but he cursed her so that nobody would ever believe her warnings about the future. 
:\/:
Many risk assessments today suffer the same fate as Cassandra’s prophecies. When we rely on vague scoring methods or opaque sourcing, our advice is hard to accept, even if it’s accurate. Too often, organizations fail to act on intelligence because leaders don’t understand it or don’t know the source. 
:\/:
A security intelligence solution must show the risk rules that are triggered by an alert — and be transparent about its sources (Figure 9-2). This enables security professionals to see for themselves why something like an alert on a particular IP address might represent a real risk. The extra detail also eliminates the suspicion that information might have been overlooked. This context allows for faster due diligence and reference checking, including when evaluating static assessments.

What do you do when faced with high risk scores for a third party? Not every data breach justifies terminating business with that partner. Just about every organization contends with cyberattacks and unexpected downtime, and partners are no exception. The more important issue is how they (and you) deal with incidents and take steps to reduce future risks. 
:\/:
A change in risk scores may present an opportunity to talk with your business partners about their approach to security. On your end, it’s important to look more closely at whether the risk rules that were triggered will impact your organization’s network. For example, a partner’s risk score might increase because typosquatting websites closely resembling legitimate websites operated by the partner were discovered. Putting those sites on the deny list in your own network is one way to thwart phishing campaigns while you investigate what steps that partner plans to take to protect its brand identity. 
:\/:
For smart security decisions that involve your third parties, you need up-to-the-minute context and evidence provided by third-party intelligence.

This chapter is one of many in our new book that demonstrates how to disrupt adversaries and measurably reduce risk with security intelligence at the center of your security program. Additional chapters explore different use cases, including the benefits of security intelligence for
