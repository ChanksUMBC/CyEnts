Why Monitoring the Dark Web is Essential for Third-Party Risk Management May 13, 2021 •\n

The dark web is often portrayed as vast, mysterious, and out of reach for companies without specialized expertise.

In reality, the dark web is one of the most over-hyped and misunderstood terms in the cybersecurity industry today.

However, if you cut through the noise, you’ll find that the dark web is an enormously valuable source of information for third-party risk management professionals.

What is the Dark Web?

The dark web is a subset of the Internet.

It’s accessible via special software such as Tor that allows users and website operators to remain anonymous or untraceable.

Websites on the dark web operate in their own unique environment, separated from surface sites such as Amazon, eBay, or Youtube.

Cybercriminals use the dark web to coordinate and execute cyber attacks, as well as to sell stolen data and even exploits into companies.

However, not all parts of the dark web are equal.

Many portions are accessible to anyone willing to download Tor.

The information you find in these relatively easy-to-access parts of the dark web are often of limited value.

Other parts of the dark web are invite-only, requiring special access that requires years of effort developing personas accepted among the cybercriminal community.

This closed part of the dark web is where one more often can find information of high value.

These closed channels, also known as the criminal underground, can extend beyond the proper dark web and into private criminal forums hosted on Telegram, Discord, and other places.

Why Does the Dark Web Matter for Third-Party Risk Management?

Third-party risk management teams are tasked with assessing risk across the entire full vendor lifecycle, from vendor selection to relationship termination.

When it comes to assessing cybersecurity risk, one of the most important questions to understand is “has my vendor recently experienced a cyber attack or breach?”

Unfortunately, current methods to assess this information – questionnaires, onsite audits, and  penetration testing – can’t fully answer this question.

The dark web provides a unique view into that you cannot get elsewhere, helping identify several high-risk factors that a vendor has, or is about to breached: Ransomware extortion.

Ransomware operators use extortion sites to threaten their victims into paying ransoms, under threat of publicly releasing stolen data.

While the practice is deplorable, these dark web sites provide an early warning signal that one of your third-parties has been struck by ransomware.

In some cases you can even use the sites to verify if any of your data was leaked via your third-party.

Stolen data .

Sensitive data including IP, PII, and HIPAA information frequently find their way to the dark web, likely indicating a breach of a third-party.

Leaked credentials.

Company email addresses and passwords are often for sale on the dark web.

Leaked credentials indicate a potential attack coming soon.

Company access for sale.

Some threat actors use the dark web to sell direct access to a company through a vulnerability.

By identifying the sale of these vulnerabilities, you can proactively stop future breaches of your third parties.

Cyber chatter.

Threat actors are known to discuss their recent attacks and upcoming plans on underground channels.

Keeping a close eye on mentions of your third parties can help you stay in front of breaches and upcoming cyber attacks.

Continuously Monitor the Dark Web with Third-Party Intelligence The dark web is too widespread and complex for any single individual to successfully monitor.

Third-party intelligence from Recorded Future does that work for you, by automatically collecting and analyzing posts from the dark to deliver high-confidence indicators of risk including ransomware extortion, leaked credentials, and high-volumes of attention on high-tier forums.

Third-party risk professionals use third-party intelligence to stay on top of their vendors, allowing them to proactively identify and mitigate risk as it surfaces.
