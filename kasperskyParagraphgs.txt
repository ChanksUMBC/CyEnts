Having analyzed the situation, MikroTik experts found no new vulnerabilities in the company’s routers; however, old ones may still pose a threat. Therefore, to ensure your router has not joined the Mēris botnet (or any other botnet, for that matter), you need to follow a few recommendations.
:\/:
: Winbox, a configuration tool for MikroTik routers through which many devices were compromised. Although MikroTik fixed the vulnerability back in 2018, apparently not all users updated their routers.
:\/:
Furthermore, even among those who did, not everyone followed the manufacturer’s additional password-change recommendations. If a user didn’t change the password, then even updated firmware could let attackers log in to the router and start exploiting it again.
:\/:
, the routers that are now infected with Mēris are the same devices that were compromised back in 2018. The company has published indicators of device compromise and issued recommendations.
:\/:
When a router joins a botnet, cybercriminals change a number of settings in the device firmware. Therefore, MikroTik’s first recommendation is to look at device configuration and check for the following:
:\/:
A rule that executes the script with the fetch () method. Remove this rule (under System → Scheduler), if present;
:\/:
A SOCKS proxy server enabled. You’ll find the setting under IP → SOCKS ; if you do not use it, disable it;
:\/:
An L2TP client called lvpn, (or any other L2TP client unfamiliar to you). Delete these clients as well;
:\/:
Regular updates are a crucial part of any successful defense strategy. Much of keeping a MikroTik network safe is following general network security best practices.
:\/:
Configure remote access — again, if you really need it — through a VPN channel. For example, use the IPsec protocol;
:\/:
Use a long and strong management password. Even if your current password is strong, change it now, just in case;
:\/:
In general, proceed under the assumption  that your local area network is not secure, meaning if one computer gets infected, then the malware can attack the router from inside your perimeter and gain access by brute-forcing passwords. That is why for our part, we strongly recommend using

Since the advent of cryptocurrency, scammers of every stripe have sought to get rich from stealing virtual coins. With cybercriminals duping both

 in 40 countries. Luno’s primary focus is on emerging markets, allowing users from countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, South Africa, and Nigeria to purchase tokens with local currency.
:\/:
Luno is a centralized exchange (CEX), meaning clients’ cryptowallet keys are stored on the exchange. Typically, such sites are well protected against hacking and leakage. However, account protection becomes much harder when owners spill their credentials to cybercriminals.
:\/:
The attackers who targeted Luno did not reinvent the wheel. Rather, they employed the tried-and-true method of playing on people’s desire for free cryptocurrency, sending potential victims e-mail messages, seemingly from the Luno team, saying that an incoming payment has been “placed on hold due to error(s)” in their profile data. The message includes a link for users to follow and solve the problem.
:\/:
As per usual with a phishing attack, the scammers forged the sender’s address, making the message look plausible. The strange address of the link lurking under the button, which looks nothing like luno.com and is located in the .ar domain zone (Argentina), might arouse suspicion.
:\/:
If the victim doesn’t notice this discrepancy and simply clicks, the link takes them through a chain of redirects to an illegitimate Luno login page. The fake resource is very similar in design to the real Luno site, but the cybercriminals did not even try to disguise the URL, apparently counting on user carelessness.
:\/:
To keep the cryptoinvestor victim from suspecting anything is amiss, the scammers even set strict security requirements. For example, to log in to the fake site, you need to enter a strong password with the same strict requirements as the official platform.
:\/:
Next, if the victim enters their credentials and tries to log in, the screen will display a 403 Forbidden error, and that’s it, the attackers now have the password — and access to the victim’s cryptocurrency.
:\/:
Phishing remains a viable method of stealing accounts and money on cryptocurrency platforms. That said, knowing a few simple rules will help minimize the risk of getting hooked.
:\/:
Be vigilant. Unexpected messages about large transfers, gifts, and winnings are nearly always a trick;
:\/:
Carefully check the URL in the address bar before entering credentials. Website spoofing is a common phishing technique;
:\/:
Don’t trust links in e-mails. Instead, bookmark the URLs of cryptocurrency wallets, exchanges, and other important services, and open them using your bookmarks;
:\/:
Use a unique password for each cryptocurrency service (and for all other sites and services as well) so that a hack or data leak on one resource won’t affect your other accounts;

Recent years have seen ransomware grow from an abstract curiosity into a major problem anyone can face — and that 
:\/:
, ransomware even shows a division of labor, with some criminals writing malicious code and others selecting targets and using the code to infect them, earning a percentage of the ransom.
:\/:
In the past couple of years, ransomers have focused increasingly on organizations, but that does not mean ordinary users are in the clear — people still get hit, sometimes even by accident. If you don’t want to lose your photos, documents, and other files, you cannot avoid picking up a few antiransomware skills and habits.
:\/:
Ransomware is malware that searches a hard drive for user-valuable information (such as documents, tables, images, and databases) and encrypts everything it finds, locking the files. Next, the ransomware displays a message demanding payment to restore the data.
:\/:
In some cases, the cybercriminals cannot recover the data even if they want to — some ransomware damages files irrevocably.
:\/:
 or links to malicious sites are the most common sources of infection. Perhaps the most unpleasant aspect of many ransomware programs is their ability to spread across devices on the same network. That means if your home desktop picks up malware, you can expect an attack on your laptop as well. And one piece of ransomware on a work device can bring all corporate communications to a standstill.
:\/:
Do not pay. Each ransom payment represents a financial contribution to malware development and a signal to the cybercriminals that the scheme is profitable. And it may not work — you may get nothing even if you comply.

 website to find out what malware has infected your drive. A decryptor may already exist for it, in which case you can use it to recover your data without spending a dime.
:\/:
If you’re unable to find a decryptor for the ransomware that attacked you, keep checking; one might be released any day.
:\/:
Now that you know the enemy, it’s time to learn a few information hygiene rules that can help you avoid ransomware.
:\/:
Regularly save important files and documents to a cloud storage and to an external hard drive. You can limit photo backups to once a week or even every month, but be sure to back up important, current documents every few days or even daily. Backing up your files doesn’t have to be a chore: See our 
:\/:
However you decide to back up your data, don’t delay. Having a backup in the event of a ransomware attack — or if the cat walks across the keyboard and deletes your report — means you don’t have to lose any work.
:\/:
Connect the backup hard drive only when you’re writing to or reading from it. Any drive connected to the computer at the time of a ransomware attack will be encrypted as well.
:\/:
E-mail attachments and infected websites are the most common hiding places for ransomware Trojans, so treat all unexpected e-mails and messages as potential sources of danger. What makes a message suspicious, though? It’s a gray area requiring consideration and judgment.
:\/:
Make sure you know the sender. Treat content, attachments and links in e-mails from strangers with the utmost skepticism. This applies to messages in messaging apps, social networks, and forums as well. If you have 
:\/:
To encounter such messages less often, configure spam filtering and mail traffic scanning in your security solution.
:\/:
If you receive a suspicious link or file that you weren’t expecting from someone you do know, contact them by phone or in another format; their account or mailbox may have been compromised.
:\/:
Not limiting themselves to links in e-mails, cybercriminals employ a formidable array of tricks to dupe victims into downloading malware. If clicking on a banner results in an unexpected Web resource appearing, or the screen prompting you to download something, close the page immediately. You are very likely seeing an infection attempt.
:\/:
To penetrate devices, cybercriminals often exploit known vulnerabilities that developers have already patched. Anyone who doesn’t update their software regularly is at particular risk. Turn on automatic updates wherever possible, and regularly

 includes a range of tools to protect users against ransomware. Even in the unlikely event that a particularly cunning piece of malware makes it past file antivirus protection, it won’t be able to do much: Kaspersky Internet Security analyzes the actions of running apps and blocks attempts to encrypt files or rolls back the actions of malicious programs if they manage to damage any data.

 that a version of popular WhatsApp mod FMWhatsApp includes an embedded Trojan. The Trojan, called Triada, downloads other malware to users’ devices. Here’s how it happened and why using modified versions of WhatsApp is dangerous.
:\/:
Not all users are happy with the official WhatsApp app. Some may feel a need for self-destructing messages or, conversely, the ability to view messages another user deleted. Others are after dynamic themes, and still others want to hide certain chats from the general list or automatically translate messages.
:\/:
Naturally, they want these features right away, not when WhatsApp’s developers finally get around to implementing them. As a result, some users turn to the modified WhatsApp clients available online, which are fairly numerous and not hard to find.
:\/:
The creators of WhatsApp mods often embed ads in them — understandably — along with the features users are looking for. Problems arise, however, from their use of third-party ad modules through which malicious code can sneak in under developers’ radar.
:\/:
That’s precisely what happened with FMWhatsApp, a popular WhatsApp mod. In version 16.80.0 the developers use third-party ad module that includes a Trojan. Our 
:\/:
We saw a similar situation in the spring of 2021 with the APKPure unofficial app store, whose developers also used an ad module from an unverified source, thereby 
:\/:
As in the case of the infected APKPure, the Triada Trojan in the dangerous version of the FMWhatsApp mod performs an intermediary function. First, it collects data about the user’s device, and then, depending on the information, it downloads another Trojan.
:\/:
Triada’s “extras” come in a variety of flavors — the infected version of FMWhatsApp downloads several types of malware to devices:
:\/:
Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Gapac.e, which downloads and runs other malicious modules and can also display full-screen ads at unexpected moments;
:\/:
Trojan.AndroidOS.Whatreg.b, the most complex Trojan in the list, signs in to the WhatsApp account on the victim’s phone, intercepting the login confirmation text. The device can then become a site for various types of illegal activity such as spam distribution or illegal trading.
:\/:
Practicing caution and using your device safely is key to keeping malware and other mobile nasties off your phone. Generally speaking, follow these tips to avoid trouble:
:\/:
Avoid installing apps from unofficial sources and use your device’s settings to deny permission to install them. (If you need to install an app not from an official store, temporarily enable that permission and then disable it again);
:\/:
Use only official messaging apps, and download them only from official app stores — they may lack some features, but will not flood your phone with viruses;
:\/:
So long as gamers seek out free apps in the form of unlicensed copies, cracks, and other goodies, cybercriminals will continue to prey on them, and we will continue to spotlight the dangers gamers face. Here are some we’ve found over the past year.
:\/:
 who skimped on both gaming and security, ending up with unexpected apps along with (or instead of) the games they thought they were downloading.
:\/:
Perhaps the most common surprise greedy gamers find in their popular games is adware. Although not usually too harmful, adware can be very annoying. With this uninvited guest on their computer or smartphone, users will constantly be closing banners, pop-up videos, and browser pages they didn’t open.
:\/:
In the hierarchy of bad stuff users might get with pirated games, cryptominers rank far higher than adware. Gamers, with their souped-up computers and brawny video cards, make ideal targets for cryptocurrency freeloaders — and a miner concealed inside a game with high system requirements can go unnoticed for quite some time, during which the computer is working for a malicious third party.
:\/:
Most gamers know that the place to get official games is a specialized store such as Steam. But for a “Minecraft crack” or “virus-free FIFA,” they turn to search engines. Cybercriminals take advantage of this, creating websites offering free keys, cracks, and unlocked versions of games; adding Trojans; and pushing them onto the first page of search results. Alternatively, they can load infected, pirated copies onto existing warez sites.
:\/:
 get sent through a long chain of redirects to a page with a ZIP archive, inside of which is another password-protected ZIP and a text file with a key. Unzipping the archive loads Swarez on the unfortunate gamer’s device, where it proceeds to download Taurus spyware, a Trojan that takes screenshots and steals cryptowallets, desktop files, and passwords and other data stored in browsers.
:\/:
 remains very popular cyberattack bait, including on smartphones and tablets. Back in 2020, we found 
:\/:
 malware, which reports an installation error and prompts the user to uninstall the app. In fact, that removes only the icon; the malware remains, working in stealth mode to harvest online bank credentials.
:\/:
When run, the malware appears to load very slowly — and then, nothing. The victim, seeing the game is not working, quits. The icon disappears from the screen at that point, but the Trojan remains on the device and gets to work.
:\/:
What’s actually happening during that fake startup is data collection: Vesub collects system data and receives further instructions. Then, running in the background, it can subscribe the victim to paid services, send text messages from their smartphone, play YouTube videos, visit app pages on Google Play, and open advertising websites.
:\/:
By now you should understand quite well that downloading pirated games is far more trouble than it’s worth. If so, your gaming experience just became a lot safer. However, you should know about another way cybercriminals exploit gamers’ quest for freebies: offering bundles of games at a 99% discount, promising mountains of free or near-free in-game currency, and inviting players to take part in nonexistent tournaments.
:\/:
 — cybercriminals scoop up victims’ e-mail addresses, social network names and login credentials, and game info. Even without passwords, such information fetches a price on the 
:\/:
. Need we state that by entering your password on an unofficial site, you run the risk of losing your account?
:\/:
Even worse is if the victim, asked for payment card details for “verification,” agrees. What happens next, you know only too well.
:\/:
The risks gamers face are neither new nor particularly unusual. Although gamers appear to be a relatively risk-tolerant group, you can practice safe gaming by following some commonsense tips:
:\/:
, and you need not walk into traps. For example, publishers hold sales regularly and even host the occasional giveaway. By waiting for official discounts, you not only minimize the chance of a run-in with malware, but also support the developers and get the latest patches for your favorite games in good time.
:\/:
Be careful when downloading games. Cybercriminals often promote malicious pages that appear to be well-known online stores. Unfortunately, you cannot trust search engines completely, here. Just download the platform’s official app (if it has one), bookmark its website, or enter the URL manually.

If you run a popular blog and promote your business through Instagram, an account ban simply isn’t in the plan. For responsible users, the idea of being banned for, say, displaying suicidal content or trying to impersonate someone else might seem like a bad dream or a cruel joke, but it’s quite real for victims of the new wave of so-called ban attacks. Here’s how these attacks work, how to defend against them, and what to do if your account has been hit.
:\/:
It’s all quite simple: Detractors or competitors can pay a fee (the amount depends on the seller or even the number of followers) to have your profile blocked.
:\/:
The group’s favored tactic is the fake impersonation complaint, which involves verified accounts, identifiable by the blue check next to the username. The attackers use verified accounts to create a full copy of the victim’s profile, right down to the avatar and description. Then they file a complaint against the original, accusing the owner of impersonation. If the victim’s account is not verified, the support service bans the victim.
:\/:
The second blocking method is to inundate tech support with messages alleging that the victim’s profile contains images of suicide or self-mutilation. In many cases, Instagram takes the easier path, blocking accounts on the basis of such complaints without first checking their actual content.
:\/:
 that still require action from the victim — clicking a dangerous link, for example — a ban attack works with no victim participation whatsoever. The target, who might never even dream of violating the terms of use, simply finds their account blocked.
:\/:
 reporters, the service is inexpensive, running about $5 to $60, so the cybercriminals have no shortage of customers.
:\/:
However, not all users who abuse Instagram’s moderation practices are in it to make money. Malicious scripts are freely available, and any online hooligan can use them to settle a personal score or silence a disagreeable blogger.
:\/:
In fact, blocking Instagram accounts opens up another money-generating avenue: restoring them. Unblocking carries a far higher fee than blocking — reportedly up to $3,500–$4,000.
:\/:
Whether the same people are behind the banning and the unblocking services, or whether it’s an accidental symbiosis, remains unclear for now. Some users do receive an offer to reinstate their account just a few minutes after the blocking, however, and those offers often come from followers of the accounts from which the original complaints came.
:\/:
If you’re already the victim of a ban attack, contact Instagram support immediately with an explanation of what happened. Bans are 
:\/:
If anyone comes knocking with an offer to restore your account for money, don’t pay! First, you have no guarantee that anything will come of it. Second, doing so supports confirmed miscreants — perhaps even the ones who got your account banned in the first place. Third, the official recovery procedure through Instagram support is free.
:\/:
 that it plans to sniff out cybercriminal accounts on the platform, and asks users to report any suspicious activity, but that approach is time-consuming. In the meantime, we suggest you take some measures to protect yourself.
:\/:
The ban-attack business centers on accusations of impersonation, so the best way to protect yourself is to convince Instagram that you are you before anything happens. In other words, you should verify your account now.
:\/:
The social network won’t check every user, but you may have some points in your favor. For example, if you or your business has been mentioned in 
:\/:
, that helps. To get the coveted blue check mark, you’ll want to complete your profile and delete any old accounts to avoid arousing suspicion. Naturally, the account must also be public and not violate Instagram’s terms of use.
:\/:
What if you’re not famous enough to pass blue-check verification? You can take the radical step of closing your account to the public. If you make your account private, then your posts, photos, and videos will be available only to subscribers, which means that an attacker won’t be able to copy them and accuse you of impersonation.
:\/:
Be sure to take the trouble to clean up your list of followers as well, and check future follower requests before accepting them. Bots and other barely there accounts can hide attackers, and you’re under no obligation to let them in.
:\/:
For business profiles that you cannot close but that aren’t well-known enough for verification — or that you feel you must keep open for any other reason — there’s another way to reduce the risk of ban attacks: Change your avatar.
:\/:
Fake impersonation complaints work best on profiles with a real photo of the owner. Some underground ban-attack services even refuse to target accounts with other avatars. That means putting up something that isn’t your portrait complicates attempts to do harm; every bit helps.
:\/:
Instagram admins do what they can to combat wrongful complaints, but they’re working against cybercriminals who continually improve their money-making schemes. In a perfect world you wouldn’t have to, but here and now, you should prepare an escape route.
:\/:
First, make sure you have access to the e-mail address and phone number linked to your profile. If your account is wrongfully blocked, you can use them for recovery.
:\/:
With the colossal amount of telephone scamming these days, you’d be hard-pressed to find a phone owner anywhere on the planet who hasn’t been 
:\/:
. But like all forms of cold calling, phone scams are resource-intensive and highly inefficient. Therefore, some scammers try to optimize the process by getting potential victims to call 
:\/:
We recently detected several waves of spam e-mails, seemingly from reputable companies, notifying recipients of substantial purchases. The item in question is usually a high-end device such as the latest Apple Watch or a gaming laptop purchased from Amazon or paid for through PayPal.
:\/:
Other, more exotic variants crop up from time to time. For example, we detected an e-mail about the purchase of $1,999 worth of “Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin)”:
:\/:
Fake PayPal notification, including the scammers’ phone number, of a “Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin)” purchase
:\/:
Other, similar notifications mention the purchase of security software licenses — we’ve seen some referring to Norton and even Kaspersky (although our product lineup has never included a “Kaspersky Total Protection.”)
:\/:
Fake notifications about the purchase of Norton and “Kaspersky Total Protection” licenses with vishing phone numbers
:\/:
The scam relies on recipients being so alarmed by the not-insubstantial loss that they will act rashly, hoping to get their money back.
:\/:
Of course, their money hasn’t gone anywhere — at least, not yet. This particular strain of spam e-mails contain no links, but they do include a phone number that the victim is asked to call if they want to change or cancel the order. Sometimes the number sits unobtrusively somewhere at the bottom of the text. Other times it is highlighted in red and repeated several times in the message.
:\/:
What happens if you call? Most likely the scammers will try to wangle your login credentials for some financial service or bank card details. Alternatively, they might try to trick you into transferring money or even installing a Trojan on your computer, which 
:\/:
The particulars may change, but all scams have certain elements in common: the use of some sort of trick to get someone to do something. Vishing is no different. Follow these guidelines for safety:
:\/:
Log in to your account with the service in question — type the address into your browser; don’t click on any links in the message — and check your orders or recent activity page;
:\/:
Check your balance and the list of recent transactions on all of your cards, if you have reason for concern;
:\/:
For employees facing hundreds of e-mails, the temptation to speed-read and download attachments on autopilot can be great. Cybercriminals, of course, take advantage, sending out seemingly important documents that might contain just about anything from 
:\/:
Both e-mails were disguised as business correspondence. In the first case, the attackers demanded compensation for some bogus reason or said something about canceling an operation. Attached to the message was a zipped Excel file named CompensationClaim plus a series of numbers. The second spam mailing had to do with payments and contracts and included a link to the hacked website where the archive containing the document was stored.
:\/:
In both cases, the attackers’ aim was to persuade the recipient to open the malicious Excel file and run the macro in it, thus downloading either IcedID or (less commonly) Qbot to the victim’s machine.
:\/:
. Moreover, attackers are constantly honing their techniques. For example, at one point they hid the main component of IcedID in a PNG image using a trick called 
:\/:
Today, both malware programs are available on the shadow market; in addition to their creators, numerous clients distribute the Trojans. The malware’s main task is to steal bank card details and login credentials for bank accounts, preferably business accounts (hence the businesslike e-mails). To achieve their objectives, the Trojans employ various methods. For example, they may:
:\/:
Unfortunately, theft of payment data is not the only trouble that awaits victims. For example, IcedID can download other malware, including ransomware, to infected devices. Meanwhile, Qbot’s tricks include 
:\/:
 for use in further spam campaigns, and providing its operators with remote access to victims’ computers. On work machines in particular, the consequences can be serious.
:\/:
No matter how crafty cybercriminals can be, you don’t need to reinvent the wheel to stay safe. Both of the spam campaigns in question rely on recipients taking risky actions — if they don’t open the malicious file and let it execute the macro, the scheme simply will not work. To reduce your chances of becoming a victim:
:\/:
Check the sender’s identity, including the domain name. Someone claiming to be a contractor or a corporate client but using a Gmail address, for example, may be suspicious. And if you simply don’t know who the sender is, check with colleagues;
:\/:
Prohibit macros by default, and treat documents that require you to enable macros or other content with suspicion. Never run a macro unless you’re absolutely sure the file needs it — and is safe;
:\/:
. If you work on a personal device, or your employer is lax when it comes to workstation protection, make sure it’s protected. Our products detect both IcedID and Qbot.
:\/:
Between tech support requesting access to your computer, concerned tax services specialists demanding payments, medical equipment suppliers “returning your call,” and many more — none legitimate — it’s a wonder anyone even answers their phone anymore. You’d be hard-pressed to find someone who hasn’t experienced some form of phone scam, although the name for it isn’t as well-known: vishing.
:\/:
), and, aided by the mass transition to remote work, it has turned the phone into a major weapon of fraud, to the extent that law-enforcement agencies now periodically release 
:\/:
 data from the US Federal Trade Commission, only 6% of scam calls ended in financial loss. Nevertheless, when it happened, the damage was quite significant, with a median value of $960.
:\/:
On the one hand, vishing is more conservative than regular phishing, because the telephone itself is an older means of communication. On the other hand, 
:\/:
 in the digital age have lent voice scams new power: Never before have scammers been in possession of such volumes of information about almost everyone on the planet. The proliferation of Internet telephony (VoIP) further plays into the hands of cybercriminals, enabling them to manipulate phone numbers and cover their tracks.
:\/:
Scammers can say just about anything on a call, but their attempts tend to fall into a few main categories.
:\/:
Telemarketing fraud tends to involve offers too good to be true and pressure too time-sensitive to end well. Some examples include winning the lottery (bonus points it you didn’t even buy a ticket), a reduced credit card interest rate, and other lucrative offers that are hard to refuse. They tend to have in common the need to make a decision on the spot, plus a small advance payment from you to them.
:\/:
If you have the time to think about the offer, it’s (usually) clearly fraudulent. If you make the payment, it’ll just go to the scammers, literally rewarding them for their crime and also reinforcing the value of using leaked databases of phone numbers to call and defraud thousands more people.
:\/:
One of the most common schemes involves allegedly unpaid or underpaid taxes. A “tax office” initiates the call and provides a choice: Pay the arrears or face a fine. The offer expires soon, after which the fine will increase.
:\/:
Again, adding time-sensitivity works. Given time to think about how tax agencies communicate with citizens, not to mention their deadline structures, the average citizen could probably figure out that such calls are fraudulent. Faced with a ticking clock and (apparently) a government agency known for strictness, however, adjusts the odds in scammers’ favor.
:\/:
For unsolicited tech-support calls, scammers choose large, well-known brands to increase the chances of connecting with an actual user of the product. The caller typically claims to have found an issue with the victim’s computer and asks for login credentials or remote access to their computer.
:\/:
A more sophisticated scheme involves some preparation, for example, infecting a computer with malware that invokes a pop-up window with a description of the alleged problem and a phone number to call to get it fixed.
:\/:
The ultimate object of any scam is money, so of course some fraudsters pretend to call from banks. Generally, they claim to be reporting suspicious account activity, which in reality gives them cover to request details such as a CVC/CVV code or a one-time passcode from a text message. Armed with such details, the fake bank employee can easily clean out an account for real.
:\/:
We can’t discount the notion that scammers, always on the lookout for more-convincing hooks, might someday learn from fraud’s rich history of tells, but most scams exhibit at least one of several red flags.
:\/:
If a call supposedly from a bank or government agency comes from a cell number, it’s almost certainly vishing. Double those odds if the phone number is from a different region. However, an official-looking number is no guarantee of a legitimate call; modern technologies allow 
:\/:
If a caller tries to extract confidential information, especially in a threatening manner, that too is a sign of vishing. In general, any attempt to find out private information is an indication of fraud: any information a real bank or tax office employee needs about you, they probably already have — remember, we’re talking about communication 
:\/:
If a caller tries to persuade you to install software on your computer to fix some problem they called to tell you about, it will probably end badly for you.
:\/:
Finally, an indirect but still reliable sign of vishing is if the caller gets confused, misspeaks, is hostile, or uses slang expressions. We have nothing against everyday speech, of course, but real operators are generally trained to use professional language.
:\/:
If you spot at least one of the above red flags, the best option is simply to end the conversation. After that, call the company or organization that supposedly just called you and report the incident — the more information they collect, the more likely they are to catch, or at least hinder, the fraudsters. Look up the tech or customer support number separately, for example by going to the organization’s official website.
:\/:
In addition, resolutely avoid installing remote access programs on your computer, however convincing any caller may be, and use a 
:\/:
When scammers target gamers, they are typically pursuing gaming accounts. Today, we’re discussing a different target: players’ gold. As games go, the massively popular 
:\/:
 an original scam used at the World of Warcraft Classic Auction House. The player, who was trying to buy a stack of Chronoboon Displacers for 66 gold coins, instead had more than 11,000 gold coins deducted from his account. He had become a victim of a malicious script in an add-on he had installed. Here is how to protect yourself and avoid a similar fate in 
:\/:
. With them, you can customize the interface, filter out in-game chat spam, and do much more. For example, a popular add-on called WeakAuras can help you set up convenient access to information such as the amount of time before a boss’ next high-damage attack, a warning that you are under a curse that inflicts damage to nearby players, the mana reserve levels of raid healers, and so on.
:\/:
WeakAuras is essentially a framework: all timers and indicators are added to the base add-Аon using scripts written in Lua programming language, commonly called “auras”. Many sites offer ready-made assemblies of auras for specific classes, specializations, and even professions. Sometimes, though, players are looking for something specific, such as an aura for a single quest or an experimental tactic. Some players versed in programming customize existing scripts or create auras themselves.
:\/:
And sometimes, in a raid with random partners, an unfamiliar raid leader may demand, “we are using a new tactic to fight this boss — everyone needs to install this aura right now”, and send a link. Of course, the decision is yours, but anyone who doesn’t install the aura can expect to be kicked out of the raid. Worse, leaders usually drop those links into raid chats, and most players simply click on the name and install scripts without a second thought.

It is important to remember that using these scripts, which are also linked on message boards or in in-game chats, can be risky. With no centralized validation mechanism, stuffing auras with malicious surprises is easy, and unless you know Lua, you cannot check the code. In addition, a deceptive aura may behave like a bona fide script until it is triggered by certain conditions. Scammers take advantage of that in Azeroth.
:\/:
The malicious script lies in wait, behaving normally until a player who has installed it stocks up on certain consumables (say, elixirs, ore, or herbs) at the Auction House. As soon as the player selected the desired item, the script redirects the query to an identical product that the scammer is selling for 10,000 coins. At the same time, the script replaces the system message confirming the purchase with a fake one, showing the original price, say 5 coins. That way, despite making and confirming a small purchase, the player finds their account has been charged 10,000 instead.
:\/:
The scammer can spend the gold in the game, although exchanging it for real money is more typical. It is with good reason that Blizzard support 
:\/:
 is known for showing zero tolerance to cheaters. Blizzard’s licensing agreement prohibits changes to the game’s source code and the use of tools that give some players advantages over others, as well as any interference with game-play. So, how did the auction fraud go unnoticed?
:\/:
It was because the scripts affect the interface only through WeakAuras tools, which are allowed. As far as the system is concerned, if players want to pay thousands of gold pieces for items worth pennies, that’s their choice. On top of that, most players need some help to figure out which of their many add-ons caused them to lose money. That gives cybercriminals the time they need to trick lots of users before their scheme is exposed.
:\/:
Scammers rightly believe players will need some time to realize they are being cheated at the Auction House (controlled by Blizzard), or that the source of the problem is a script that never caused them any trouble before. Instead of relying on the game, be proactive and keep yourself safe.
:\/:
During the discussion on Reddit, an expert analyzed the victim’s installed add-ons and scripts, found the malicious one, and reported the finding to WeakAuras’ developers. The developers fixed the problem, so even if you have the malicious script installed, updating WeakAuras to the latest version should remove it automatically.
:\/:
That measure is unlikely to be effective against yet-unknown malicious auras. To protect WeakAuras from dangerous scripts reliably, its developers would need to implement a basic antivirus engine, regularly check existing auras, and add any malicious ones to a database. That’s a lot of work, though.
:\/:
This particular tip wouldn’t have helped with the scheme we describe above, but it may prove generally useful. Scammers can try to deceive you without using any tricky add-ons, for example, by replacing an item with something much cheaper immediately after you enter the amount in the window, or by quickly removing a couple of zeros from their payment amount when buying. Therefore, before confirming any transaction, we recommend waiting an extra few seconds and carefully checking the item and purchase amount. Consult our 
:\/:
If you find yourself in a similar situation, share the news. Contact support and start a message board thread, and attach screenshots and a list of your add-ons in each case. You can expect moderators and experienced players to offer advice, help with next steps, and perhaps even find a way to punish the scammers. In asking for help, you will also help by alerting other players, and you might get your gold back as well, as Legitamasterr did.

 as well. Even though it probably won’t detect a cheat script for a WoW add-on, it will keep you safe from most malicious and dangerous sites and programs.
:\/:
In almost every post about Android, we recommend installing apps from official sources only, and that won’t change anytime soon. A recent example illustrates why: Scammers were spreading a banking Trojan disguised as popular media players, a fitness app, a book reader, and one that hit close to home, Kaspersky Internet Security for Android.
:\/:
Nothing is wrong with third-party app marketplaces per se, but no one can know for sure whether any given store is trustworthy. In an official Android app store, be it Google Play or Huawei AppGallery, employees of the respective owner companies screen every application submitted by developers, weeding out any that are clearly malicious. These are large companies that protect their reputations and customers’ security, and they have both the resources and the motivation to help keep users malware-free.
:\/:
, and even into Google Play, although the chances of encountering it there are much lower than on message boards, torrent trackers, or some other sites. Proudly small, independent marketplaces tend not to run many checks, typically because they lack the resources, and as a result, the apps they host could be anything in disguise, even a Trojan.
:\/:
We should mention here that downloading malware to an Android device is not usually enough to infect it. Unless the malware relies on some kind of 
:\/:
, installing a dangerous app in Android requires some effort. The operating system queries the user about every step: whether they really want to install the app, whether they agree to grant it the permissions it requests, and so on. Cybercriminals employ social engineering to persuade people to say yes, often with great success.
:\/:
 on Android applications spreading through various fake sites. The apps included a fake version of Kaspersky Internet Security for Android.
:\/:
The scammers were spreading their fake app with the name “Kaspersky Free Antivirus” (we used to offer a product with that name, but it was for Windows). On Google Play, our mobile antivirus app is currently called 
:\/:
Ironically, users who downloaded the fake antivirus app received a banking Trojan known as TeaBot, which our security products detect as HEUR: Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Teaban or HEUR: Trojan-Banker.AndroidOS.Regon.
:\/:
Why is this especially problematic in the case of antivirus apps? It’s because the user not only downloads and installs a banking Trojan disguised like this, but also grants it all of the permissions it requests. After all, an authentic antivirus app needs a lot of permissions, including very powerful access such as 
:\/:
Completing installation and granting all requested permissions gives the TeaBot Trojan the ability to do almost anything on the Android device. Its capabilities are many: from 
:\/:
, stealing Google Authenticator codes, and exploiting Accessibility in other ways all the way to gaining full remote control of the Android device.
:\/:
Antivirus isn’t TeaBot’s only disguise. The malware is also available as fake versions of some well-known government, financial, fitness, and reading apps, among others. To stay safe, turn off your smartphone’s ability to install applications from unknown sources altogether — Android allows that. And if you need an app of any kind, find it on an official marketplace.
:\/:
. If a fitness app unexpectedly requests permission to use Accessibility, for example, think twice (or more) before answering.

-themed malware continues to pop up in Google Play. Instead of doing anything they claimed, the apps turned users’ smartphones and tablets into extremely intrusive advertising tools.
:\/:
To be clear, the apps were totally useless from a user perspective. Instead, after the first run they hid their icons and repeatedly opened the browser to flash ads. They could also play videos from YouTube, open Google Play app pages, and more. The version we analyzed, for example, opened the browser every two minutes, rendering the device essentially unusable. The thing was especially troubling, because it was extremely hard for a user to figure out what was going on, which app was responsible for the troubles and how to stop it.
:\/:
Deletion from Google’s app store does not necessarily defeat malware; historically, its makers simply upload new, slightly modified, versions using different names and from different developer accounts.
:\/:
One example of the cycle comes from the VK Music Trojan, which stole VK user accounts and, despite being reported, dug in to Google Play 
:\/:
Mindful of that, we revisited the case of the harmful Minecraft modpacks in Google Play to find out whether reporting had helped. To that end, we launched a search for similar apps — and found some.
:\/:
First, we found several apps using the abovementioned approach, but with some improvements. In a basic scenario the apps accept push message commands from the attackers to show full-screen ads (no user interaction required). The apps are designed to download an extra module as well. With that module downloaded, more functions become available, enabling the apps to hide their icons, run the browser, play YouTube videos, open Google Play app pages, and so forth.
:\/:
This time, the list of compromised apps included, in addition to Minecraft mods, a file recovery utility called 
:\/:
. Version 1.1.0, available from Google Play until February 2021 had a malicious payload. That version has been removed, and version 1.1.1, which is now on Google Play, is safe.
:\/:
Second, we found a couple of Minecraft modpacks with basic functionality, a configuration in which the apps occasionally show full screen ads, even with the app inactive, but are unable to hide their icons or run the browser, YouTube, or Google Play. For extra monetization, the in-app purchases function is used.
:\/:
Interestingly, one of the apps is now available from the store as a “basic” version and with in-app purchases enabled, whereas a couple of months back it relied on the extra downloadable module. From this we conclude that their owners are continuing to experiment with monetization options.
:\/:
Third, we found several more apps were found in which the described above malicious functionality was not the core one. A while ago, for example, Google Play carried a fake Madgicx advertising network app and a fake TikTok ad-management app that would insistently prompt for the user’s Facebook account data and, if user provided it, would steal the account.
:\/:
Finally, many such apps remain available from alternative stores even after Google removes them from its store. Which is no surprise; even Google, with vastly more resources than the average company, can’t always promptly moderate the great volume of existing apps. Yet we decided to mention this aspect here, as it provides clear evidence that alternative stores are unsafe to use. If still intending to use them for whatsoever reason, at least install a 
:\/:
, even if you download your apps only from Google Play, you are still better off with an antivirus on your smartphone.
:\/:
. Before making them available for free trading on cryptoexchanges, makers of new cryptocurrencies release some tokens — typically to raise initial funds for the project. On the buyer side, speculators are hoping to profit — that the market rate will increase. That makes ICOs similar to IPOs (initial public offerings) on the stock market.
:\/:
, ICOs increased from only 49 ICOs in 2016 to more than 1,000 in 2018. The financial increase is no less impressive: from $252 million to $19.7 billion.
:\/:
Broadly, there are capped and uncapped placements. In the former case, the issuer clearly states the sum to be collected and the number of tokens up for trading — as a result, there may not be enough coins to cover the demand.
:\/:
Uncapped placements continue, as the name suggests, nonstop throughout the ICO. The organizers never stop collecting money, hoping to bring in as many investors and as much money as possible. But an unlimited supply may dampen investor interest, of course, so organizers have to hype the placement.
:\/:
There are also several distribution options. For example, in some ICOs, advance requests are processed based on an FCFS (First Come First Serve) basis; in others, whoever offers the highest price wins the assets at auction.
:\/:
Then we have the randomized queue, an alternative format that’s been gaining traction of late, in which the traders register on the project website well in advance but learn their number only after they are in the queue and trading begins. In other words, potential cryptoinvestors can’t know until the last moment whether they will get the coveted assets.
:\/:
Those who get nothing risk falling victim to FOMO (fear of missing out, a term investors use for anxiety due to lost profit or opportunity) — that is, getting nervous and letting their guard down.
:\/:
FOMO is at the heart of many scams. Lately, for example, we’ve been seeing mass messaging to members of cryptocurrency communities in Discord, with emoji-rich text advertising a new round of an uncapped ICO allegedly being held by a (real) leading-edge blockchain startup — Mina in our example, but there are others as well. Just like every other fraud scheme, this one tries to rush potential victims into following a link to the “official” website.
:\/:
Incidentally, the real Mina did hold a placement not long ago, in the randomized queue format, and many who registered got no coins. The new scheme exploits that history.
:\/:
The message contains links to what looks like the real Mina page. The Mina project is dedicated to creating a minimalistic blockchain, so the Mina website is also minimalistic to the extreme — which spared the scammers the effort of building a comprehensive fake. Visitors are required to complete a simple registration: name, e-mail address, and, for some reason, a link to their social network page.
:\/:
The scammers claim to have streamlined the ICO process: “Make a cryptocurrency payment to the specified wallet and get your tokens.” In fact, the next prompt, right after registration, requests a cryptocurrency selection and payment amount.
:\/:
The token “purchasing” process is designed to be as simple as possible — select one of three popular cryptocurrencies …
:\/:
Once the currency and sum are specified, the payment alone remains — the website offers to copy the address of the scammers’ cryptocurrency wallet or scan its QR code.
:\/:
Once they have pocketed the money, the criminals apologize for the delay, citing necessary confirmations in the blockchain network, which, unfortunately, is under heavy load at the moment. They ask investors to be patient and wait for three hours before contacting support, should the coins fail to arrive.
:\/:
It should come as no surprise that the investors will never get their coins — their money are gone for good. Apparently, some people have already fallen victim to the scheme. For example, as of the time of this publication, the wallet specified on the fake Mina page had received 0.2 BTC in payments (more than $7,000 — again, as of the time of this publication).
:\/:
To stay clear of the scheme described, follow these simple rules — they’re good for just about any situation.
:\/:
 Consider the incoming message soberly. In the fake Mina example, ask yourself why such a generous (weird but generous) offer would have no buzz in specialized communities? Could the sender be trying to exploit your FOMO? Why the need to use no link but the one in the letter? Why does the letter ask you to spread the information among your contacts? There’s no proof of scam here, but plenty of food for thought.
:\/:
 Visit the issuer’s official website by typing its address into your browser’s address bar. Read any coverage of the ICO project on specialized resources. Check the real cryptoproject servers in Discord, which stay on top of scams and post warnings. However you choose to research and verify, never drop your guard: Scammers have built entire

:\/:
The pandemic has left tens of millions of people around the world effectively jobless, and scammers, never ones to miss an opening, have been targeting freelancers and job seekers more frequently. Today, we look at an unusually sophisticated scam aimed at artists and designers.
:\/:
The story begins with ArtStation, a site where artists publish their portfolios in categories such as game art, anime, comics, media, and film production. It is normal for site users to receive personal e-mails from potential customers.
:\/:
Since last year, however, ArtStation freelancers have found themselves targeted by highly professional cybercriminals posing as employees of major game developers including 2K, Big Fish, Bluepoint, and Riot Games.
:\/:
One user, a US-based concept artist, received what looked like an invitation for an interview with 2K, publisher of such titles as 
:\/:
. The position came with a good salary and the option to work remotely. The e-mail was well crafted and included many details that are usually indicative of an HR professional.
:\/:
The contractor carefully studied the message, which looked nothing like ordinary spam. Even the sender’s domain appeared legitimate: @2kgamesjobs.com. In between the terms of employment and links to LinkedIn profiles, the alleged employer stated that the interview would be held on Telegram and included a link to download and install the app. The artist downloaded the messaging app and contacted the alleged recruiter.
:\/:
At this point most scammers would pivot straight to extortion, but these ones remained in character for quite a while longer. They conducted a long and in-depth interview with the artist, but not over a video or even voice call, which is what we’d expect from a legitimate company, but rather in text 
:\/:
. Still, not for one second did the artist get the sense it was all a sham. The fake recruiter’s questions required professional knowledge of perspective, color theory, and shading. The test seemed real, and the artist was relieved to pass it.
:\/:
Now all that stood between the artist and the perfect job was a couple of formal procedures: some software and hardware requirements including a MacBook Pro with certain specs, a graphic-design package, a screen-calibration tool, and a time-tracking system — nothing implausible, but the equipment had to be purchased from a particular vendor. In return, the artist could expect an advance payment check.
:\/:
However, the mandatory purchase of equipment was enough to make the artist suspect that something was amiss. The artist found a 
:\/:
 on 2K’s website about “bad actors posing as company HR personnel” and stopped communicating with the scammers.
:\/:
If the artist had continued to communicate with the fraudsters after the phony interview, they would indeed receive a check, which would appear to come from 2K’s finance department and be delivered by a real FedEx courier, which again shows how much effort the scammers put into the operation.
:\/:
However, the check does not stand up to scrutiny. It looks real; the lettering on the stub even suggests the presence of a watermark on the back. But it’s just a piece of paper printed on an ordinary color printer. The scammers try to time its arrival for late on a Friday afternoon so the recipient won’t have time to go to the bank and verify its authenticity.
:\/:
, which can take several days. Most banks do not work on weekends, so the scammers figure the new “employee” will simply pay for the equipment out of their own pocket that very weekend, assuming the check will clear.
:\/:
If the victim confirms their willingness to do so, the attackers reveal the identity of their authorized supplier, which turns out to be an individual with a Venmo or Zelle account, two US money transfer services. The bogus recruitment scheme is designed to get the jobseeker to send to this unknown party a sum equal to the cost of a MacBook and other “required software and equipment” — more than US$3,500 in total.
:\/:
The scheme is big enough for the implicated companies to draw attention to it. ArtStation, for its part, posted an in-depth 
:\/:
 about the scam. Some game developers and publishers have also posted warnings on their websites for potential candidates.
:\/:
Be wary of offers to discuss a job or hold an interview in secret chats, in which messages are encrypted and cannot be forwarded, and which alert participants if anyone takes a screenshot.
:\/:
Check contact information on companies’ official websites, which usually provide addresses and communication channels for HR personnel. If necessary, e-mail a general inquiry to the company asking if the person who contacted you actually works there.
:\/:
There’s a certain reliability to everyday objects. Take a TV remote for example: It’s hard to imagine one eavesdropping on conversations, but cybersecurity researchers J. J. Lehman and Ofri Ziv from Israeli company Guardicore got one to do just that. They reported their findings at 
:\/:
 was the remote control for the Comcast Xfinity X1 set-top box, which is popular in the United States (with more than 10 million users, according to the researchers). The remote control supports voice commands, for which it is equipped with a microphone and a quite capable processor.
:\/:
Two data transfer technologies are implemented in the device. For switching channels and other simple actions, a standard infrared transmitter is used, which has the important advantage of consuming minimal energy so that the remote does not need frequent charging, allowing it to operate on ordinary batteries for an extended period of time.
:\/:
But for cases requiring a faster data transfer speed, the remote uses a radio interface, enabling the remote not only to send data to the set-top box, but to receive from it as well. The radio interface consumes more power, so it is used only when needed.
:\/:
Like many modern devices, this type of remote control is essentially a connected computer — and therefore hackable.
:\/:
Having studied the remote’s firmware (with a copy conveniently stored on the set-top box’s hard drive), the researchers were able to determine the alterations that would enable the firmware to command the remote control to turn on the microphone and transmit sound over the radio channel.
:\/:
But modifying the firmware was not enough; they still needed a way to upload it to the remote, and preferably without physical contact. To do that, Lehman and Ziv examined how the set-top box communicates with the remote and updates its software.
:\/:
They discovered that the remote had to initiate the update process. Every 24 hours, the remote queries the set-top box and receives either a negative response or an offer to install a new version of the software, which it downloads from the set-top-box.
:\/:
The researchers also found several vital flaws in the communication mechanism between the remote and the Xfinity box. First, the former does not check the firmware’s authenticity, so it will download and install whatever firmware the set-top box (or the hacker’s computer impersonating one) offers it.
:\/:
Second, although the set-top box and the remote exchange encrypted messages, the encryption is not properly enforced. The remote accepts (and executes) commands sent in plain text marked “encryption disabled.” The remote’s requests are still encrypted and therefore cannot be deciphered, but simply understanding the communication mechanism makes it possible to effectively guess what the remote is asking and to give the right response.
:\/:
Third, it is quite easy to trigger an error in the firmware module that handles communication with the remote, causing the module to crash and reboot. That gives the attacker a window during which they are guaranteed to be the only party giving commands to the remote.
:\/:
Knock out the set-top box module responsible for communicating with the remote the moment it makes an update query;
:\/:
The researchers stuffed their remote with modified firmware that queried for updates not every 24 hours, but every minute; then, on receiving certain response, turned on the built-in microphone and broadcast the sound to the attackers. Their tests succeeded at relatively long range and through a wall, simulating a wiretap van outside a house.
:\/:
In our opinion, there is little point worrying about your remote being hacked and turned into a listening device. Although proven feasible, the attack isn’t really practical. It might be suitable for a targeted attack on some kind of special person, but it’s too complex and time-consuming for large-scale use. That said, here are some tips for those of a you-can-never-be-too-cautious frame of mind:
:\/:
If you own an Xfinity TV box, check the remote’s firmware version. The researchers responsibly disclosed the vulnerabilities to Comcast, and the company has issued an update that fixes the problem;
:\/:
The remote controls of some other manufacturer’s TV boxes and TVs with voice support likely operate on the same principle and may have similar vulnerabilities. So periodically check for updates for your remote and install them when they are available. Corresponding items in TV and set-top-box menus are likely somewhere near their Wi-Fi and Bluetooth settings;
:\/:
Consider taking apart the remote to physically remove the microphone if your remote supports voice commands but you never use them. We think doing so is overkill, but it’s an option;
:\/:
Be aware that an attack on your Wi-Fi network is far more probable than such an exotic hack. Make sure to

 an attack by ransomware on the Health Service Executive (HSE), Ireland’s healthcare system. The HSE decided to shut down key information systems for thorough investigation and protection against further threat spread. A number of clinics have reported temporary shutdowns or at least disruptions in their operations, although they continue to provide emergency care services. The COVID-19 vaccination program was not interrupted, although some institutions have had to revert to outdated workflow systems.
:\/:
According to HSE representatives, a “very sophisticated,” human-operated ransomware attack caused “significant disruption” to their services. Such incidents are particularly difficult to counter because the cybercriminals adjust their tactics and specific targets during the attack.
:\/:
External experts and law enforcement cyberspecialists are contributing to the investigation, which is still in early stages. However, HSE representatives presume the main target was data stored on the organization’s servers.
:\/:
 the unified HSE patient registering system may have been a spreading vector. Fortunately, the attack did not affect life-saving equipment; only healthcare records are unavailable.
:\/:
 contacted HSE representatives and demanded almost $20 million in ransom. The crooks claimed that they had been present in HSE’s network for more than two weeks before encrypting any data, that they’d downloaded approximately 700GB of unencrypted files — including personal data, contracts, and financial documents — and that they’d publish the information if their terms weren’t met.
:\/:
. To minimize infection risk, we recommend prioritizing the protection of remote access tools and e-mail systems, the 
:\/:
–class solutions can help detect ransomware threats in their early stages, simplifying response actions and investigation.
:\/:
The phenomenon has raked in massive sums, as evidenced by its search popularity. So, what is smishing?
:\/:
Smishing is phishing spread through text (SMS) messages rather than by e-mail; hence the term: smishing = SMS + phishing. Some classifications include phishing over messaging apps as part of smishing, but we consider that a separate category and won’t be discussing it here.
:\/:
The goal, as with any other phishing attempt, is to trick recipients into divulging sensitive information, typically their online banking password or bank card information. To do that, scammers send text messages, generally about an invented problem — a delivery issue, unpaid bill, or blocked account, for example — that the recipient has to resolve by clicking on a link. After that, things can go one of two ways:
:\/:
Scenario 1 infects the victim with malware disguised as a legitimate application but whose actual purpose is to request important information;
:\/:
Scenario 2 takes the victim to a Web page disguised as a legitimate website but whose actual purpose is to request important information.
:\/:
The choice of scenario really depends on the scammer’s comfort zone — malware or fake websites. The victim’s outcome is the same either way. Similar scams have resulted in the theft of thousands of 
:\/:
. Why has SMS phishing become so popular recently, and what makes it more dangerous than typical phishing?
:\/:
Most of us have more or less gotten used to e-mail phishing, and people by and large know how to recognize and avoid it. Text messages are a more unexpected channel for scams, so people are less likely to think a short message will represent a scam.
:\/:
Beyond that, although people trust text messages more, texts tend to be less secure than e-mail. Nowadays, every halfway decent e-mail service has an intelligent built-in spam filter. The filters aren’t perfect, but scammers need to keep inventing 
:\/:
 to get past them. Unfortunately, when it comes to flexibility and accuracy, mobile operators’ spam filters leave something to be desired.
:\/:
People also typically read their text messages on the go or between other tasks. That, combined with a lowered expectation of danger in text messages, means they tend to look less closely at text messages, making an attack more likely to succeed. In other words, when people get a message, they’re likely to disregard their mental checklist of warning signs and just click through.
:\/:
Finally, SMS messages display fewer signs that would help you recognize a scam. When you get an e-mail, you can look at the sender’s address, assess design and layout, and consider how plausible the message is overall — in short, you can look for standard red flags.
:\/:
With texts, even legitimate messages look a lot like one another, with short messages often employing nonstandard language and no design to speak of; and scammers with the technical skills can realistically 
:\/:
Do not click on links or share any of your information in a text thread. As a general rule, the less activity, the better;
:\/:
Use two-factor authentication wherever you have the option. That way, even having a stolen password won’t help criminals raid your account. 
:\/:
Contact your bank immediately if you suspect criminals have gotten access to your account. The bank can freeze your card, change your passwords, and advise you about further steps.
:\/:
Do not do that. Responding simply confirms that your phone number is active. Unsubscribing can be hard even with legitimate companies; don’t expect a fair deal from people breaking the law.
:\/:
If you have any doubts, contact your bank directly. It’s unlikely they sent that message, but speaking of contacting the bank, make sure to get that phone number from an official source, such as its website. Whatever you do, don’t use any contact details from the suspicious text.
:\/:
Of course there is! Many security solutions have long used built-in filters to catch suspicious links in text messages and messaging apps, warn you about them, and make sure you don’t lose money just because you let your guard down for a moment. For example, you’ll benefit from such filters in 
:\/:
 from being a threat to individual computers to posing a serious danger to corporate networks. Cybercriminals have stopped simply trying to infect as many computers as possible and are now targeting big victims instead. Attacks on commercial organizations and government agencies require careful planning but can potentially lead to rewards in the tens of millions of dollars.
:\/:
Ransomware gangs exploit companies’ financial clout, which tends to be far greater than that of ordinary users. What’s more, many modern ransomware groups steal data prior to encryption, adding the threat of publication as further leverage. For the affected company, that adds all kinds of risks, from reputational damage to problems with shareholders to fines from regulators, which often add up to more than the ransom.
:\/:
According to our data, 2016 was a watershed year. In just a few months, the number of ransomware cyberattacks on organizations

: Whereas in January 2016 we recorded one incident every 2 minutes on average, by late September the interval had shrunk to 40 seconds.
:\/:
Since 2019, experts have regularly observed targeted campaigns from a series of so-called big-game-hunting ransomware. The malware operators’ own sites show attack statistics. We used this data to compile a ranking of the most active cybercriminal groups.
:\/:
, quickly rose to the top of its malware class. Of the total number of victims, this ransomware accounted for more than a third of attacks. The group behind Maze was one of the first to 
:\/:
. If the victim refused to pay the ransom, the cybercriminals threatened to publish the stolen files. The technique proved effective and was later adopted by many other ransomware operations, including REvil and DoppelPaymer, which we discuss below.
:\/:
In another innovation, the cybercriminals began reporting their attacks to the media. In late 2019, the Maze group told Bleeping Computer about its 
:\/:
, attaching a few of the stolen files as evidence. In its e-mail conversations with the website’s editors, the group threatened to send spam from Allied Universal’s servers, and it later published the hacked company’s confidential data on the Bleeping Computer forum.
:\/:
, although not before several international corporations, a state bank in Latin America, and a US city’s information system had already suffered from its activities. In each of those cases, Maze operators demanded several million dollars from the victims.
:\/:
Conti appeared in late 2019 and was very active throughout 2020, accounting for more than 13% of all ransomware victims during this period. Its creators remain active.
:\/:
An interesting detail about Conti attacks is that the cybercriminals offer the target company help with security in exchange for agreeing to pay, 
:\/:
 “You will get instructions how to close the hole in security and how to avoid such problems in the future + we will recommend you special software that makes the most problems to hackers.”
:\/:
As with Maze, the ransomware not only encrypts, but also sends copies of files from hacked systems to ransomware operators. The cybercriminals then threaten to publish the information online if the victim fails to comply with their demands. Among the most high-profile Conti attacks was the

In the total statistics, REvil victims make up 11%. The malware affected almost 20 business sectors. The largest share of victims falls to Engineering & Manufacturing (30%), followed by Finance (14%), Professional & Consumer Services (9%), Legal (7%), and IT & Telecommunications (7%). The latter category accounted for one of the most high-profile ransomware attacks of 2019, when cybercriminals

Every targeted attack on a large company is the result of a long process of finding vulnerabilities in the infrastructure, devising a scenario, and selecting tools. Then the penetration occurs, spreading malware throughout the corporate infrastructure. Cybercriminals sometimes remain inside a corporate network for several months before encrypting files and issuing a demand.

Rising cryptocurrency prices have led to an increase in demand for mining equipment, but COVID-19 restrictions have led to a drop in supply. As a result, the world is witnessing 
:\/:
, with months-long wait times for new deliveries. Cybercriminals, as always, are looking to capitalize on the crisis.
:\/:
For example, fraudsters have been extracting cryptocurrency from buyers using a popular Google service and a clone of a mining equipment manufacturer’s website.
:\/:
 (Forms, Sheets, Calendar, Photos and others) for their ability to send automatic notifications to anyone the author of a file (or a calendar entry, etc.) shares it with or mentions in it. The e-mails come not from the actual author, but from no less an authority than Google, so spam filters typically let them through.
:\/:
In this case, potential cryptocurrency miners are receiving e-mails saying they have been mentioned in a Google Docs file by a user with the nickname BitmainTech (the name of a real manufacturer of mining rigs). The respectable name — @docs[.]google[.]com — in the From field helps lower the recipient’s guard. The displayed username is whatever the sender wants it to be, and the sender’s real e-mail address remains hidden.
:\/:
Bait follows in the form of an announcement of a sale on Antminer S19j mining machines. Posing as the Bitmain sales department, the scammers report that the equipment is available to be ordered, but time’s running out; stock is limited and delivery is on a first-come-first-served basis. The text is replete with trust-inspiring facts and figures.
:\/:
The same text appears in the Google Docs file, only with an active link that leads, through a chain of redirects, to bitmain[.]sa[.]com, a clone of the official bitmain[.]com website (note the differences in the address). A WHOIS check reveals that the domain of the fake site was 
:\/:
For extra credibility, the cybercriminals use the HTTPS protocol. Readers of this blog already know HTTPS protects data from interception as it travels from user to site but does not guarantee a site is bona fide. If the destination site is malicious, using a secure protocol just means the data will travel securely to the cybercriminals.
:\/:
On the real Bitmain website, at the time of posting, the Buy button was inactive because the last Antminer S19j batch had already been snapped up; the site does not expect new deliveries to occur before October. But on the fake resource, the coveted mining machine slides right into the shopping cart, and for the same price as the real one, $5,017.
:\/:
To proceed to checkout, the victim has to sign in or register. There are two possible reasons to implement this requirement: for greater authenticity or to build a database of addresses and passwords for account hacking purposes. Despite registering (using a disposable e-mail address, of course), we never received a registration confirmation message.
:\/:
In any event, the system allows the user to sign in and finalize the order. The login procedure looks quite convincing.
:\/:
At the next stage, the victim is asked to provide a delivery address. Perhaps the scammers are collecting this data for sale as well.
:\/:
A warning that the manufacturer cannot ship to mainland China if the order is placed on the English-language site
:\/:
Most cryptomining rig manufacturers, including Bitmain, are located in China. Moving heavy and expensive equipment from there is not cheap, yet the cybercriminals charge roughly five dollars for shipping, regardless of destination and service (UPS, DHL, or FedEx).
:\/:
Next, the victim is asked to choose a payment method. They must use cryptocurrency but can choose BTC, BCH, ETH, or LTC.
:\/:
The final and most important step is making the payment. The cybercriminals provide cryptowallet details and warn that the transaction must be completed within two hours, otherwise the order will be canceled. Note that the cost of delivery, though minuscule, does not appear in the bill.
:\/:
After the victim has parted with a considerable amount of cryptocurrency, the air of legitimacy evaporates. The user’s personal account contains no order data, and the buttons are inactive.
:\/:
Stay wary, and pay particular attention if someone tries to hurry you into making a payment. In this case, the appearance of a scarce product for sale is no different than receiving news of a sudden lottery win (doubly suspicious if you didn’t even buy a ticket).
:\/:
Check the official website. If you receive an offer from a well-known brand, find the official website and look there for information about the promotion. Always examine the address bar.

 a zero-day vulnerability (CVE-2021-28310) in a Microsoft Windows component called Desktop Window Manager (DWM). We believe several threat actors have already exploited the vulnerability. Microsoft just released the patch, and we suggest applying it immediately. Here’s why.
:\/:
Pretty much everyone is familiar with the windowed interface of modern operating systems:  each program opening in a separate window that doesn’t necessarily take up the whole screen. Windows may overlap, for example, one casting a shadow over others as if it were physically blocking the light. In Microsoft Windows, the component responsible for rendering features such as shadows and transparency is Desktop Window Manager.
:\/:
To understand why Desktop Window Manager is important in a cybersecurity context, consider that programs don’t just draw their windows on the screen; they put the necessary information in a buffer. Desktop Window Manager grabs that information from each program’s buffer and creates the overall composite view that the user sees. When a user moves one window over another, the open programs don’t know anything about whether their windows should be casting a shadow or having a shadow cast on them, for example. Desktop Window Manager does that job, and as such it is a key service in Windows that has existed in every version of Windows since Vista — and cannot be deactivated in Windows 8 or later versions.
:\/:
 vulnerability. That means a program can trick Desktop Window Manager into giving it access that it shouldn’t have. In this case, the vulnerability allowed the attackers to execute arbitrary code on victims’ machines — it essentially gave them full control over the computers.
