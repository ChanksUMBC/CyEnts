Sounds pretty sweet, doesn’t it? The computer is on all the time anyway, and you have unlimited Internet access, so why not? It’s not even your own resources, just corporate equipment and bandwidth. That all sounds simple, but you don’t have to look too closely to see that when you agree to install a proxyware client on a work computer, it’s not harmless at all. Install proxyware and you’re exposing your corporate network to risks that far outweigh any income you might earn from the deal. To put it bluntly, no other questionable Internet money-making scheme comes with such a variety of undesirable consequences. Today we explain why proxyware is dangerous. What is proxyware? Researchers at Cisco Talos coined the term proxyware and have reported on the phenomenon in depth . Essentially, a proxyware service acts as a proxy server. Installed on a desktop computer or smartphone, it makes the device’s Internet connection accessible to an outside party. Depending on how long the program remains enabled and how much bandwidth it is permitted to use, the client accumulates points that can eventually be converted into currency and transferred to a bank account. Of course, these kinds of services do not have to be used for illegal purposes, and they do have some legitimate applications. For example, some appeal to the marketing departments of large companies, which need as many Web entry points as possible in different geographic regions. Why proxyware on a company computer is a bad idea Although proxyware services claim “tenants” are harmless, problems sometimes still occur, including IP address reputation damage and software reliability. Pessimization of the IP address The most common problem with proxyware for the users of the computers on which it runs — or even for the entire network if it has a single IP address — is that the services often encounter CAPTCHA s, whose entire point is to ensure only real humans can get access to an online resource. A computer with proxyware raises suspicions, and rightly so. One way bandwidth tenants can use proxyware-laden computers is to scan the Web or measure the speed of website access by regularly deploying a flood of requests. Automatic DDoS protection systems do not like that. It can also be a sign of something even more shady, such as spam mailings. Keep in mind that the consequences can be much more dire for the company, with automated requests landing the organization’s IP address on a list of unsafe addresses. So, for example, if the e-mail server operates on the same address, at some point the employees’ messages may stop reaching external recipients. Other e-mail servers will simply start blocking the organization’s IP address and domain. Fake proxyware clients Another risk employees take in installing proxyware is that they may download something they didn’t mean to. Try this little experiment: Go to Google and search for “honeygain download.” You’ll get a couple of links to the developer’s official website and hundreds to unscrupulous file-sharing sites, half of which include “bonus content” with their downloads. What kinds of bonus content? Well, researchers describe one such trojanized installer as deploying a cryptocurrency-mining program (which devour a PC’s resources and electricity) and a tool to connect to the cybercriminals’ command server, from which anything else can be downloaded at any time. That kind of proxyware can take down an organization’s entire IT infrastructure. It could also lead to ransomware encrypting data, ransom demands, and more. In sum, proxyware is a grab bag of dangers for a business. Covert installation of proxyware Most scenarios resemble the above: unintended consequences of purposeful (if sometimes unauthorized) installations. The converse sometimes happens as well, with an employee catching actual malware on a shady site, and that malware installing a modified proxyware client on the computer. That’s nothing but trouble: slowed computers, less network bandwidth, and, potentially, data theft. Recommendations for businesses Your best way to combat criminal exploitation through proxyware is to install a reliable antivirus solution on every computer that has Internet access. Not only will that protect your company from the harmful effects of proxyware, but if said proxyware includes, or is included with, other malware, you’ll still be covered. To be clear, even “clean” proxyware is not much better. A sound security policy should not allow anyone to install proxyware or any other questionable software on employees’ computers, regardless of whether the computers are in the office or employees are connecting to the organization’s VPN. As a rule, most employees do not need, and should not be allowed, to install software on their computers independently."}}

But when searching for the latest megahit, don’t neglect basic security measures or you might find that someone else is enjoying it at your expense — or worse, that the money in your bank account has evaporated. It’s more fun to ponder what to watch next than to dig through security settings, but attackers are ready and waiting to siphon off your personal and payment information. Phishing bait Streaming services offer a variety of payment plans, but generally they all involve paying with a credit card. And where there are card details, there is phishing. What’s more, newbies and seasoned account holders may experience different forms of bait. We collected some examples from users who agreed to share threat information. “Subscribe now!” To sign up for a streaming service, you need a valid e-mail address; and to pay, you need some form of online payment such as a credit card or PayPal account. (If you plan to watch Apple TV, you’ll also need an Apple ID.) Unsurprisingly, cybercriminals have created fake sign-up pages to net all of those goodies in one go. Armed with your info, they can withdraw or spend your money right away; your e-mail address should come in handy for future attacks. In the example below, the fake site is not very convincing. Can you spot the phishing signs ? Fake Netflix sign-up page “Refresh data” If you already have a paid subscription, then attackers will threaten to block it, assuming, logically, that you value it. Here’s an e-mail from “friends at Netflix,” telling the recipient to update or confirm payment details or they’ll close the account. And it includes a big, red button. Don’t rush to click that — remember what happens in the movies when they push the big, red button? “Dear costumer, please update your account” The link takes you to a payment confirmation page. Now, many phishing messages contain such obvious mistakes as addressing “costumers,” but take the form below as an example that actually looks plausible. It has no spelling mistakes or weird design elements, but the inattentive user who falls for it could lose money from their bank account. Fake Netflix website prompts to enter personal and banking data, allegedly for account reactivation A dangerous premiere In the example below, cybercriminals used popular shows to attract fans who didn’t have subscriptions, offering them the opportunity to watch the shows on the fake website. This unofficial page invites fans to watch or download The Mandalorian As a teaser, they show a short clip, which they sometimes try to pass off as a new, previously unaired episode. More often than not, it is cut from trailers that have long been in the public domain. Intrigued victims are then asked to buy a low-cost subscription to continue watching. What follows is a classic scenario: Any payment details users enter go straight to the crooks, and the never-before-seen episode remains such. No longer your account Cybercriminals are interested in more than bank account details; account credentials for streaming services are also hot. Because hijacked accounts with paid subscriptions get put up for sale on the dark web , you could log in one day and discover someone else is already there. After all, depending on your Netflix plan, you can stream on 1–4 devices simultaneously, and cybercriminals can sell your login credentials to any number of streamers. That means you might find yourself having to wait in line until some stranger decides to sign out. This fake Netflix login page looks just like the real one That may not be the end of it, either: Many people use the same password for different accounts , and databases of stolen passwords die hard. If their password is the same everywhere, the victim need only enter it on a phishing page once. Buy a subscription for yourself, not cybercriminals Cybercriminals scam movie and TV show lovers in different ways. Some of their ruses are quite easy to spot, others less so. By following simple digital security rules, you can protect your data not only in online movie theaters, but elsewhere as well. Do not click links in e-mails, even if a message seems to be from a real streaming (or other) service; always go to the official website by entering the address manually or through the app; Do not trust any person or site promising viewings of movies or shows before the official premiere; Pay attention to red flags that warn of phishing e-mails or fake websites; Stay alert and read more about scams and phishing schemes to learn how to sense which e-mails and websites are trustworthy, and which you should avoid; Use different passwords for all accounts that you value, and use a password manager to remember them for you; Use a reliable security solution that identifies malicious attachments and blocks phishing websites."}}

We think that’s great! We even periodically offer advice on how to cut down on digital noise . But LinkedIn is a special case. People really do expect messages from the social network for professionals — one could be from a prospective employer or business partner, after all. But a message from LinkedIn might just as easily come from a scammer pretending to represent a legitimate company. In this post, we’re taking apart some phishing e-mails masquerading as LinkedIn notifications. “I am a bussinessman and am interested in doing business with you” On the face of it, this type of e-mail looks like a typical partnership proposal. It includes the photo, position, and company name of the potential “partner,” and even a LinkedIn logo. The message is too short, though, and one might expect the word “businessman” to be spelled correctly in a legitimate message. You may also see that the message came from “LinkediinContact” — note the extra “i” — and the sender’s address has nothing to do with LinkedIn. E-mail purportedly from LinkedIn proposing cooperation with an Arab businessman The link in the e-mail leads to a website that looks similar to the real LinkedIn login page. Phishing LinkedIn login page But the URL is far removed from LinkedIn’s, and the domain is the Turkish .tr, not .com. If the victim enters their credentials on this site, the account will soon be in the hands of the scammers. “Please send me a qoute” A similar case is this message seemingly from an importer in Beijing, asking for a quote for the delivery of goods. The notification looks convincing; the message footer includes links to view help and unsubscribe from notifications, a copyright notice, and even the actual postal address of LinkedIn’s China office. Even the sender’s address looks like the real deal. Nevertheless, we see some red flags. E-mail purportedly from LinkedIn in which a Chinese buyer requests a quote. The sender’s address looks clean, but that doesn’t mean everything’s in order For example, an article is missing in front of the word “message” in the subject line. The author may not speak fluent English, but the platform generates the subject of LinkedIn notifications automatically, so the subject can’t contain errors. If you smell a rat and do a search for the company (UVLEID), you won’t find it because it doesn’t exist. And most important, the links in the e-mail point to a suspicious address in which random words, numbers and letters have been added to the name of the social network. The domain is again wrong, as well. This time it’s .app, which app developers use. The button points to a phishing site The “LinkedIn login page,” which the link opens, has issues: a blue square covering part of the last letter in the logo, and Linkedin instead of LinkedIn (under the username and password fields). arefully check the URL of the site and the name of the social network “You appeared in 2 search this week” Links in fake notifications don’t always open fake login pages — sometimes they can lead to more unexpected places. For example, this message saying that the recipient’s profile has been viewed twice — common information for LinkedIn users to see — obviously uses bad English, but even if you miss that, a few other details should catch your attention: Unknown sender address and link to a site in a Brazilian domain With this kind of deception, if the victim misses the strange set of letters in the sender’s address or the Brazilian domain, they may well click the button and get to an unexpected site — in our case, a “how to become a millionaire” online survey. After a few redirects, we ended up at a form asking for contact information, including phone numbers. The scammers most likely use the collected numbers for phone fraud . Online survey with redirect for further data harvesting How to tell if a message from a potential partner or employer is fake Cybercriminals use phishing to steal accounts, personal data, and money, but that is no reason to stop using LinkedIn or other services. Instead, learn how to guard against phishing , and always keep these basic tips at the ready: Watch out for unexpected messages from well-known companies; Look for inconsistencies in the names and addresses of senders, as well as typos in links, the subject line, and the e-mail body; Check notifications using official apps or websites, and in the latter case, manually type in the address or open it from your bookmarks; Enter contact information, card numbers, or login credentials only after double-checking you are on the real site; Use a reliable security solution that warns you of danger and blocks phishing and fraudulent sites."}}

However, just like any other platform that hosts user-generated content, Discord can be exploited. Discord’s extensive customization options also open the door to attacks on ordinary users, both on and off the chat server. Recent research into Discord security has revealed several cyberattack scenarios linked to its chat service, some of which can be truly dangerous for users. Here’s how to protect yourself. Malware being spread through Discord Malicious files distributed through Discord represent the most obvious threat. A recent study identified several dozen types of malware. We call this threat “obvious” simply because sharing files through Discord is very easy; every file uploaded to the platform is assigned a permanent URL, formatted as follows: cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/{channel ID}/{file ID}/{file name} Most files are freely available for download by anyone with the link. The study describes a real-life attack example: a fake website offering Zoom Web conferencing client downloads. The website looks like the real one, and the malicious file is hosted on a Discord server. That gets around restrictions on downloading files from untrusted sources. The rationale is that the servers of a popular application used by millions are less likely to be blocked by antimalware solutions. The malicious “lifehack” is as obvious as are the means of combating it: High-quality security solutions look at more than just the download source to determine the level of threat a file may pose. Kaspersky tools immediately detect malicious functionality the first time a user tries to download the file, for example, and then, with the help of a cloud-based security system, let all other users know the file should be blocked. All services that permit uploads of user-generated content face issues of misuse. Free Web hosting sites see phishing pages created on them, for example, and file-sharing platforms are used for spreading Trojans. Form-filling services serve as spam channels. The list goes on. Platform owners do try to combat the abuse, but with mixed results. Discord developers also clearly need to implement at least some basic means of user protection. For example, files used on a particular chat server need not be made available to the whole world. Checking and automatically blocking known malware also seems wise. Regardless, this is Discord’s least exotic problem, and combating it is really no different than dealing with any other method of malware distribution. It is not, however, the only threat users face. Malicious bots Another recent study demonstrates how easy it is to exploit Discord’s bot system. The bots extend chat server functionality in various ways, and Discord offers a vast array of options for customizing users’ own chats. One example of chat-related malicious code was recently published on (and fairly quickly removed from) GitHub: Using mainly capabilities provided by the Discord API, the author was able to execute arbitrary code on a user’s computer. It might look something like this: A malicious chatbot launches an arbitrary program on a user’s computer after receiving a command through a Discord chat. Source In one attack scenario, malicious code relies on a locally installed Discord client to launch automatically on startup. Installing a bot from an untrusted source can lead to such an infection. The researchers also looked at another Discord misuse scenario that doesn’t rely on the user having installed a Discord client. In this case, the malware uses the chat service to communicate. Thanks to the public API, uncomplicated registration process, and basic data encryption, a backdoor can easily and conveniently use Discord to send data about the infected system to its operator and, in turn, receive commands to execute code, upload new malicious modules, and more. That kind of scenario appears quite dangerous; it greatly simplifies the work of attackers, who then do not need to create a communication interface with infected computers but can instead use something already available. At the same time, it somewhat complicates the detection of malicious activity; conversations between the backdoor and its operator look like regular user activity in a popular chat. Protection for gamers Although the aforementioned threats apply to all Discord users, they relate mainly to those who use Discord as a game add-in: for voice and text communication, streaming, collecting gaming statistics, and so on. Such use entails substantial customization and adds to users’ risks of finding and installing malicious extensions. The relaxed, seemingly safe environment actually represents further threat, increasing the success rate of social engineering techniques — bait goes down easier in a cozy chat with people you believe are your friends. We recommend following the same digital hygiene rules on Discord as you do elsewhere on the Web: Don’t click suspicious links or download obscure files; scrutinize offers that sound too good to be true; and refrain from sharing any personal or financial information. As for the Trojans and backdoors, Discord-based or simply distributed through the platform, they are not special or essentially different from other kinds of malware. Use a reliable antivirus app to stay safe, keep it running at all times — including when you install any software or add bots to a chat server — and pay attention to its warnings. Performance need not be a concern. For example, our security products include a game mode that minimizes overhead without compromising protection."}}

Found mostly on home computers back then, its primary task was to steal login credentials for online banking services. In recent years, however, its creators have actively transformed the banking Trojan into a multifunctional modular tool. What’s more, Trickbot is now popular with cybercriminal groups as a delivery vehicle for injecting third-party malware into corporate infrastructure. News outlets recently reported that Trickbot’s authors have hooked up with various new partners to use the malware to infect corporate infrastructure with all kinds of additional threats, such as the Conti ransomware. Such repurposing could pose an additional danger to employees of corporate security operation centers and other cybersec experts. Some security solutions still recognize Trickbot as a banking Trojan, as per its original specialty. Therefore, infosec officers who detect it might view it as a random home-user threat that accidentally slipped into the corporate network. In fact, its presence there could indicate something far more serious — a ransomware injection attempt or even part of a targeted cyberespionage operation. Our experts were able to download modules of the Trojan from one of its C&C servers and analyze them thoroughly. What Trickbot can do now The modern Trickbot’s main objective is to penetrate and spread on local networks. Its operators can then use it for various tasks — from reselling access to the corporate infrastructure to third-party attackers, to stealing sensitive data. Here’s what the malware can now do: Harvest usernames, password hashes and other information useful for lateral movement in the network from Active Directory and the registry; Intercept web traffic on the infected computer; Provide remote device control via the VNC protocol; Steal cookies from browsers; Extract login credentials from the registry, the databases of various applications and configuration files, as well as steal private keys, SSL certificates and data files for cryptocurrency wallets; Intercept autofill data from browsers and information that users input into forms on web-sites; Scan files on FTP and SFTP servers; Embed malicious scripts in web pages; Redirect browser traffic through a local proxy; Hijack APIs responsible for certificate chain verification so as to spoof the verification results; Collect Outlook profile credentials, intercept e-mails in Outlook and send spam through it; Search for the OWA service and brute-force it; Gain low-level access to hardware; Provide access to the computer at the hardware level; Scan domains for vulnerabilities; Find addresses of SQL servers and execute search queries on them; Spread through the EternalRomance and EternalBlue exploits; Create VPN connections. A detailed description of the modules and indicators of compromise can be found in our Securelist post . How to guard against the Trickbot Trojan The statistics show that the majority of Trickbot detections this year were registered in the US, Australia, China, Mexico and France. This does not mean, however, that other regions are safe, especially considering the readiness of its creators to collaborate with other cybercriminals. To prevent your company from falling victim to this Trojan, we recommend that you equip all Internet-facing devices with a high-quality security solution . In addition, it’s a good idea to use cyberthreat monitoring services to detect suspicious activity in the company’s infrastructure."}}
{"https://www.kaspersky.co.in/blog/dangerous-feature-phones/23496/": {"metadata": {"dateAccessed": "2021-11-21", "dateCreated": "2021-10-15", "source": "www.kaspersky.co.in"}, "text": "A recent review of five entry-level mobile phones retailing for about $10–$20 examined their security in detail . Commonly referred to as “feature phones” or “granny phones” — and often procured for elderly relatives either unwilling or unable to get used to smartphones — such phones can also be “just in case” spares. Some people also believe they are safer than Android-powered smartphones. Well, the reviewer refuted that last bit. He discovered hidden functions in four out of the five phones: Two transmit data at first power up (leaking the new owner’s personal information), and the other two not only leak private data, but can also subscribe the user to paid content by secretly communicating over the Internet with a command server. Infected granny phones The study author offers information about the methods used to analyze these simple devices’ firmware, the technicalities of which may be interesting to those willing to repeat the same analysis. However, let’s get straight to the findings. Out of the five phones, two send the user’s data somewhere the first time they’re powered on. To whom the data goes — manufacturer, distributor, firmware developer, or somebody else — is not clear. Neither is it clear how the data may be used. It could be assumed that such data might be useful to monitor sales or control the distribution of batches of products in different countries. To be clear, it doesn’t sound very dangerous; and after all, every smartphone transmits some telemetry data. Remember, however, that all major smartphone manufacturers at least try to anonymize the data they collect, and its destination is usually more or less clear. In this case, however, nothing is known about who is collecting owners’ sensitive information without their consent. For example, one of the phones transmits not only its serial number, country of activation, firmware info, and language, but also the base station identifier, handy for establishing the user’s approximate location. Moreover, the server collecting the data has no protection whatsoever, so the information is basically up for grabs. One more subtlety: The transmission takes place over the Internet. To be clear, a feature phone user may not even be aware that the device can go online. So, apart from anything else, the covert actions may result in surprise mobile traffic charges. Another phone from the review group, apart from leaking user data, was programmed to steal money from its owner. According to firmware analysis, the phone contacted the command server over the Internet and executed its instructions, including sending hidden text messages to paid numbers. The next phone model had even more advanced malicious functionality. According to one actual phone user, a total stranger used the phone number to sign up for Telegram. How could that have happened? Signing up for almost any messaging app means providing a phone number to which a confirmation code is sent by SMS. It seems, however, the phone can intercept this message and forward the confirmation code to a C&C server, all the while concealing the activity from the owner. Whereas the previous examples involved little more than unforeseen expense, this scenario threatens real legal problems, for example should the account be used for any criminal activities. What should I do now that I know push-button phones are unsafe? The difference between modern low-end phones and their counterparts of 10 years ago is that now, even dirt-cheap circuitry can include Internet access. Even with an otherwise clean device, this may prove an unpleasant discovery: a phone chosen specifically for its inability to connect to the Internet goes online anyway. Earlier, the same researcher analyzed another push-button phone . Although he found no malicious functionality, the device had a menu of paid subscriptions for horoscopes and demo games, the full versions of which the user could unlock — and pay for — with a text. In other words, your elderly relative or child could press the wrong button on a phone purchased specifically for its lack of Internet and apps and end up paying for the mistake. What makes this “infected” mobiles story important is that it’s often the manufacturer or a dealer back in China adding the “extra features,” so local distributors may not even be aware of the problem. Another complicating factor is that push-button phones come in small batches in a multitude of different models, and it is hard to tell a normal phone from a compromised one, unless one can thoroughly investigate firmware. Clearly, not all distributors can afford adequate firmware control. It might be easier just to buy a smartphone. Of course, that depends on budget, and unfortunately, cheaper smartphones may have similar malware issues . But if you can afford one — even a very simple one — from a major manufacturer, it could prove a safer choice, especially if your reason for choosing a push-button device is that you’re looking for something simple, reliable, and free of hidden functions. You can mitigate Android risks with a reliable antivirus app ; feature phones offer no such control. As for elderly relatives, if they’re used to answering calls by opening their flip phone, adapting to a touch screen may prove next to impossible, but upgrading is worth a try in our opinion. Plenty of older folks have switched to smartphones easily enough and can now happily experience the wide world of mobile computing."}}

You can read more about their findings in Securelist’s post . In this article, meanwhile, we explore what kind of malware FinSpy is and how you can protect yourself from it. What is FinSpy (FinFisher)? A commercial spyware program used by law enforcement and government agencies worldwide, FinSpy first lit up researchers’ radar in 2011, when documents related to it appeared on WikiLeaks. Source code appeared online in 2014, but FinSpy’s story didn’t end there: After a redevelopment and to this day, the malware continues to infect devices around the world. FinSpy is versatile, with versions for computers running Windows, macOS, and Linux, as well as mobile devices with Android and iOS . Its capabilities vary depending on the platform, but in all cases the malware employs various means to transmit bundles of data about them covertly to its handlers. How FinSpy spreads The spyware has several ways to infiltrate Windows machines. For example, it can hide in infected distribution packages including installers for TeamViewer, VLC Media Player, WinRAR, and others. Downloading and running the modified application sets in motion a multistep infection chain . Additionally, our researchers found the malware loader in components that load before the operating system: UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface, the interface through which the operating system communicates with the hardware) and MBR (Master Boot Record, needed to start Windows). Either way, simply booting up the computer installs FinSpy. A smartphone or tablet can pick up FinSpy through a link in a text message. In some cases (for example, if the victim’s iPhone is not jailbroken ), the attacker may need physical access to the device, which somewhat complicates the task. Also, it seems that physical access is necessary for the attackers to infect Linux machines, but we cannot say for sure. What data does FinSpy steal? FinSpy has extensive user-surveillance capabilities. For example, PC versions of the malware can: Turn on the microphone and record or transmit everything it hears; Record or transmit in real time everything the user types on the keyboard; Turn on the camera and record or transmit images from it; Steal files the user interacts with: accesses, modifies, prints, receives, deletes, and so forth; Take screenshots or capture a section of the screen the user clicks; Steal e-mails from the Thunderbird, Outlook, Apple Mail, and Icedove clients; Intercept contacts, chats, calls, and files in Skype. In addition, the Windows version of FinSpy can eavesdrop on VoIP calls, intercept certificates and encryption keys for certain protocols, and download and run forensic data collection tools. On top of all that, the Windows version of FinSpy can infect BlackBerry smartphones, so even that now-exotic platform is not overlooked. As for the mobile versions of FinSpy , they can listen and record calls (voice or VoIP), read text messages, and monitor user activity in instant messaging apps such as WhatsApp, WeChat, Viber, Skype, Line, Telegram, Signal, and Threema. The mobile spyware also sends the operators a list of the victim’s contacts, calls, calendar events, geolocation data, and much more. How to avoid FinSpy Unfortunately, it is not easy to protect yourself completely from government-level spyware. That said, you can take some precautions against FinSpy and other surveillance apps: Download apps only from trusted sources, whether for mobile or desktop or laptop programs. Additionally, Android users should forbid installation from unknown sources to reduce their chances of infection; Stop and think before you click on links in e-mails and messages from strangers. If you must click, first carefully check where the link leads; Don’t jailbreak your smartphone or tablet; Android rooting and iOS jailbreaking make break-ins much easier; Don’t leave devices unattended where strangers have access; Install reliable protection on all of your devices."}}

Google experts consider one of the vulnerabilities as critical and the other two as highly dangerous. What’s worse: according to Google cybercriminals have already exploited two of these three vulnerabilities. Therefore, Google advices all Chrome users to immediately update browser to version 94.0.4606.71. These vulnerabilities are also relevant to other browsers based on the Chromium engine — for instance, Microsoft recommends updating Edge to version 94.0.992.38. Why these vulnerabilities in Google Chrome are dangerous CVE-2021-37974 and CVE-2021-37975 are use-after-free (UAF) class vulnerabilities — they exploit incorrect use of heap memory and, as a result, can lead to arbitrary code execution on the targeted computer. The first one, CVE-2021-37974, is related to the Safe Browsing component, a Google Chrome subsystem that warns users about unsafe websites and downloads. The CVSS v3.1 severity rating for this vulnerability is 7.7 out of 10. The second vulnerability, CVE-2021-37975, was found in Crome’s V8 JavaScript engine. This one is considered the most dangerous of all three — 8.4 on CVSS v3.1 scale, which makes it a ‘critical’ risk vulnerability. Unknown malefactors are already using this vulnerability in their attacks on Chrome users. The cause of the third vulnerability, CVE-2021-37976, is data overexposure caused by the core of Google Chrome. It’s slightly less dangerous — 7.2 on the CVSS v3.1 scale, however it is also already being used by cybercriminals. How cybercriminals can exploit these vulnerabilities Exploitation of all three vulnerabilities requires the creation of a malicious web page. All attackers need is to create a website with an embedded exploit and a way to lure victims to it. As a result, exploits for two use-after-free vulnerabilities allows the attackers to execute arbitrary code on the computers of unpatched Chrome users who have accessed the page. That can lead to the compromise of their system. An exploit for the third vulnerability, CVE-2021-37976, makes it possible for the attackers to gain access to the victim’s confidential information. Google will most likely reveal more details on the vulnerabilities after the majority of users have up-dated their browsers. In any case, it’s not worth delaying the update — much better do it as soon as possible. How to stay safe The first step for everyone is to update browsers on all devices that have access to the Internet. Quite often the update is installed automatically when the browser is restarted, however many users do not restart their computer for a long time, so their browser may remain vulnerable for several days or even weeks. In any case, we recommend checking the version of Chrome. Here’s how to do it: click on the Customise and Control Google Chrome button at the top-right corner of the browser window and choose Help -> About Google Chrome . If your browser version is not the latest available, Chrome will automatically start the update. For extra protection we recommend users to install security solutions on all devices with Internet access. This way, even you’re caught without an up-to-date browser, proactive protection technologies will minimize the possibility of successful vulnerability exploitation. We also recommend employees of corporate information security departments to use security solutions on all devices , monitor security updates and employ automatic update delivery and control system. It would be also reasonable to prioritize the installation of browser updates."}}
{"https://www.kaspersky.co.in/blog/what-is-spookjs/23412/": {"metadata": {"dateAccessed": "2021-11-21", "dateCreated": "2021-09-29", "source": "www.kaspersky.co.in"}, "text": "By comparison, a phishing attack makes sense: Click a link, land on a malicious page, enter some details, and an attacker steals them. Try this one on for size, instead: Click a link and an attacker steals your data. That’s right, today we’re talking about malicious pages that exploit a fundamental CPU feature to steal data without requiring a victim to enter anything. And the vulnerability in question is very difficult, if not impossible, to fix. In 2018, researchers proved the scenario was theoretically possible, unveiling the first two variants of the Spectre vulnerability. Three years later, September 2021 saw the first real-life attack using Spectre v1. Known as Spook.js, the attack concept is complicated, but we will try to strip it down. Spectre v1 background News of the first two attacks of this family — Spectre and Meltdown — broke in 2018 . The attacks exploited the branch prediction mechanism, which is designed to speed up command execution, found in all modern CPUs. When a user enters a password to log in to a website, if the password is correct, one set of instructions is executed. If not, another set is executed. However — and this is where the branch prediction kicks in — before receiving the answer, the CPU starts executing the set of instructions it thinks it will most likely need. In our example, if the password has been entered correctly a hundred times before, the CPU will assume that this time will be no different. If it guesses correctly, the user gets a performance boost. If not, the CPU discards the speculatively executed instructions and runs the other set. In a Spectre-vulnerability attack, an attempt is made to read a data area to which the program does not have access. In the first stage of the attack, multiple calls are made to open-access data areas, whereby the branch prediction system is “trained” to perform the forbidden read operation as well. Using branch prediction, the CPU performs the operation in advance because it is used to the program asking to read data that it is actually allowed to read. But a check reveals that the program is prohibited from accessing the data, so the speculatively executed computations are discarded. So far, so good — but the data read by the CPU is stored for some time in the cache, the CPU’s own memory. Next comes the most interesting part: With no way to read the confidential data from the CPU’s cache directly, the malicious process deploys a so-called side-channel attack to steal it. That involves measuring the speed of access to certain information. If it’s relatively small, that means the data is located in the cache. If large, it is loaded from regular RAM. A set sequence of read attempts results in a leak of the secret information. The result is a fundamental CPU flaw whose only fix is to disable branch prediction completely, thus seriously affecting performance. That said, Specter attacks do have many limitations: The attacker must be able to execute program code on the target computer or mobile device; The attack requires a specific target program coded so as to create the conditions for a successful attack; Even if the attack is successful, data extraction is extremely slow — tens or hundreds of bytes per second — and read errors are far from impossible; In general, stealing the intended secret data, such as passwords, encryption keys, and so forth, requires a combination of conditions. Spook.js — real-life application of Spectre v1 We might conclude that Spectre isn’t all that dangerous. After all, if an attacker can execute code on a target computer, exploiting one of the many vulnerabilities in the operating system or installed programs to escalate privileges and steal data would be far simpler. That is true, but modern Web pages also contain large amounts of program code that gets executed on the user’s computer, in the browser. That’s how Spook.js attacks exploit the Spectre v1 vulnerability: An infected page loads, the browser executes the code, and the cybercriminal steals confidential data. The authors of the report demonstrated some practical attacks. First, they stole a user password from Tumblr. Second, they stole data from Lastpass. Third, they intercepted a user-uploaded image from private storage on a Google server. A feature of the Google Chrome browser made it all possible. Since the release of information about Spectre, Chrome’s developers have taken measures to ward off potential attacks by forcing websites to load in isolation. Because each website creates its own process, malicious code on one page cannot be used to steal data from another resource. But there is one exception: Multiple pages from the same site or domain are grouped together in a common browser process. If the malicious code (written in JavaScript, hence the .js in the name of the attack) is run on one of them, data on other pages can be stolen. Spectre.js attack on Tumblr As a collective blog, Tumblr can host malicious code, at least in theory. That way, with a malicious page open in one tab, if a user tries to log in to their account on the service in another tab, the browser saves and automatically fills in the username and password — which the malicious code can then steal. By exploiting the Spectre vulnerability, an attack can interact tangentially with another tab from the same site and steal data by indirect means. A successful attack using this approach leaves almost no traces. Specter.js attack on LastPass The attack on the LastPass password manager was different in that the code to steal data using Spectre v1 was embedded in a malicious extension for Google Chrome. The LastPass extension was also running in the browser. In some cases, the extensions are also executed in a common browser process, making data theft possible. Specter.js attack on Google Cloud Storage Another example uses attacks on Google cloud storage: One browser tab contains a malicious page hosted on sites.google.com; another lets users upload images to their private storage in the G Suite service. In this scenario, an attacker can use malicious code to gain access to the images. Original image (left) and the one stolen from Google cloud storage using a Spook.js attack. Source Method limitations Researchers have shown how the attack can be carried out on different CPUs, including several modern ones from Intel and even the new ARM-based Apple M1. In all cases, the attack was accomplished in Google Chrome. In principle, several unique features of the browser make Spook.js possible. Other Chromium-based browsers, such as Microsoft Edge, are also vulnerable to this attack. However, there are certain limitations. First is the low speed of data theft (400–600 bytes per second, depending on the CPU), which is why the target file in the last demo is very small. Second is the large number of errors when stealing data from the CPU cache. Up to 4% of the data is erroneous; hence the artifacts in the stolen copy of the image. The attack doesn’t work on AMD processors or in Mozilla Firefox, whose JavaScript engine works differently. The researchers aren’t ruling out the possibility of a successful attack on AMD chips and Firefox browser, but verifying that will require more study. Finally, an attack requires uploading malicious code to a page with the same domain name, such as in the case of collective blogs or hosting. Applying this method to, say, a bank’s website is probably not going to work. No reason to panic The study of Spook.js is important because researchers have, for the first time, been able to demonstrate a fairly realistic scenario for the exploitation of one of the Spectre vulnerabilities. Nevertheless, the chances of a real-world attack are low. First, the developers of Google Chrome, on the back of this research, have beefed up the mechanism for isolating loaded sites from one another. Second, cybercriminals have many easier ways to steal user data, from traditional malware to social engineering, and this one requires serious knowledge of the low-level workings of modern CPUs. As a scientific work, Spook.js is set to alter the software landscape through the introduction of new recommendations for website security (for example, the authors propose moving authorization pages to a separate domain name). Subsequent studies may find ways to make attacks a little easier, but most likely they will lead to more rounds of security enhancements. Even if Spectre-type vulnerabilities can be exploited en masse, the protection means will be the same as for any malware. Security vendors will simply add the new types of attacks to the list of those to be monitored and blocked before execution. It’s also possible that one day researchers will stumble upon a feature of Spectre-like vulnerabilities that necessitates a major reworking of the entire modern IT ecosystem. That, however, remains unlikely. Let’s not forget that it took three years to move from a theoretical vulnerability to the first practical attack (and even then, it’s an attack with many limitations). Spectre may also be used for targeted attacks in which the potential benefit from the stolen data exceeds the costs of the operation. Even if that scenario is relevant to your organization, you can easily make attacks more difficult by using different browsers for different content. For example, do not open pages and Web services with sensitive information in the same browser where you get your online entertainment. Ideally, handle confidential information in an isolated environment, in a virtual machine, or simply on a separate device."}}

The ad states that it steals following data from infected devices: Passwords, cookies , bank card details, browser autofill data; Device data; Screenshots; Desktop and uTorrent client files; Bethesda, Epic Games, GOG, Origin, Steam, Telegram, and VimeWorld client sessions ; Logs. BloodyStealer ad. Source What struck us was that most of the listed programs are game-related, which suggests that gamer accounts and their contents are in demand on the underground market. We decided to examine in detail exactly what risks gamers face. BloodyStealer conquers the world Although BloodyStealer is relatively new, it is already globe-trotting. According to our data, the malware has hit users in Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-Pacific region — not so surprising given its malware-as-a-service (MaaS) distribution model, meaning anyone can buy it and the price is quite low (about $10 per month or roughly $40 for a “lifetime license”). In addition to its theft functions, the malware has a set of tools meant to thwart analysis (read more about them here ). It sends stolen information as a ZIP archive to the C&C server, which is protected against DDoS and other Web attacks. The cybercriminals use either the (quite basic) control panel or Telegram to get the data, including gamer accounts. Not by BloodyStealer alone BloodyStealer is just one of many tools available on the dark web for stealing gamer accounts. Cybercriminals sell other types of malware, many of which have been on the market longer than BloodyStealer. In addition, underground forums often feature ads offering to post a malicious link on a popular website or selling tools to generate phishing pages automatically. Cybercriminal sells BlackMafia phishing tool to create fake PUBG pages With the aid of these tools, cybercriminals can collect, and then try to monetize, a huge amount of credentials. All kinds of offers related to gamer accounts can be found on the dark web. Logs for wholesale access Among the most popular products are so-called logs — databases containing reams of data for logging into accounts. In their ads, attackers can specify the types of data, the geography of users, the period over which the logs were collected, and other details. For example, in the screenshot below, an underground forum member offers an archive with 65,600 records, of which 9,000 are linked to users from the US, and 5,000 to residents of India, Turkey, and Canada. The entire archive costs $150 (about 0.2 cents per record). Dark-web ad for the sale of logs for August 2021 That said, these databases can contain outdated or even useless information, and so some sellers let buyers check the logs to confirm they’re up to date. Another dark-web ad: Fresh logs for $300 per 1,000 records Gamer accounts, games, and inventory Cybercriminals sell access to specific gaming accounts as well, both individually and wholesale. Unsurprisingly, accounts with many games, add-ons, and expensive items hold particular value. Typically cybercriminals sell them at huge discounts. A cybercriminal selling 280,000 gamer accounts for just $4,000 Account content is also traded, again for a fraction of its real value. On the dark web, for example, you can find Need for Speed and other titles selling for less than 50 cents. Games from stolen accounts are sold for a song In-game items are also in circulation. Discounted skins on the underground market How to avoid falling victim to BloodyStealer and other thieves Having games and in-game items sold off is not the only problem that awaits the owner of a stolen account. Cybercriminals or buyers (it makes little difference to the victim) can use the account to launder money, distribute phishing links, and do other illegal things. To avoid falling prey to cybercriminals, make sure your accounts and devices are secure. Protect your accounts with strong passwords, enable two-factor authentication, and generally max out the platform’s security settings (see our guides for Steam , Battle.net , Origin , Twitch , and Discord users). Download apps only from official sources to minimize the chances of picking up BloodyStealer or other malware. Be wary of links in e-mails and messages from strangers. Before entering your credentials on any website, make sure it’s genuine. Use a reliable security solution. For example, Kaspersky Security Cloud blocks BloodyStealer and doesn’t interfere with gameplay ."}}

According to Qrator research , MikroTik’s network devices generated a fair share of the botnet’s traffic. Having analyzed the situation, MikroTik experts found no new vulnerabilities in the company’s routers; however, old ones may still pose a threat. Therefore, to ensure your router has not joined the Mēris botnet (or any other botnet, for that matter), you need to follow a few recommendations. Why MikroTik devices are joining the botnet A few years ago, security research discovered a vulnerability in MikroTik routers : Winbox, a configuration tool for MikroTik routers through which many devices were compromised. Although MikroTik fixed the vulnerability back in 2018, apparently not all users updated their routers. Furthermore, even among those who did, not everyone followed the manufacturer’s additional password-change recommendations. If a user didn’t change the password, then even updated firmware could let attackers log in to the router and start exploiting it again. According to MikroTik , the routers that are now infected with Mēris are the same devices that were compromised back in 2018. The company has published indicators of device compromise and issued recommendations. How to tell if your MikroTik router is part of a botnet When a router joins a botnet, cybercriminals change a number of settings in the device firmware. Therefore, MikroTik’s first recommendation is to look at device configuration and check for the following: A rule that executes the script with the fetch () method. Remove this rule (under System → Scheduler), if present; A SOCKS proxy server enabled. You’ll find the setting under IP → SOCKS ; if you do not use it, disable it; An L2TP client called lvpn, (or any other L2TP client unfamiliar to you). Delete these clients as well; A firewall rule that allows remote access through port 5678. Remove this rule. Recommendations for protecting your MikroTik router Regular updates are a crucial part of any successful defense strategy. Much of keeping a MikroTik network safe is following general network security best practices. Make sure your router is using the latest firmware available, and update it regularly; Disable remote access to the device unless you absolutely need it; Configure remote access — again, if you really need it — through a VPN channel. For example, use the IPsec protocol; Use a long and strong management password. Even if your current password is strong, change it now, just in case; In general, proceed under the assumption  that your local area network is not secure, meaning if one computer gets infected, then the malware can attack the router from inside your perimeter and gain access by brute-forcing passwords. That is why for our part, we strongly recommend using reliable security solutions on all Internet-connected computers."}}

With cybercriminals duping both buyers of mining equipment and cryptoinvestors , we spotlight a scam targeting users of the Luno cryptoexchange. About Luno The Luno cryptocurrency exchange has been in existence since 2013, and today it serves more than 5 million clients in 40 countries. Luno’s primary focus is on emerging markets, allowing users from countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, South Africa, and Nigeria to purchase tokens with local currency. Luno is a centralized exchange (CEX), meaning clients’ cryptowallet keys are stored on the exchange. Typically, such sites are well protected against hacking and leakage. However, account protection becomes much harder when owners spill their credentials to cybercriminals. A simple phishing scheme The attackers who targeted Luno did not reinvent the wheel. Rather, they employed the tried-and-true method of playing on people’s desire for free cryptocurrency, sending potential victims e-mail messages, seemingly from the Luno team, saying that an incoming payment has been “placed on hold due to error(s)” in their profile data. The message includes a link for users to follow and solve the problem. Fake incoming transfer notification with link — just not to Luno As per usual with a phishing attack, the scammers forged the sender’s address, making the message look plausible. The strange address of the link lurking under the button, which looks nothing like luno.com and is located in the .ar domain zone (Argentina), might arouse suspicion. If the victim doesn’t notice this discrepancy and simply clicks, the link takes them through a chain of redirects to an illegitimate Luno login page. The fake resource is very similar in design to the real Luno site, but the cybercriminals did not even try to disguise the URL, apparently counting on user carelessness. The fake login page looks like the real one, although with an entirely different URL To keep the cryptoinvestor victim from suspecting anything is amiss, the scammers even set strict security requirements. For example, to log in to the fake site, you need to enter a strong password with the same strict requirements as the official platform. The password requirements on the fake exchange are as strict as on the real Luno site Next, if the victim enters their credentials and tries to log in, the screen will display a 403 Forbidden error, and that’s it, the attackers now have the password — and access to the victim’s cryptocurrency. Error message on the fake exchange How to guard against cryptophishing Phishing remains a viable method of stealing accounts and money on cryptocurrency platforms. That said, knowing a few simple rules will help minimize the risk of getting hooked. Be vigilant. Unexpected messages about large transfers, gifts, and winnings are nearly always a trick; Carefully check the URL in the address bar before entering credentials. Website spoofing is a common phishing technique; Don’t trust links in e-mails. Instead, bookmark the URLs of cryptocurrency wallets, exchanges, and other important services, and open them using your bookmarks; Use a unique password for each cryptocurrency service (and for all other sites and services as well) so that a hack or data leak on one resource won’t affect your other accounts; Install a reliable antivirus solution to protect against phishing. For example, Kaspersky Internet Security ‘s built-in antiphishing and antifraud modules warn users about potentially dangerous sites in good time."}}
{"https://www.kaspersky.co.in/blog/ransomware-five-tips/23223/": {"metadata": {"dateAccessed": "2021-11-21", "dateCreated": "2021-08-27", "source": "www.kaspersky.co.in"}, "text": "Recent years have seen ransomware grow from an abstract curiosity into a major problem anyone can face — and that hundreds of thousands of people already have . Now a mass industry , ransomware even shows a division of labor, with some criminals writing malicious code and others selecting targets and using the code to infect them, earning a percentage of the ransom. In the past couple of years, ransomers have focused increasingly on organizations, but that does not mean ordinary users are in the clear — people still get hit, sometimes even by accident. If you don’t want to lose your photos, documents, and other files, you cannot avoid picking up a few antiransomware skills and habits. What is ransomware? Ransomware is malware that searches a hard drive for user-valuable information (such as documents, tables, images, and databases) and encrypts everything it finds, locking the files. Next, the ransomware displays a message demanding payment to restore the data. If the victim pays, one of several scenarios may play out: Sometimes the attackers actually send the decryption key with instructions; Some attackers simply take the victim’s money and vanish; In some cases, the cybercriminals cannot recover the data even if they want to — some ransomware damages files irrevocably. Ransomware can get onto your computer in a variety of ways. For example, you might plug in an infected flash drive or download something from a shady website. E-mails with dangerous attachments or links to malicious sites are the most common sources of infection. Perhaps the most unpleasant aspect of many ransomware programs is their ability to spread across devices on the same network. That means if your home desktop picks up malware, you can expect an attack on your laptop as well. And one piece of ransomware on a work device can bring all corporate communications to a standstill. What to do if your data gets encrypted If your data gets encrypted, don’t panic. It’s a bad situation, but you may still be able to recover your files : Do not pay. Each ransom payment represents a financial contribution to malware development and a signal to the cybercriminals that the scheme is profitable. And it may not work — you may get nothing even if you comply. Use the Crypto Sheriff service on the No More Ransom website to find out what malware has infected your drive. A decryptor may already exist for it, in which case you can use it to recover your data without spending a dime. No More Ransom , which is supported by Europol and various anticybercrime companies, hosts dozens of decryptors. If you’re unable to find a decryptor for the ransomware that attacked you, keep checking; one might be released any day. How to stay safe from ransomware Now that you know the enemy, it’s time to learn a few information hygiene rules that can help you avoid ransomware. 1. Make backups Regularly save important files and documents to a cloud storage and to an external hard drive. You can limit photo backups to once a week or even every month, but be sure to back up important, current documents every few days or even daily. Backing up your files doesn’t have to be a chore: See our guide to automatic backup . However you decide to back up your data, don’t delay. Having a backup in the event of a ransomware attack — or if the cat walks across the keyboard and deletes your report — means you don’t have to lose any work. For a successful backup, don’t forget a few important rules: Connect the backup hard drive only when you’re writing to or reading from it. Any drive connected to the computer at the time of a ransomware attack will be encrypted as well. Protect access to cloud storage with a strong password and two-factor authentication. 2. Be careful with messages E-mail attachments and infected websites are the most common hiding places for ransomware Trojans, so treat all unexpected e-mails and messages as potential sources of danger. What makes a message suspicious, though? It’s a gray area requiring consideration and judgment. Make sure you know the sender. Treat content, attachments and links in e-mails from strangers with the utmost skepticism. This applies to messages in messaging apps, social networks, and forums as well. If you have any concerns , consign the message to your spam folder, especially if it promises unexpected payouts. To encounter such messages less often, configure spam filtering and mail traffic scanning in your security solution. If you receive a suspicious link or file that you weren’t expecting from someone you do know, contact them by phone or in another format; their account or mailbox may have been compromised. 3. Avoid suspicious websites Not limiting themselves to links in e-mails, cybercriminals employ a formidable array of tricks to dupe victims into downloading malware. If clicking on a banner results in an unexpected Web resource appearing, or the screen prompting you to download something, close the page immediately. You are very likely seeing an infection attempt. 4. Update software in a timely manner To penetrate devices, cybercriminals often exploit known vulnerabilities that developers have already patched. Anyone who doesn’t update their software regularly is at particular risk. Turn on automatic updates wherever possible, and regularly check for updates for apps that don’t update automatically. 5. Install a security solution Modern security solutions can identify and block malware in real time. For example, Kaspersky Internet Security includes a range of tools to protect users against ransomware. Even in the unlikely event that a particularly cunning piece of malware makes it past file antivirus protection, it won’t be able to do much: Kaspersky Internet Security analyzes the actions of running apps and blocks attempts to encrypt files or rolls back the actions of malicious programs if they manage to damage any data."}}

The Trojan, called Triada, downloads other malware to users’ devices. Here’s how it happened and why using modified versions of WhatsApp is dangerous. Why use WhatsApp mods? Not all users are happy with the official WhatsApp app. Some may feel a need for self-destructing messages or, conversely, the ability to view messages another user deleted. Others are after dynamic themes, and still others want to hide certain chats from the general list or automatically translate messages. Naturally, they want these features right away, not when WhatsApp’s developers finally get around to implementing them. As a result, some users turn to the modified WhatsApp clients available online, which are fairly numerous and not hard to find. Fans of mods are not deterred even by WhatsApp’s occasional crackdown on such modifications or the threat of account bans. The creators of WhatsApp mods often embed ads in them — understandably — along with the features users are looking for. Problems arise, however, from their use of third-party ad modules through which malicious code can sneak in under developers’ radar. Triada et al. in the FMWhatsApp mod That’s precisely what happened with FMWhatsApp, a popular WhatsApp mod. In version 16.80.0 the developers use third-party ad module that includes a Trojan. Our mobile antivirus solution detects this malware as Trojan.AndroidOS.Triada.ef. We saw a similar situation in the spring of 2021 with the APKPure unofficial app store, whose developers also used an ad module from an unverified source, thereby infecting their creation , and consequently users, with the Triada Trojan (albeit a slightly different version). As in the case of the infected APKPure, the Triada Trojan in the dangerous version of the FMWhatsApp mod performs an intermediary function. First, it collects data about the user’s device, and then, depending on the information, it downloads another Trojan. Triada’s “extras” come in a variety of flavors — the infected version of FMWhatsApp downloads several types of malware to devices: Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Agent.ic, a Trojan that downloads and runs other malicious modules; Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Gapac.e, which downloads and runs other malicious modules and can also display full-screen ads at unexpected moments; Trojan-Downloader.AndroidOS.Helper.a, which downloads and runs the installer module of the xHelper Trojan and runs invisible ads in the background; Trojan.AndroidOS.MobOk.i, a Trojan that signs up for paid subscriptions; Trojan.AndroidOS.Subscriber.l, another Trojan that signs up for paid subscriptions; Trojan.AndroidOS.Whatreg.b, the most complex Trojan in the list, signs in to the WhatsApp account on the victim’s phone, intercepting the login confirmation text. The device can then become a site for various types of illegal activity such as spam distribution or illegal trading. Our Securelist post delves more into the FMWhatsapp mod’s Triada Trojan. How to defend against such attacks Practicing caution and using your device safely is key to keeping malware and other mobile nasties off your phone. Generally speaking, follow these tips to avoid trouble: Avoid installing apps from unofficial sources and use your device’s settings to deny permission to install them. (If you need to install an app not from an official store, temporarily enable that permission and then disable it again); Use only official messaging apps, and download them only from official app stores — they may lack some features, but will not flood your phone with viruses; Check what permissions you’ve granted to installed apps — some might pose a real threat ; Install a reliable mobile antivirus app on your phone, and heed its warnings."}}

Here are some we’ve found over the past year. Cyberattacks on gamers Our experts took a look at how cybercriminals made money from gamers who skimped on both gaming and security, ending up with unexpected apps along with (or instead of) the games they thought they were downloading. Want some ads? Perhaps the most common surprise greedy gamers find in their popular games is adware. Although not usually too harmful, adware can be very annoying. With this uninvited guest on their computer or smartphone, users will constantly be closing banners, pop-up videos, and browser pages they didn’t open. Cryptomining, a timeless threat In the hierarchy of bad stuff users might get with pirated games, cryptominers rank far higher than adware. Gamers, with their souped-up computers and brawny video cards, make ideal targets for cryptocurrency freeloaders — and a miner concealed inside a game with high system requirements can go unnoticed for quite some time, during which the computer is working for a malicious third party. Swarez: Danger at the top of search results Most gamers know that the place to get official games is a specialized store such as Steam. But for a “Minecraft crack” or “virus-free FIFA,” they turn to search engines. Cybercriminals take advantage of this, creating websites offering free keys, cracks, and unlocked versions of games; adding Trojans; and pushing them onto the first page of search results. Alternatively, they can load infected, pirated copies onto existing warez sites. That is how the Swarez loader gets distributed. Users who try to download, say, cracks for Minecraft get sent through a long chain of redirects to a page with a ZIP archive, inside of which is another password-protected ZIP and a text file with a key. Unzipping the archive loads Swarez on the unfortunate gamer’s device, where it proceeds to download Taurus spyware, a Trojan that takes screenshots and steals cryptowallets, desktop files, and passwords and other data stored in browsers. Fake Minecraft targets Android users Minecraft remains very popular cyberattack bait, including on smartphones and tablets. Back in 2020, we found more than 20 malicious apps on Google Play disguised as mods for the game, and this year saw a repeat . The game also serves as a front for Hqwar malware, which reports an installation error and prompts the user to uninstall the app. In fact, that removes only the icon; the malware remains, working in stealth mode to harvest online bank credentials. Vesub Trojan disguised as Brawl Stars and PUBG Another example of cunning malware, Vesub, hides in pirated versions of Brawl Stars and PUBG for Android. When run, the malware appears to load very slowly — and then, nothing. The victim, seeing the game is not working, quits. The icon disappears from the screen at that point, but the Trojan remains on the device and gets to work. What’s actually happening during that fake startup is data collection: Vesub collects system data and receives further instructions. Then, running in the background, it can subscribe the victim to paid services, send text messages from their smartphone, play YouTube videos, visit app pages on Google Play, and open advertising websites. And then there’s phishing By now you should understand quite well that downloading pirated games is far more trouble than it’s worth. If so, your gaming experience just became a lot safer. However, you should know about another way cybercriminals exploit gamers’ quest for freebies: offering bundles of games at a 99% discount, promising mountains of free or near-free in-game currency, and inviting players to take part in nonexistent tournaments. Hiding behind famous titles — from FIFA 21 and Apex Legends to GTA Online and Pokemon Go — cybercriminals scoop up victims’ e-mail addresses, social network names and login credentials, and game info. Even without passwords, such information fetches a price on the dark web . Need we state that by entering your password on an unofficial site, you run the risk of losing your account? Even worse is if the victim, asked for payment card details for “verification,” agrees. What happens next, you know only too well. How to get games risk-free The risks gamers face are neither new nor particularly unusual. Although gamers appear to be a relatively risk-tolerant group, you can practice safe gaming by following some commonsense tips: Buy games (yes, buy them) from official stores only. You can still save money on video games , and you need not walk into traps. For example, publishers hold sales regularly and even host the occasional giveaway. By waiting for official discounts, you not only minimize the chance of a run-in with malware, but also support the developers and get the latest patches for your favorite games in good time. Be careful when downloading games. Cybercriminals often promote malicious pages that appear to be well-known online stores. Unfortunately, you cannot trust search engines completely, here. Just download the platform’s official app (if it has one), bookmark its website, or enter the URL manually. Follow our simple security guide for buying loot boxes or other virtual goods: One rule, for example, is never to trust shady sites offering cheap unique skins, weapons, and so forth. Check the security settings of services you use, and see our how-to guides for protecting accounts on Steam , Battle.net , Origin , Discord , Twitch , and other platforms . Install a reliable antivirus solution on your computer and smartphone, and never disable it. Contrary to popular myth, antivirus software does not cause game slowdown , especially if you configure it correctly."}}

For responsible users, the idea of being banned for, say, displaying suicidal content or trying to impersonate someone else might seem like a bad dream or a cruel joke, but it’s quite real for victims of the new wave of so-called ban attacks. Here’s how these attacks work, how to defend against them, and what to do if your account has been hit. How cybercriminals block Instagram profiles It’s all quite simple: Detractors or competitors can pay a fee (the amount depends on the seller or even the number of followers) to have your profile blocked. Such attacks began last fall , but of late they’ve become particularly high-profile. Recently, online magazine Motherboard connected with a cybercriminal group and learned how they exploit Instagram’s policy to make money through ban-as-a-service offerings . The group’s favored tactic is the fake impersonation complaint, which involves verified accounts, identifiable by the blue check next to the username. The attackers use verified accounts to create a full copy of the victim’s profile, right down to the avatar and description. Then they file a complaint against the original, accusing the owner of impersonation. If the victim’s account is not verified, the support service bans the victim. The second blocking method is to inundate tech support with messages alleging that the victim’s profile contains images of suicide or self-mutilation. In many cases, Instagram takes the easier path, blocking accounts on the basis of such complaints without first checking their actual content. Unlike phishing and other similar schemes that still require action from the victim — clicking a dangerous link, for example — a ban attack works with no victim participation whatsoever. The target, who might never even dream of violating the terms of use, simply finds their account blocked. According to the Motherboard reporters, the service is inexpensive, running about $5 to $60, so the cybercriminals have no shortage of customers. However, not all users who abuse Instagram’s moderation practices are in it to make money. Malicious scripts are freely available, and any online hooligan can use them to settle a personal score or silence a disagreeable blogger. Instagram unblocking for a fee In fact, blocking Instagram accounts opens up another money-generating avenue: restoring them. Unblocking carries a far higher fee than blocking — reportedly up to $3,500–$4,000. Whether the same people are behind the banning and the unblocking services, or whether it’s an accidental symbiosis, remains unclear for now. Some users do receive an offer to reinstate their account just a few minutes after the blocking, however, and those offers often come from followers of the accounts from which the original complaints came. What to do if your Instagram profile gets blocked If you’re already the victim of a ban attack, contact Instagram support immediately with an explanation of what happened. Bans are appealable only through the app . To do so, you will need to enter your username and password, then follow the instructions. If anyone comes knocking with an offer to restore your account for money, don’t pay! First, you have no guarantee that anything will come of it. Second, doing so supports confirmed miscreants — perhaps even the ones who got your account banned in the first place. Third, the official recovery procedure through Instagram support is free. How to protect your Instagram profile Unfortunately, users tend to learn about a ban attack only after the fact. Instagram told Motherboard that it plans to sniff out cybercriminal accounts on the platform, and asks users to report any suspicious activity, but that approach is time-consuming. In the meantime, we suggest you take some measures to protect yourself. Verify your account The ban-attack business centers on accusations of impersonation, so the best way to protect yourself is to convince Instagram that you are you before anything happens. In other words, you should verify your account now. The social network won’t check every user, but you may have some points in your favor. For example, if you or your business has been mentioned in multiple news sources , that helps. To get the coveted blue check mark, you’ll want to complete your profile and delete any old accounts to avoid arousing suspicion. Naturally, the account must also be public and not violate Instagram’s terms of use. Once you’ve ensured your account is ready, send a verification request . You can do it directly through the app: Go to your profile settings; Select Account ; Select Request Verification ; Enter your full name and attach required documentation; Follow the subsequent instructions. Make your account private What if you’re not famous enough to pass blue-check verification? You can take the radical step of closing your account to the public. If you make your account private, then your posts, photos, and videos will be available only to subscribers, which means that an attacker won’t be able to copy them and accuse you of impersonation. Whether in the app or a browser, it is not difficult to make your account private. See our post on setting up Instagram security and privacy for detailed instructions. Be sure to take the trouble to clean up your list of followers as well, and check future follower requests before accepting them. Bots and other barely there accounts can hide attackers, and you’re under no obligation to let them in. Change your profile pic For business profiles that you cannot close but that aren’t well-known enough for verification — or that you feel you must keep open for any other reason — there’s another way to reduce the risk of ban attacks: Change your avatar. Fake impersonation complaints work best on profiles with a real photo of the owner. Some underground ban-attack services even refuse to target accounts with other avatars. That means putting up something that isn’t your portrait complicates attempts to do harm; every bit helps. Maintain a backup and update contact information Instagram admins do what they can to combat wrongful complaints, but they’re working against cybercriminals who continually improve their money-making schemes. In a perfect world you wouldn’t have to, but here and now, you should prepare an escape route. First, make sure you have access to the e-mail address and phone number linked to your profile. If your account is wrongfully blocked, you can use them for recovery. Second, save your content regularly. That way, if worse comes to worst, you can use it to migrate to a new account."}}

But like all forms of cold calling, phone scams are resource-intensive and highly inefficient. Therefore, some scammers try to optimize the process by getting potential victims to call them. One tool they use is good old-fashioned spam. “If you didn’t make this purchase, please call us” We recently detected several waves of spam e-mails, seemingly from reputable companies, notifying recipients of substantial purchases. The item in question is usually a high-end device such as the latest Apple Watch or a gaming laptop purchased from Amazon or paid for through PayPal. Fake PayPal/Amazon purchase confirmations with vishing phone numbers Other, more exotic variants crop up from time to time. For example, we detected an e-mail about the purchase of $1,999 worth of “Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin)”: Fake PayPal notification, including the scammers’ phone number, of a “Cryptocurrency (Bitcoin)” purchase Other, similar notifications mention the purchase of security software licenses — we’ve seen some referring to Norton and even Kaspersky (although our product lineup has never included a “Kaspersky Total Protection.”) Fake notifications about the purchase of Norton and “Kaspersky Total Protection” licenses with vishing phone numbers The scam relies on recipients being so alarmed by the not-insubstantial loss that they will act rashly, hoping to get their money back. Of course, their money hasn’t gone anywhere — at least, not yet. This particular strain of spam e-mails contain no links, but they do include a phone number that the victim is asked to call if they want to change or cancel the order. Sometimes the number sits unobtrusively somewhere at the bottom of the text. Other times it is highlighted in red and repeated several times in the message. What happens if you call? Most likely the scammers will try to wangle your login credentials for some financial service or bank card details. Alternatively, they might try to trick you into transferring money or even installing a Trojan on your computer, which has been known to happen . The only limits are the scammers’ imagination and vishing skills. How to guard against such e-mails The particulars may change, but all scams have certain elements in common: the use of some sort of trick to get someone to do something. Vishing is no different. Follow these guidelines for safety: Do not call back; Log in to your account with the service in question — type the address into your browser; don’t click on any links in the message — and check your orders or recent activity page; Check your balance and the list of recent transactions on all of your cards, if you have reason for concern; Install a reliable antivirus utility with protection against financial attacks, phishing, and online fraud."}}
