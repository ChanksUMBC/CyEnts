In reality, the dark web is one of the most over-hyped and misunderstood terms in the cybersecurity industry today. However, if you cut through the noise, you’ll find that the dark web is an enormously valuable source of information for third-party risk management professionals. What is the Dark Web? The dark web is a subset of the Internet. It’s accessible via special software such as Tor that allows users and website operators to remain anonymous or untraceable. Websites on the dark web operate in their own unique environment, separated from surface sites such as Amazon, eBay, or Youtube. Cybercriminals use the dark web to coordinate and execute cyber attacks, as well as to sell stolen data and even exploits into companies. However, not all parts of the dark web are equal. Many portions are accessible to anyone willing to download Tor. The information you find in these relatively easy-to-access parts of the dark web are often of limited value. Other parts of the dark web are invite-only, requiring special access that requires years of effort developing personas accepted among the cybercriminal community. This closed part of the dark web is where one more often can find information of high value. These closed channels, also known as the criminal underground, can extend beyond the proper dark web and into private criminal forums hosted on Telegram, Discord, and other places. Why Does the Dark Web Matter for Third-Party Risk Management? Third-party risk management teams are tasked with assessing risk across the entire full vendor lifecycle, from vendor selection to relationship termination. When it comes to assessing cybersecurity risk, one of the most important questions to understand is “has my vendor recently experienced a cyber attack or breach?” Unfortunately, current methods to assess this information – questionnaires, onsite audits, and  penetration testing – can’t fully answer this question. The dark web provides a unique view into that you cannot get elsewhere, helping identify several high-risk factors that a vendor has, or is about to breached: Ransomware extortion. Ransomware operators use extortion sites to threaten their victims into paying ransoms, under threat of publicly releasing stolen data. While the practice is deplorable, these dark web sites provide an early warning signal that one of your third-parties has been struck by ransomware. In some cases you can even use the sites to verify if any of your data was leaked via your third-party. Stolen data . Sensitive data including IP, PII, and HIPAA information frequently find their way to the dark web, likely indicating a breach of a third-party. Leaked credentials. Company email addresses and passwords are often for sale on the dark web. Leaked credentials indicate a potential attack coming soon. Company access for sale. Some threat actors use the dark web to sell direct access to a company through a vulnerability. By identifying the sale of these vulnerabilities, you can proactively stop future breaches of your third parties. Cyber chatter. Threat actors are known to discuss their recent attacks and upcoming plans on underground channels. Keeping a close eye on mentions of your third parties can help you stay in front of breaches and upcoming cyber attacks. Continuously Monitor the Dark Web with Third-Party Intelligence The dark web is too widespread and complex for any single individual to successfully monitor. Third-party intelligence from Recorded Future does that work for you, by automatically collecting and analyzing posts from the dark to deliver high-confidence indicators of risk including ransomware extortion, leaked credentials, and high-volumes of attention on high-tier forums. Third-party risk professionals use third-party intelligence to stay on top of their vendors, allowing them to proactively identify and mitigate risk as it surfaces.

The cybersecurity community was rocked by the news of SolarWinds , and news keeps flying as we see widespread attacks on technology such as Accellion FTA and Microsoft Exchange . Traditional methods to manage third-party risk can’t keep up. Governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) teams, as well as their security counterparts, continue to struggle to accurately assess risk given the continually shifting circumstances surrounding who they do business with. And for many, maintaining on-going visibility into their vendors’ constantly changing risk profile is a difficult or impossible task. There’s A Better Way To Manage Third-Party Risk — With Intelligence GRC and security teams need a proactive approach to identify, manage, and mitigate third-party risk, and intelligence is here to help. Intelligence acts as a source of truth on key risk indicators, eliminating the guesswork associated with assessing vendor risk. It reduces the time you spend on vendor risk assessments by 50%, and greatly enhances the quality of those assessments. Most importantly, intelligence gives you the confidence and context you need to take control of third-party risk. There’s no need for panicked responses to breaking news on third-party breaches. Intelligence enables you to stay in front of a constantly changing risk landscape. Gain Unparalleled Visibility into Your Third-Parties’ Risk in Real-Time Recorded Future’s Third-Party Intelligence Module uses the power of the world’s largest commercial collection platform to provide the most complete picture of cyber risk. By automatically collecting, aggregating, and analyzing information from over one million distinct sources, Recorded Future is able to provide real-time visibility into the risks of your third parties. Leveraging our proprietary data sourcing and unique background as an intelligence provider, we provide unprecedented insight into a wide range of security risks to allow you to instantly assess risk including: Security incidents — Cyber attacks and security breach disclosures are essential risk indicators to monitor third parties for. Our threat research team Insikt Group often adds their own analysis to major security incidents, giving you fast insight into what happened, why it matters, and what you can do about it Malicious network activity — Infrastructure abuse such as communication with C2 servers, hosted TOR notes, and malware detections all indicate that a company is highly vulnerable to attack. Dark web and ransomware extortion site attention — Cybercriminals often use the dark web and other underground channels to discuss cyber attacks involving your third parties. Ransomware extortion sites, for example, are a high-risk indicator that your third party was likely struck by ransomware. However, not all dark web sites are equal. Recorded Future is the only third-party intelligence provider granting access to invite-only, high-tier dark web forums. Leaked credentials — Exposed data from business accounts used by employees on dark web and paste sites leave third-parties exposed to credential stuffing attacks and account impersonation. Our massive collection of leaked credentials and data dumps is constantly growing. Intelligence Tailor-Made for Risk Management Teams For a long time, threat intelligence has held a reputation as being complex and inaccessible to those without a background in it. In fact, ten years ago, the notion of a GRC team actively consuming threat intelligence would have been laughable. Recorded Future’s Third-Party Intelligence module is specifically created for the GRC team, providing key risk indicators that help to assess, monitor, and mitigate risk. Transparent remediation details are provided with all findings, giving GRC teams the leverage they need to work with their third-parties to mitigate risk. In addition, intelligence is aligned to the NIST cybersecurity framework , making it simple to incorporate intelligence directly within existing business practices. If your organization uses NIST as the basis of vendor risk assessments, you can easily map intelligence directly to your questionnaire, allowing you to quickly validate submissions. Break Down Barriers Between Risk and Security Teams GRC teams and security teams both want to protect the business. However, they often use different terminology, frameworks, and technologies to do their jobs, creating misalignment and miscommunication when the teams need to work together. Modular intelligence offerings from Recorded Future work as your middleman, providing a common language and platform to understand, communicate, and action risk across teams.

Register now to see how a tightly integrated end-to-end process of threat management can improve your team’s ability to make decisions quickly and mitigate risk. End-to-End Integrated Threat Management Solution As the attack surface grows, the abundance of security threats puts added stress on already overworked security professionals struggling to pinpoint, triage, and respond to real threats targeting their organization. With too little time and not enough information, trying to determine if an alert represents a critical incident or a false positive wastes valuable time while true positives may be slipping through the cracks. With IBM Security solutions, you can unite your defenses across the four pillars of threat management – visibility, detection, investigation and response. IBM Security provides real-time monitoring and correlation of the vast amount of security events and network traffic in your organization for faster identification and remediation of incidents. Augmenting these events and alerts with real-time intelligence from Recorded Future delivers more context to improve analyst efficiency and confidence. Using our joint solutions , analysts can reduce time spent understanding “why” an IOC is bad, and more time mitigating risk in their environment. Supercharging IBM Security QRadar with SecOps Intelligence To effectively respond to the multitude of alerts generated each day, security operations teams need a way to prioritize which alerts to focus on first so they can optimize their effort for maximum risk reduction. Security intelligence from Recorded Future creates clarity by adding rich context within IBM Security QRadar . Relevant insights, updated in real time, give security operations analysts the insights they need — when and where they need them — to make faster, more confident security decisions. Recorded Future automates the collection, analysis, and production of security intelligence at scale to drive accelerated responses across vast amounts of data. Using a sophisticated combination of our patented algorithm process and world-class human analysis, Recorded Future fuses the broadest range of open source, dark web, technical sources, and original research.

For the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology (OIST) , the Recorded Future and IBM Security QRadar joint solution resulted in a 25% reduction of false positive QRadar offenses. Keita Nagase, OIST chief information security officer, also shared, “By integrating intelligence into our existing IBM Security QRadar system and workflows, and automating analysis, we believe we have improved the accuracy and operational efficiency of security monitoring by a factor of three or four.” Accelerating Intelligence-Driven Investigations in IBM Security SOAR Orchestration and automation are key drivers for digital transformation, enabling organizations to optimize existing processes, lower costs, fill personnel gaps, and gain a competitive edge. Recognizing these clear benefits, security operations teams are embracing SOAR technology to collect and analyze threat data from multiple sources and automate repeatable incident response tasks. But for SOAR solutions to work effectively, they require a series of defined playbooks designed to automate repeatable security workflows — and these playbooks are only as smart and effective as the data used to construct them. IBM Security SOAR helps security teams respond to cyber threats with confidence, automate with intelligence, and collaborate with consistency. It captures and codifies established incident response processes into dynamic playbooks to guide and empower security analysts with knowledge to resolve incidents. Augmenting investigations with external intelligence from Recorded Future allows analysts to resolve incidents faster, validate risk assigned to artifacts, and reduce overall risk to the organization. Recorded Future delivers more context than threat feeds, updates in real time so intelligence stays relevant, and integrates out-of-the-box with IBM Security SOAR .

It only takes one financially motivated criminal, dissatisfied customer, or disgruntled employee to tarnish your company’s hard-earned brand reputation . Fake or malicious online content, data leaks, and more can negatively influence customers and create financial risk for your organization — without ever touching your network or systems. Security analysts could spend virtually all of their time scoring the internet for company mentions and analyzing data points and still not be able to keep up with constantly morphing brand threats. To proactively protect your brand , you need to see everywhere your organization’s name, associated products, executive names, and keywords exist across the internet — at any given moment. That’s where brand intelligence comes in – harnessing automation, analytics, andhuman expertise to not only map, monitor, and score events related to brand risk, but also making it easy to take down malicious content, such as typosquat domains and  disinformation on social media. Discover what’s putting your brand at risk in “ The Security Intelligence Handbook, Third Edition: How to Disrupt Adversaries and Reduce Risk With Security Intelligence .” In this excerpt, which has been edited and condensed, see how a large HR solutions provider defeated typosquatting with a proactive approach to digital brand protection: Brand protection involves safeguarding an organization’s image, reputation, and customers from attacks that primarily never touch its network or systems. These threats include: Fake websites and social media accounts used to impersonate the organization or its employees for fraud and phishing attacks Malicious content and false information about the organization and its products posted on websites and social media platforms Counterfeit products and software offered in digital marketplaces and app stores Data leaks and leaked credentials from employees and executives Most of these threats are posed by financially motivated criminals, but they may also involve hacktivists, dissatisfied customers, competitors, and careless or disgruntled employees who reveal information online. Protect Your Brand and Your Customers To truly protect your brand, you need to be concerned about threats that leverage it to harm or influence your customers. Customers who are lured into a scam or fraud from an imitation of your website may hold your organization responsible. Those who buy a low-quality, counterfeit version of your product from an online marketplace may lose trust in your brand. Those who think one of your executives has published offensive content on the web may boycott your products — even if it wasn’t your executive who posted it. Pleading “it wasn’t our fault” won’t restore their trust or your reputation in any of these scenarios. A Different Kind of Detection Most of the activities we have been discussing in this handbook involve creating intelligence about attackers and their tools. Brand intelligence includes some of that, as well, but the emphasis is instead on detecting your organization’s name and brand everywhere they occur across the internet. You need to be rigorous about listing and searching for mentions of all your brand and product names, and keywords that are associated with them. These include the names of: Your parent organization Subsidiaries and business units Products Executives Managers and employees who engage with the public in web forums and via social media It also includes trademarks, service marks, and advertising slogans that appear on your organization’s authorized websites, since these are frequently used on phony websites. Uncovering Evidence of Brand Impersonation and Abuse Knowing what to look for empowers you to find evidence of brand impersonation and abuse in places many organizations never search. For example, a brand intelligence solution enables you to: Search domain registries to find domain names that include your organization or product name, or variations of them Crawl the web to find typosquatting domains Monitor social media to alert you to hashtags that include your organization or product name, or variations of them Scan social media to detect accounts that claim to belong to your organization, your executives, or your employees Check app stores to uncover unauthorized mobile apps using your branding Comb web forums for threat actors planning to impersonate your brand Use case: Typosquatting and fraudulent domains Typosquatting involves manipulating the characters in an organization’s domain name into nearly identical domains. For instance, threat actors targeting example.com might create a typosquat URL of exanple.com. Attackers often register thousands of domains differing by a single character from their target organizations’ URLs. They do this for reasons ranging from suspicious to fully malicious. Rogue websites using these modified domain names are built to look like legitimate websites. The rogue domains and websites are often used in spear-phishing campaigns against employees or customers, watering-hole attacks, and drive-by download attacks. Being alerted to newly registered phishing and typosquatting domains in real time is the best way to narrow the window of opportunity for threat actors to impersonate your brand and defraud unsuspecting users. Once the malicious infrastructure is identified, you’re able to employ a takedown service to nullify the threat. Uncovering Evidence of Breaches on the Web By monitoring the web — including private forums on the dark web — brand intelligence solutions enable you to uncover evidence of data breaches within your organization and partner ecosystem. You may find: Your customers’ names and data Financial account data and Social Security numbers Leaked or stolen credentials from your employees Paste and bin sites containing your proprietary software code Forums mentioning your organization and announcing intentions to attack it Forums selling tools and discussing techniques to attack organizations like yours Timely discovery of these indicators enables you to: Secure the sources of the data Find and fix vulnerabilities and misconfigurations in your infrastructure Mitigate future risks by improving security controls Identify ways to improve employee training and coding practices Enable your SecOps and incident response teams to recognize attacks faster It’s often possible to narrow down the source of a leak by looking at exactly what information and artifacts are found on the web, where they are found, and what else is found in the same place. For example, if you find product designs or software code on a dark web site and recognize that they were shared with only a few suppliers, you would know to investigate the security controls of those suppliers as part of your third-party risk management program. If your organization’s name was mentioned on a hacker’s forum whose members are known to attack certain applications, you could increase protection of the targeted applications by patching the systems they run on, monitoring them more closely, and adding security controls. Use case: Compromised data Threat actors make money from many types of compromised personal information and corporate intellectual property. Examples of compromised data for sale on the dark web include medical records, cloned and compromised gift cards, and stolen credentials to “pay for” services like Netflix and Uber, and items charged via PayPal, as illustrated in Figure 10-1. A high percentage of hacking-related breaches leverage stolen or weak passwords. Threat actors regularly upload massive caches of usernames and passwords to paste sites and the dark web, or make them available for sale on underground marketplaces. These data dumps may include corporate email addresses and passwords, as well as login details for other sites. Monitoring external sources for this type of intelligence will dramatically increase your visibility — not just into leaked credentials, but also into potential breaches of corporate data and proprietary code. Critical Qualities for Security Intelligence Solutions Of course, mitigating digital risk to your brand is not simply a matter of stumbling across one typosquatting domain or some isolated piece of stolen data. Somebody, or something, has to do the broader work of collecting masses of data, sifting through thousands of data points, analyzing relationships among the data points, deciding priorities, and ultimately taking action. The best approach is to use a brand intelligence solution that: Collects and scans data from the broadest range and variety of sources : Automation at the data-collection stage saves analysts precious time. The best solutions gather data not only from open web sources, but also from the dark web and technical sources. Maps, monitors, and scores brand risk : Through automation, advanced data science, and analytical techniques like natural language processing, effective brand intelligence tools enable analysts to link business attributes with related digital assets and detect, score, and prioritize events related to brand risk. Coordinates remediation : Robust brand intelligence solutions generate alerts and reports that provide information on how to remediate problems. They also integrate with tools that perform remediation immediately and with service providers that take down instances of domain abuse.

This free trial offers Splunk users full access to our high-confidence, actionable, real-time SecOps intelligence within their own Splunk environment, empowering them to make faster, more confident security decisions. This announcement is directly related to one of our core guiding principles at Recorded Future, security intelligence is for everyone. Security intelligence provides clear, actionable context that all security roles can use, to work smarter and amplify their impact. Shortening the “Time to No”: Real-Time Context for Splunk For years, security operations teams have relied on SIEM technologies like Splunk to collect, correlate, and analyze security event logs from a variety of sources across their network environments. SIEM tools were built to help teams quickly detect and respond to threats, while streamlining compliance reporting and post-incident investigation. Yet as the attack surface grows, the abundance of security alerts puts added stress on already overworked security professionals. If you’re like most analysts, you’re plagued by alert fatigue and you struggle to pinpoint, triage, and respond to real threats targeting your organization using only information from your internal environment. You’re dealing with too little time and not enough information while your SIEM continues to generate thousands of security alerts each day, making it difficult to determine which alert represents a critical incident and which may just be a redundancy or a false positive. Valuable time is wasted getting to “no” for irrelevant alerts, while true positives may be slipping through the cracks. To effectively respond to the multitude of alerts generated each day, security operations teams need a way to prioritize which alerts to focus on first so they can optimize their effort for maximum risk reduction. Security intelligence from Recorded Future creates clarity by adding rich context within Splunk Enterprise and ES . Relevant insights, updated in real time, give security operations analysts the insights they need — when they need them — to make faster, more confident security decisions. Recorded Future automates the collection, analysis, and production of security intelligence at scale to drive accelerated responses across vast amounts of data. Using a sophisticated combination of our patented algorithm process and world-class human analysis, Recorded Future fuses the broadest range of open source, dark web, technical sources, and original research. This results in relevant, real-time insights, integrated with Splunk to empower security operations analysts with the insights they need to accomplish the following use cases: Alert Triage : Recorded Future enriches Splunk alerts with a risk score that updates in real time and is backed by transparent evidence. This provides the context analysts need to quickly discount false positives, identify the most significant threats, and take immediate action. Threat Detection : Quickly identify potential threats by automatically correlating internal data with Recorded Future intelligence and risk scores. This enables you to detect threats earlier and respond faster by adding valuable context in Splunk to internal network observables from firewall, email security, and endpoint solutions. Relevant insights, updated in real time, and integrated out-of-the-box into Splunk give security operations teams the right information at the right time to disrupt adversaries and prevent damage to their organization.

The SolarWinds breach continues to make headlines, underscoring the importance of third-party risk management programs . Yet supply chain attacks are not new, and most organizations are exposed to significant risks through their relationships with third parties. A recent Ponemon Institute study found more than half of organizations have had a breach that originated from a third party. As both digital and physical supply chains grow in size and complexity, every third-party relationship introduces an element of risk to your organization. That’s why you need a way to objectively understand, monitor, and measure your exposure to third-party risk in real time across your supply chain. Static risk assessment methods often fall short. Spreadsheets, questionnaires, and email are labor-intensive, prone to error or bias, and only capture risk at a point in time. Not to mention that companies often learn that their third party suffered a breach days or weeks after they’ve been reported. Organizations need real-time intelligence on their third parties to take rapid and informed risk-based action. Precision third-party intelligence provides automated visibility at scale to identify risk exposures hidden across the third-party ecosystem so that security and risk teams are able to prioritize and proactively manage third-party risk. Explore the impact of increasing third-party risk in “ The Security Intelligence Handbook, Third Edition: How to Disrupt Adversaries and Reduce Risk With Security Intelligence .” In this excerpt, which has been edited and condensed, you’ll learn how to reduce your overall risk of data breaches and reputational damage brought about through vulnerable third parties: Third-Party Risk Looms Large Because businesses and their supply chains are so tightly integrated, it’s critical to consider the security of your partners, vendors, and other third parties when assessing the risk profile of your own organization. A recent survey by the Ponemon Institute, “Digital Transformation & Cyber Risk: What You Need to Know to Stay Safe,” found that 55 percent of organizations have had a breach that originated from a third party, and 53 percent say their tools for managing third-party risk are only somewhat effective or are not effective. These and related statistics are shown in Figure 9-1. The writing is on the wall: Third-party attacks will continue to increase and get worse and will further complicate cyber risk management. Traditional third-party risk assessment methods rely on static outputs, like self-assessments, financial audits, monthly reports about new vulnerabilities discovered in the systems an organization uses, and occasional reports on the status of security control compliance. All of these become outdated quickly, and they don’t provide the comprehensive intelligence you need to make informed decisions about managing third-party risks to your organization. In contrast, real-time security intelligence, specifically thirdparty intelligence, enables you to accurately assess risk posed by third parties and keep assessments current as conditions change and new threats emerge. Traditional Risk Assessments Fall Short Many of the most common third-party risk management practices employed today lag behind security requirements. Static assessments of risk — like financial audits and security certificate verifications — are still important, but they often lack context and timeliness. Organizations following traditional approaches to managing third-party risk often use these three steps: They attempt to understand their organization’s business relationship with a third party and how it exposes their organization to threats. Based on that understanding, they identify frameworks to evaluate the third party’s financial health, corporate controls, and IT security and hygiene, as well as how these factors relate to their own organization’s approach to security. Using those frameworks, they assess the third party to determine whether it is compliant with security standards like SOC 2 or FISMA. Sometimes they conduct a financial audit of the third party. While these steps are essential for evaluating third-party risk, they don’t tell the whole story. The outputs are static and cannot reflect quickly changing conditions and emerging threats. The analysis is often too simplistic to produce actionable recommendations. Sometimes, the final report is opaque, making it impossible to dig deeper into the methodology behind the analysis. All of these factors create blind spots that leave decision-makers unsure whether crucial pieces of information might have been overlooked. When assessing third-party risk, do not rely entirely on self reporting questionnaires or a vendor’s inwardly focused view of their own security defenses. Round these out with an external, unbiased perspective on the vendor’s threat landscape. Three Things to Look for in Security Intelligence To accurately evaluate third-party risk in real time, you need a solution that offers immediate context on the current threat landscape. Security intelligence — delivered in the form of third-party intelligence — provides critical context that enables you to determine which shortcomings in your supply-chain partners’ defenses represent meaningful risks to your organization. Those include not only the risks present at the time of assessment, but also current risks and a historical view — which provide even more context to detect, prevent, and resolve risks. To effectively evaluate third-party risk, a third-party intelligence solution needs to offer: Automation and analytics to quickly and comprehensively sort massive amounts of data Real-time alerts on threats and changes to risks Ongoing visibility into your partners’ ever-changing threat environments Automation and analytics To manage risk for your organization, you need access to massive amounts of threat data from a wide variety of sources across the open web, the dark web, as well as technical and news sources and discussion forums. The same applies to assessing risks introduced by the third parties in your supply chain. However, given the scale of cybersecurity-related content from these sources, totaling billions of facts, you need a third-party intelligence solution that uses automation and algorithms to collect and analyze these details. It must be able to: Analyze, classify, connect, fuse, and index data points using natural language processing and multiple analytical models Generate objective, data-driven risk scores using a straightforward formula Provide clear, accessible evidence for the risk scores it assigns Real-time updates to risk scores Static assessments quickly become outdated. Weekly or monthly intelligence reports produced by human analysts provide essential overviews, but often arrive too late to enable effective action. Risk scoring is much more effective when it updates in real time and draws on a large pool of sources. These capabilities make risk scores much more reliable for making immediate assessments and reaching security decisions. For example, a trading partner might generally be regarded as low risk based on standard reporting. However, let’s say the partner suffers a data breach that may or may not affect your organization. If you rely solely on static risk assessments, you likely won’t know the breach happened in the first place — or you’ll find out too late. You may have to wait too long to acquire the intelligence needed to accurately evaluate the risk. What was the cause of the breach? Was it an exploited vulnerability in a system used by the partner? A social engineering attack? Static assessments alone do not provide the evidence required to justify asking that third party to put additional security controls in place. If you want to boost the effectiveness of your third-party risk program, start by thinking critically about five key questions: Who are my most critical vendors? What am I legally accountable for? What is my current vendor risk assessment process? Who else in my organization needs this information? How does the global threat landscape affect my partners? Transparent risk assessments What’s the point of a risk assessment if you can’t use it to get your third parties to take action? Information without context leaves us like Cassandra in Greek mythology. In a bid for her love, the god Apollo gave her the gift of prophecy, but still she scorned his romantic advances. In his anger, Apollo let her keep her foresight, but he cursed her so that nobody would ever believe her warnings about the future. Many risk assessments today suffer the same fate as Cassandra’s prophecies. When we rely on vague scoring methods or opaque sourcing, our advice is hard to accept, even if it’s accurate. Too often, organizations fail to act on intelligence because leaders don’t understand it or don’t know the source. A security intelligence solution must show the risk rules that are triggered by an alert — and be transparent about its sources (Figure 9-2). This enables security professionals to see for themselves why something like an alert on a particular IP address might represent a real risk. The extra detail also eliminates the suspicion that information might have been overlooked. This context allows for faster due diligence and reference checking, including when evaluating static assessments. Responding to High Third-Party Risk Scores What do you do when faced with high risk scores for a third party? Not every data breach justifies terminating business with that partner. Just about every organization contends with cyberattacks and unexpected downtime, and partners are no exception. The more important issue is how they (and you) deal with incidents and take steps to reduce future risks. A change in risk scores may present an opportunity to talk with your business partners about their approach to security. On your end, it’s important to look more closely at whether the risk rules that were triggered will impact your organization’s network. For example, a partner’s risk score might increase because typosquatting websites closely resembling legitimate websites operated by the partner were discovered. Putting those sites on the deny list in your own network is one way to thwart phishing campaigns while you investigate what steps that partner plans to take to protect its brand identity. For smart security decisions that involve your third parties, you need up-to-the-minute context and evidence provided by third-party intelligence.

This is further compounded with the rapid growth in remote work and digital interactions across multiple channels, as it introduces new challenges for security and IT teams responsible for securing their employees’ and customers’ identities. In short, verifying user identities and controlling access to sensitive data is critical, but difficult to achieve. A recent Forrester report, Best Practices: Identity Management and Governance , outlines these challenges, along with many others, that security and identity management teams are facing today. The report found that many organizations are overprovisioning their employees’ access to systems, with research finding that breached employees had 86% more access than required. And, according to Forrester, “despite attempts to address identity sprawl, many organizations struggle to maintain a consistent, rules-based approach to centrally orchestrate the vast array of user accounts and digital access points under their stewardship,” leaving these organizations vulnerable to identity fraud and exposed to financial, legal, and reputational consequences. It’s clear that organizations today require an automated, high-confidence method of managing access and ensuring the authenticity of all users on their network, but this is easier said than done as teams struggle to proactively mitigate the risks that dynamic users and access points create. With this in mind, Forrester outlined 10 key functional areas within identity management that organizations must prioritize, providing best practices within those specific areas. With an intelligence-driven approach to these functional areas, organizations can rest assured that they have a real-time, high-fidelity view of their identity security posture. Automate Password Resets Forrester reports that, “A North American healthcare organization spends $160 to $170 per employee per year on password-related issues… Automation can reduce these costs.” By automatically collecting information on compromised credentials from a vast range of open source, dark web, and technical sources, the Recorded Future Identity Intelligence module offers real-time, machine-readable intelligence that can be directly integrated with existing identity management workflows within any tool, including SOAR solutions like Swimlane . This approach enables organizations to scale their identity management processes, saving time and money for the business, while offering an unmatched source of truth for identity authenticity. Tune Identity Analytics To Avoid False Positives Forrester also recommends that security and identity teams “leverage analytics tools to deliver intelligence across a range of identity use cases.” Additionally, Forrester insisted that these intelligence solutions will only benefit teams if they are able to “parse the signal from the noise” and “ingest, normalize, interpret, and present the data for accurate, actionable results.” Recorded Future’s Identity Intelligence module provides unmatched access to stolen credential information, related to both employee and customer identities, providing organizations with high-confidence, relevant alerts. Organizations can then confidently take action and block access to corporate systems before the compromised identities of employees are exploited, and can ensure customer credentials are secure when accessing any portals or information. This ultimately empowers organizations to be more proactive in preventing identity fraud and dramatically reduces the amount of time it takes to prioritize and respond to real risks to the business. Forrester makes it clear that as the attack surface grows daily, organizations need to advance their security and identity practices and deepen their understanding of their threat landscape. With Identity Intelligence from Recorded Future, organizations are able to quickly detect threats and initiate downstream response workflows, disrupting adversaries before damage is done.

The integration will allow joint clients to leverage Recorded Future Identity Intelligence in Swimlane to accelerate detection of identity compromises and simplify response workflows, in order to maximize existing security investments. The Recorded Future Identity Intelligence module enables security and IT teams to detect identity compromises, for both employees and customers, and respond confidently — without any manual research. Recorded Future automates the collection, analysis, and production of intelligence from a vast range of open source, dark web, and technical sources, and then combines it with world-class research to help drive an accelerated response by security teams. This approach produces real-time intelligence at massive scale, offering an unmatched source of truth for identity authenticity that teams can utilize to prioritize identity threats and initiate downstream response workflows in Swimlane . With the Recorded Future integration for Swimlane , as identity compromises are detected, Swimlane’s low-code automation capabilities make it possible to enrich the exposed accounts, verify if the user is still an employee, if the current password matches the exposed password, and if the exposure was a recycled or novel leak. Depending on the results of this process, Swimlane initiates a specific workflow to remediate the threat and protect the organization: Revoke application access from former employees Employees are leaving the workforce or changing jobs at a record pace. Securely offboarding employees requires IT and security teams to follow procedures to ensure that the departing employees access to corporate systems is revoked. This process is often manual, and therefore error prone. The Recorded Future integration for Swimlane audits active corporate credentials and automatically revokes access in the event that a former employee still has active logins. This results in the remediation of vulnerabilities and time saved for analysts. Mitigate ransomware with company-wide secure passwords Recycling and reusing passwords is a security taboo, but employees inevitably do it anyway. This leaves corporate systems more vulnerable to external threats. With the Recorded Future integration for Swimlane, Swimlane notifies security teams when Recorded Future detects the use of recycled or commonly used passwords, so security teams can proactively ensure that every access point to internal systems are appropriately secured. Since all of this can be done with full automation on a recurring schedule, monitoring and responding to identity exposures no longer has to be a complex and time-consuming process. By eliminating the need to manually aggregate, correlate, and triage information, the Recorded Future Identity Intelligence module integrated into Swimlane empowers analysts to dramatically reduce the amount of time it takes to detect, investigate, and respond to identity fraud and real risks to their business.

And 85% of cybercriminals accessed critical systems and data using stolen credentials . These numbers are a frightening wake-up call that all organizations are targets –regardless of size, market, or industry– and that bad actors are constantly looking for new ways to exploit and breach your company. Particularly over the past couple of years, the rise of new technologies and new ways of working has significantly expanded the playing field for cybercriminals. Here’s why: Security practices are outdated : While most business now takes place outside the four walls of the office via cloud, SaaS, mobile and IoT, many organizations are still focused on securing the perimeter – an approach that can’t scale to support today’s highly distributed workforce and the cloud-based applications they need to access to be productive. Ecosystems are more dynamic and complex: Every person within your ecosystem – employees, partners and customers – is a target for cybercriminals looking to steal credentials and gain access to critical systems or information. Those players within your ecosystem likely don’t always follow password and security best practices. But, it is your responsibility to monitor and verify their identity authenticity at all times. Security, Operations and IT Teams are overwhelmed : The rapid shift to a mostly remote workforce created a spike in required credentials, with more people needing access to critical business systems, platforms and channels via multiple devices. Today’s security and IT teams are overwhelmed and, admittedly, far less optimistic about their abilities to secure employee identities. Take control with proactive, intelligence-led identity fraud detection Identity protection plays a critical role within an overall security strategy, which is why 80% of organizations have increased their focus on identity security over the past year. While you can’t stop cybercriminals from attempting an attack, you can outsmart, outmaneuver and stop them with the right solutions, processes and policies in place. With an intelligence-driven approach to identity fraud prevention, you can proactively defend your organization against identity compromises in real time and take action before damage to the business is done. What do we mean by intelligence-driven? Like most companies you are likely flooded with data 24×7, but what are you able to do with all that information? The key is having quick access to useful and actionable data that you can trust. That’s where intelligence comes in. Intelligence is the key to unlocking the potential of security programs and protecting our organizations. The right intelligence, in the hands of the right people, at the right time, stops attackers in their tracks. Here’s how it works: Account takeover prevention : Quickly detect compromises and initiate downstream response workflows before an account takeover occurs Employee identity monitoring : Automate monitoring in real time across the broadest set of sources, including the dark web for mentions of employee credentials Third-party identity monitoring : Automate monitoring and verification of customer and supply chain partner identities to detect and block identity fraud activities Recorded Future provides real-time intelligence at massive scale Cases of identity theft more than doubled in 2020, according to the Federal Trade Commission. And malware, which is often used for identity theft, increased 358% in 2020 . Now is the time to act by implementing an identity fraud protection strategy designed to scale with the pace and complexity of our digital world. With Identity Intelligence from Recorded Future , your security and IT teams are no longer bogged down by manual research. Recorded Future automates the collection, analysis, and production of intelligence from a vast range of open source, dark web, and technical sources, and then combines it with world-class research to help drive an accelerated response by your security team.

This localized criminal marketplace features a variety of illegal goods and services for sale, many of which pose a threat to local and global enterprises. Insikt Group judges that with moderate confidence that WeTheNorth market was likely created to replace the now debunked The Canadian Headquarters, which shut down in July 2021.  Insikt Group’s Criminal Underground Team first discovered WeTheNorth in July 2021 in advertisements posted on open source forums such as Reddit. The new market appears similar in appearance to the now-debunked Empire market, Alpha Bay, and Torrez. What makes WeTheNorth unique is the lengths the administrators have gone to create a marketplace that is ostensibly geared toward protecting Canadian buyers and sellers and fostering a relatively safe place to complete transactions. Their mission statement is “to provide a safe environment so that Canadians are able to purchase safely, scam-free and away from the street violence, drugs and other items that are more potent, cleaner and safer to use.” The rules of the marketplace are geared towards reigning in what types of services can be sold, as well as being explicit about what is not allowed: sharing of third-party contact information, sales of weapons, and anything related to terrorism. Additional safeguards include mandatory two-factor authentication (2FA) for all vendors, when signing up users are given a unique token to protect their account, vendor fees are non-refundable to prevent scamming, and there are rules in place to prevent padding accounts with fake reviews. Like many darknet markets that operate in service of customers,  WeTheNorth offers 24/7 customer service in both English and French, and it’s open to anyone who uses the site. Vendors or buyers having trouble with the site can reach out and ask for assistance at any time, report technical issues, vendor problems, and scams. The types of transactions that occur on WeTheNorth are largely illegal and undermine any appearance of legitimacy. The most popular sales are drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, and party drugs, but WeTheNorth marketplace also allows the sale of digital products such as stolen credit cards, login credentials, accesses, software and hardware exploits, fraud tutorials, and more. Insikt Group researchers discovered issues with the policing and categorization of listings on WeTheNorth market. Many items are cross-posted and do not align with the category they are listed under. The administrator of the site, whose contact information is also associated with other darknet markets,  has not cracked down on cross-category posting and multiple listings, which could be an indicator that their attention is still focused elsewhere,  leaving WeTheNorth open to low-level drug sellers that wish to bypass market rules. WeTheNorth is a new Canadian dark web marketplace that appears to be hosting a semi-safe space for locals to sell illegal goods and services. There are strict rules in place and they have banned certain categories to help the site be more legitimate and not attract a certain clientele. Dark web markets like WeTheNorth serve as valuable sources of cyber threat intelligence for both private and public sector alike. Insikt Group has observed an increase in localized dark web markets and predicts with moderate confidence that criminal underground websites such as WeTheNorth will continue to increase as international criminals look to localize operations and avoid international law enforcement. As law enforcement cracks down on dark markets and threat actors move quickly to stand up replacement websites, it is imperative for information security teams to monitor these sources for fraud, theft, and targeting of employees, and be able to stop fraudsters and cybercriminals before they use these tools to move through the attack chain.  Recorded Future clients can access more information about WeTheNorth market and other darknet activity through Intelligence Cards in the Recorded Future platform."}}
