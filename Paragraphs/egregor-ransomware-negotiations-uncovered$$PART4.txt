What is \u2018Egregor\u2019?
The Egregor ransomware was first reported publicly in mid-2020, making it a relatively new entry into the criminal economy.
Egregor operators work through an affiliate model, meaning a small group of actors run and maintain the Egregor code base and other actors purchase access to Egregor and use the malware on systems they infect.
This model is best known as Ransomware as A Service (RaaS).
Many security analysts speculated that Egregor was the follow-up to the Maze ransomware, pointing to significant technical overlap between the two ransomware families after Maze\u2019s threat actors declared retirement in November 2020.
