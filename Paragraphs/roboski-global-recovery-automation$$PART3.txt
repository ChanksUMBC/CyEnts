X-Force found infrastructure overlaps with the delivery of RoboSki\u2019s distribution and recent or ongoing activity spreading malware such as AsyncRAT, LokiBot, NanoCore and the Gamarue Botnet, in addition to Agent Tesla , FormBook, njRAT , NanoCore and Remcos RAT , which have previously been reported on IBM\u2019s premium threat intelligence platform TruSTAR and Security Intelligence .
