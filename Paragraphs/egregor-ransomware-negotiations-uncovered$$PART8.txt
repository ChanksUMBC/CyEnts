How each ransom amount was determined was likely a judgment call based on a combination of publicly available information about the victim along with what the operators perceived the victim could afford to pay.
Ultimately, researchers observed that the threat actors appeared to strike a balance between a victim\u2019s ability and willingness to pay while considering multiple additional factors.
In one negotiation, Egregor actors gave the victim organization an initial ransom demand of $1.7 million.
Through some negotiating by the victim, explaining they were a small company, Egregor operators decreased the ransom to $1 million.
In another example, Egregor operators alluded to using an analyst associated with Egregor operations to estimate a victim\u2019s total loss if they were to forego paying the ransom and instead suffer a data leak.
The attacker\u2019s comments indicate that the initial ransom demand is 5-10% of that estimated loss.
