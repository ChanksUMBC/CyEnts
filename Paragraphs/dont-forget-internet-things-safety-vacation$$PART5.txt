Laurie gave an example.
Let\u2019s say your children play video games while on vacation.
They may use a headset, which plugs into the game console, to chat with other players.
The console connects to the router, which creates a firewall rule that allows players to connect to a shared port.
Then, whenever someone connects to that port on the internet service provider\u2019s external address, that person can also connect to your children\u2019s game console.
Removing access, as Laurie points out, is tough.
You would need a UPnP daemon, which the average consumer most likely does not have.
\u201cWhen you leave the house, you can always connect to that port,\u201d says Laurie.
\u201cIf an attacker were to connect to that port, she would be routed to an address assigned to the game console.\u201d
Worse yet, imagine if the next visitor connected his work laptop to that same network.
The visitor could run a business process on that same open port.
