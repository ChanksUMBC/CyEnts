Often, botnets using widespread code can be used by anyone, but they can see more meaningful activity from specific actors and groups.
Links to Romanian-Speaking Operators What IBM found throughout its research, especially during the infiltration of IRC servers, are clues to an operation being managed by Romanian-speaking bot masters.
For one, X-Force found Perl scripts stating flood.ro as the author, and some instances of ShellBot were hosted on a Romanian news site.
The Perl scripts further linked to Romanian-speakers\u2019 IRC channels on multiple servers.
One of the operators used the Romanian hostname blackcat.ro on IRC.
All threat actors conversing in the channels were fluent in Romanian.
These links to Romania line up with threat intelligence on ShellBot by other security researchers in the past few years.
