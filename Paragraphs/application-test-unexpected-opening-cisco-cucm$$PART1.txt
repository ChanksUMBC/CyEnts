Working as security consultants is highly rewarding.
Companies depend on us to view their environment from the perspective of an attacker and find vulnerabilities that could enable threats to succeed.
One of the most impactful parts of our role is when we\u2019re the first to find a major vulnerability that could lead to a widespread compromise beyond just our client.
That\u2019s what happened this year with the Cisco Unified Communications Manager (CUCM) IM & Presence appliance.
