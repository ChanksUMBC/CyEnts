When a new IoT device is put on the market, these criminals have a new opportunity to expose the device’s weaknesses and access user networks.
As a matter of fact, our McAfee Labs Advanced Threat Research team uncovered a flaw in one of these IoT devices: the Wemo Insight Smart Plug, which is a Wi-Fi–connected electric outlet.
Once our research team figured out how exactly the device was vulnerable , they leveraged the flaw to test out a few types of cyberattacks.
The team soon discovered an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to turn off or overload the switch, which could overheat circuits or turn a home’s power off.
What’s more – this smart plug, like many vulnerable IoT devices, creates a gateway for potential hackers to compromise an entire home Wi-Fi network.
In fact, using the Wemo as a sort of “middleman,” our team leveraged this open hole in the network to power a smart TV on and off, which was just one of the many things that could’ve been possibly done.
And as of April 2019, the potential of a threat born from this vulnerability seems as possible as ever.
