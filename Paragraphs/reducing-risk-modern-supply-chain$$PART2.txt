Traditional methods to manage third-party risk can’t keep up.
Governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) teams, as well as their security counterparts, continue to struggle to accurately assess risk given the continually shifting circumstances surrounding who they do business with.
And for many, maintaining on-going visibility into their vendors’ constantly changing risk profile is a difficult or impossible task.

Intelligence acts as a source of truth on key risk indicators, eliminating the guesswork associated with assessing vendor risk.
It reduces the time you spend on vendor risk assessments by 50%, and greatly enhances the quality of those assessments.
