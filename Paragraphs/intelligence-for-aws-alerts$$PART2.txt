One of our core guiding principles at Recorded Future is that security intelligence is for everyone.
No matter what security role you have or business area you work in within your organization, intelligence makes a big difference.
This is why we introduced Recorded Future Express â€” our browser extension that delivers real-time risk scores and context on indicators of compromise and vulnerabilities at zero cost.
Recorded Future Express works with AWS Guard Duty to dramatically accelerate investigation time.
Intelligence is delivered directly on top of AWS GuardDuty, making it fast and easy to ensure that your AWS environment is protected.
Use Recorded Future Express with AWS GuardDuty to speed up threat detection, investigation, and response to threats.
Keeping your AWS Environments safe with Recorded Future Express When you see a finding in your AWS GuardDuty platform that you are interested in, simply click on it and then activate that Recorded Future Express browser extension.
