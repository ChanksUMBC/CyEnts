Ransomware developers increase the odds of victims paying ransoms by crippling as much of the business operation as possible, demonstrating a jump from ICS Kill Chain Stage 1 to Stage 2 operations.
Threat groups that Dragos tracks such as KAMACITE and ELECTRUM \u2014 with links to Hive0103 or Sandworm, a group multiple organizations have attributed to Russian government actors \u2014 work as an access-effects team and show how a Stage 1 intrusion can quickly become a Stage 2 intrusion.
KAMACITE deploys malware with ICS-specific capabilities.
This includes various modules linked to BLACKENERGY2 malware, infecting asset owners in Europe and North America.
After compromising the IT environment, KAMACITE hands off ICS network access to other activity groups, like ELECTRUM, which was suspected in the 2016 Ukraine power event .
Another example of an access-effects team, which Dragos also tracks, is PARISITE , which enables operations for MAGNALLIUM \u2014 a group with links to Hive0016 or APT33 and has been attributed to Iranian state actors.
PARISITE\u2019s initial access activity is associated with a focus on ICS-related entities and serves as an initial access vector for future disruptive operations associated with MAGNALLIUM.
PARISITE represents the first actions against ICS asset owners and operators to breach victim IT networks and establish persistence.
