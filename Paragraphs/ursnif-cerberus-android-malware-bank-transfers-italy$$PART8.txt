Notice the use of the word \u2018Jambo\u2019 in parts of the code.
It is most likely that Ursnif\u2019s operators wrote a jQuery library to simplify HTML Document Object Model tree traversal and manipulation, using it to orchestrate their injections.
Fraudsters can use the library to define the amounts to transfer from accounts and other parameters of the fraudulent transaction.
Figure 4: Injection code sending Cerberus infection URL to Ursnif-infected victims If the victims submit their phone number on the web injection, the remote server will send back a download URL for them to unknowingly download the Cerberus malware.
This injection also keeps the victims\u2019 device identifiers linked to their bot ID and account credentials.
