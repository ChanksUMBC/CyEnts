Shortening the “Time to No”: Real-Time Context for Splunk For years, security operations teams have relied on SIEM technologies like Splunk to collect, correlate, and analyze security event logs from a variety of sources across their network environments.
SIEM tools were built to help teams quickly detect and respond to threats, while streamlining compliance reporting and post-incident investigation.
Yet as the attack surface grows, the abundance of security alerts puts added stress on already overworked security professionals.
If you’re like most analysts, you’re plagued by alert fatigue and you struggle to pinpoint, triage, and respond to real threats targeting your organization using only information from your internal environment.
You’re dealing with too little time and not enough information while your SIEM continues to generate thousands of security alerts each day, making it difficult to determine which alert represents a critical incident and which may just be a redundancy or a false positive.
Valuable time is wasted getting to “no” for irrelevant alerts, while true positives may be slipping through the cracks.
