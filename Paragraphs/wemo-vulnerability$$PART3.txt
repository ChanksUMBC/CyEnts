Our ATR team even has reason to believe that cybercriminals already have or are currently working on incorporating the unpatched Wemo Insight vulnerability into IoT malware.
IoT malware is enticing for cybercriminals, as these devices are often lacking in their security features.
With companies competing to get their versions of the latest IoT device on the market, important cybersecurity features tend to fall by the wayside.
This leaves cybercriminals with plenty of opportunities to expose device flaws right off the bat, creating more sophisticated cyberattacks that evolve with the latest IoT trends.
Now, our researchers have reported this vulnerability to Belkin, and, almost a year after initial disclosure, are awaiting a follow-up.
However, regardless if you’re a Wemo user or not, it’s still important you take proactive security steps to safeguard all your IoT devices.
Start by following these tips: Keep security top of mind when buying an IoT device .
When you’re thinking of making your next IoT purchase, make sure to do your research first.
