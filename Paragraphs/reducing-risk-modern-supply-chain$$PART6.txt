Intelligence Tailor-Made for Risk Management Teams For a long time, threat intelligence has held a reputation as being complex and inaccessible to those without a background in it.
In fact, ten years ago, the notion of a GRC team actively consuming threat intelligence would have been laughable.
Recorded Futureâ€™s Third-Party Intelligence module is specifically created for the GRC team, providing key risk indicators that help to assess, monitor, and mitigate risk.
Transparent remediation details are provided with all findings, giving GRC teams the leverage they need to work with their third-parties to mitigate risk.
