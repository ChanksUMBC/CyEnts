Home is where the \u2018smart\u2019 is.
A recent study revealed the average American household has 25 connected or Internet of Things (IoT) devices.
The number of consumers who have smart home devices connected to their home internet has grown by 38% since the pandemic began.
The findings don\u2019t surprise Brad Ree, the chief technology officer (CTO) of Internet of Things solutions at the ioXt Alliance .
Nor do they surprise Adam Laurie, IBM Security X-Force Red \u2019s lead hardware hacker.
Ree has more than 80 connected devices in his home.
Laurie recently found five connected or IoT devices that he didn\u2019t know existed inside his home.
