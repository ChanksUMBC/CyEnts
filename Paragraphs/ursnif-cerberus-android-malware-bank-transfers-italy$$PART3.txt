In September 2020, Cerberus\u2019 development team decided to disband, spurring an auction attempt that aimed to sell off the source code to the highest bidder, starting at $100,000 .
The code did not sell but was instead shared with the malware\u2019s customer base, which meant it was publicly leaked.
That intentional release of the source code gave rise to numerous malware campaigns involving Cerberus and likely also led to this combined attack with the Ursnif banking Trojan.
