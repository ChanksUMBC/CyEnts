Many risk assessments today suffer the same fate as Cassandra’s prophecies.
When we rely on vague scoring methods or opaque sourcing, our advice is hard to accept, even if it’s accurate.
Too often, organizations fail to act on intelligence because leaders don’t understand it or don’t know the source.
A security intelligence solution must show the risk rules that are triggered by an alert — and be transparent about its sources (Figure 9-2).
This enables security professionals to see for themselves why something like an alert on a particular IP address might represent a real risk.
The extra detail also eliminates the suspicion that information might have been overlooked.
This context allows for faster due diligence and reference checking, including when evaluating static assessments.
