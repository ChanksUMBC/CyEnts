Keep your firmware up-to-date .
Manufacturers often release software updates to protect against these potential vulnerabilities.
Set your device to auto-update, if you can, so you always have the latest software.
Otherwise, just remember to consistently update your firmware whenever an update is available.
Secure your home’s internet at the source .
These smart home devices must connect to a home Wi-Fi network in order to run.
If they’re vulnerable, they could expose your network as a result.
Since it can be challenging to lock down all the IoT devices in a home, utilize a solution like McAfee Secure Home Platform to provide protection at the router-level.
