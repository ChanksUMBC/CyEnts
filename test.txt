Hello this is a test to see if Casey can get brat to work and to see if he can
write code so that he can transfer the brat output format to the input format
of spacy. Heres some random text to fill some space. 
Welcome again to Innistrad, where all is not what it seems, and you must watch your step at every turn. 
The items at yard sales come with a hidden price, you notice out of the corner of your eye that the paintings and statues move as you pass, and the sun sets earlier each day. 
Everyday items such as books, scarecrows, or even pumpkins may not be as innocent as they first appear.
Hello, everyone! Today I am bringing you my thoughts on the green cards of our third visit to the plane of Innistrad. 
There’s quite a mix of cards to discuss, but thankfully none of them strike me as “must have” staples of the format. 
That hardly means that these cards are bad; in fact, I think the diversity of options we received is a great boon for the format, as we can pick and choose what most interests us rather than feeling obligated or pressured to own “the new hotness.” 
With no further delay, let’s begin our cardboard hunt.
