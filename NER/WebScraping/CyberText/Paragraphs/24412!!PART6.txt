Our researchers could not intercept the file received by the rootkit from its C2 server.
Instead, on one of the infected machines, they found a piece of malware that is likely related to CosmicStrand.
This malware creates a user named “aaaabbbb” in the operating system with a local administrator rights.
For more technical details about CosmicStrand, see our researchers’ post on Securelist .
Should we fear rootkits?
Since 2016, CosmicStrand has been serving cybercriminals well, attracting little or no attention from infosec researchers.
That’s worrying, of course, but it’s not all bad.
First, this is an example of sophisticated, expensive malware used for targeted, not mass, attacks — even if seemingly random people sometimes get hit.
Second, there are security products able to detect such malware.
For example, our security solutions protect our users from rootkits.
