We’ve previously written about the most common families of this kind of Trojans.
Here we’ll tell you about another.
It’s similar to the Jocker Trojan subscriber — that’s why it’s called Harly, the (slightly altered) name of the sidekick of a well-known comic book villain.
The two Trojans probably have common origins.
The lowdown on Harly Trojans Since 2020 more than 190 apps infected with Harly have been found on Google Play.
A conservative estimate of the number of downloads of these apps is 4.8 million, but the actual figure may be even higher.
Examples of apps on Google Play that contain Harly malware
Just like the Jocker Trojans, Trojans in the Harly family imitate legitimate apps.
So how does it work?
The scammers download ordinary apps from Google Play, insert malicious code into them, then upload them to Google Play under a different name.
