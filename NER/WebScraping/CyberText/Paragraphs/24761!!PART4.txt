This time, the YoWhatsApp mod, also known as YoWA, has been infected .
This mod attracts users with expanded privacy options, the ability to transfer files up of to 700 MB, increased speed, and so on.
Apparently YoWhatsApp caught the eye of the malware distributors because it has a significant user base.
Also, the fact that the mod wasn’t allowed on Google Play played into the hands of the criminals.
Therefore, users are accustomed to downloading YoWhatsApp from sources of varying degrees of trustworthiness.
One of the main distribution channels for the infected version of the mod was advertising in SnapTube , an app for downloading video and audio.
SnapTube owners themselves probably didn’t even suspect that one of its advertising campaigns was spreading malware.
Along with the infected YoWhatsApp, users got a dropper that delivered the Triada Trojan to their device.
Unlike last year’s campaign, this time the dropper wasn’t the only thing that came with the Trojan.
