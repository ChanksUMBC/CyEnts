The danger of UEFI malware Since UEFI firmware is embedded in a chip on the motherboard and not written to the hard drive, it is immune to any hard drive manipulations.
Therefore, it is very difficult to get rid of UEFI-based malware: even wiping the drive and reinstalling the operating system will not touch UEFI.
For this same reason, not all security solutions can detect malware hidden in UEFI.
Simply put, once malware has made its way into the firmware, it is there to stay.
