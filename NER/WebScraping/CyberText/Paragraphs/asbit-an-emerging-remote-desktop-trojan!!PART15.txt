Rdp Client Module Downloaded from http://222[.]210.157.249:1024/build?project=rdp.client.core&version=4.0.30319&t=28069859 Uses DoH to determine the IP of its control server (v2.team.rfb.ink:5100)
Core Module The new core module includes functions such as capture screenshots, inject keystrokes and execute commands, but we noticed a much cleaner programming style hinting active development of the malware.
We also noticed it added several functions, particularly handlers, for example, vnc, rfb and p2p functions.
Another interesting function is the use of DNS over HTTP (DoH) to query the ip address of its control servers.
For instance, the domain name of the file server where it hosts the rdp module could be any of the following domains: a.rdlite.com:1024 b.rdlite.com:1024 w.rdlite.com:1024
