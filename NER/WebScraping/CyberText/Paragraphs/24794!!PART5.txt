But the attackers managed to exploit the vulnerability before the changes took effect.
The bug allowed them to bypass the transaction verification on the Solana side and issue 120,000 “wrapped ETH” (worth around $334 million at the time of the attack) without freezing the equivalent collateral in the Ethereum blockchain.
The cybercriminals transferred two-thirds of the total amount to an Ethereum wallet, and used the rest to buy other tokens.
Wormhole publicly appealed to the attackers to return the stolen funds and detail the exploit for a $10 million reward.
