Here, purportedly on behalf of Mr. Huang and Nvidia, the cybercriminals announce a giveaway of 50,000 BTC (worth more than a billion US dollars at the time of writing).
One of the main conditions for taking part is that users themselves must first make a contribution, like buying a lottery ticket.
The scammers promise that the participant will immediately get double their money back, not to mention the prospect of winning the 50,000 BTC.
The address of the cryptowallet to which they should make a transfer is given in the instructions for participants.
And at the very bottom of the page is an online broadcast of the “winnings” paid out by the organizers.
