How the Exploit Works First, in a Microsoft Word file, an HTML file is referenced externally in “ word\\_ rels \\ document.xml.rels ”.
This file is responsible for defining relationships associated with embedded objects in the document.
In this case, the relationship being referred to is an OLE object.
OLE objects are part of Microsoft’s proprietary Object Linking and Embedding technology, which allows external documents, such as an Excel spreadsheet, to be embedded within a Word document.
The external HTML file is a javascript that uses the MSDT URL scheme, “ ms-msdt:/ ” followed by arguments, which include Powershell commands, to be able to execute code.
