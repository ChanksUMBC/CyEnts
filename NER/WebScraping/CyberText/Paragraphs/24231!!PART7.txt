When you receive an e-mail seemingly from a well-known company, start with checking where it really came from.
If the sender’s address includes a meaningless jumble of numbers and letters, random words or an unusual domain, it’s more than likely a scam.
Don’t follow links in e-mails and notifications, even if you think you know the sender; it’s always better to open sites from your bookmarks or a search engine, or to enter URLs manually if you know them by heart.
If you suspect phishing, contact the support team of the company the e-mail supposedly came from, and they’ll tell you for sure whether it’s real or fake.
If necessary, they’ll take action and alert other users.
Install reliable antivirus with antiphishing and online fraud protection, which will warn you in a timely manner about the threat.
