Job offer with a surprise Victim: Ronin Network blockchain platform When: March 23, 2022 Loss: $540 million Ronin Network was specifically created by Sky Mavis for the play-to-earn game Axie Infinity , allowing players to buy the in-game currency Smooth Love Potion (SLP) .
In late March 2022, unknown attackers stole from Ronin a record $540 million worth of cryptocurrency.
They were aided by spyware and the magic of social engineering.
The targeted attack was aimed at Sky Mavis employees, one of whom took the bait (most likely on LinkedIn).
Having passed a “selection process”, one of senior engineers received a “job offer” in the form of a PDF file with spyware inside.
This enabled the thieves to take control of four of the network’s private validator keys.
To gain access to the company’s assets, they needed to compromise at least five of the nine validators.
As just mentioned, the spyware helped them get hold of four keys.
The fifth they got hold of due to an oversight by the company itself, which had authorized Axie DAO ( decentralized autonomous organization ) to sign off on transactions to help Ronin Network mitigate user volume, and then forgot to revoke the permission.
