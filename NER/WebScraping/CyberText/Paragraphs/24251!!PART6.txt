Of most interest here is that the Bluetooth module is reprogrammed before power off; that is, its functionality is fundamentally altered.
But what if it can be reprogrammed to the detriment of the owner?

In fact, the team’s main discovery was that the firmware of the Bluetooth module is not encrypted and not protected by Secure Boot technology.
Secure Boot involves multistage verification of the program code at start-up, so that only firmware authorized by the device manufacturer can be run.
The lack of encryption permits analysis of the firmware and a search for vulnerabilities, which can later be used in attacks.
But the absence of Secure Boot allows an attacker to go further and completely replace the manufacturer’s code with their own, which the Bluetooth module then executes.
For comparison, analysis of the iPhone’s UWB module firmware revealed that it’s protected by Secure Boot, although the firmware isn’t encrypted either.
