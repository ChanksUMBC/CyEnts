Luna — more Rust-based ransomware Our researchers discovered the Luna malware in June.
Also written in Rust, it’s capable of encrypting both Windows and Linux devices, as well as ESXi virtual machine images.
In an ad on the dark web , the cybercriminals claim to cooperate only with Russian-speaking partners.
This means that the targets of interest to the attackers most likely are outside the former Soviet Union.
This is also evidenced by the fact that the ransom note embedded into the code of the ransomware is written in English, albeit with mistakes.
