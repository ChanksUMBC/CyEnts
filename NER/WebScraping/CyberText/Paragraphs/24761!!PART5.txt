An additional feature was added to YoWhatsApp that allow intruders to steal the keys required for WhatsApp to operate.
These keys are enough to hijack an account and use it to do things like distributing malware or extracting money from the victim’s contacts.
As a result, the user not only loses money — since Triada signs them up for paid subscriptions — but also risks compromising their contacts, to whom the criminals may try to write in the user’s name.
