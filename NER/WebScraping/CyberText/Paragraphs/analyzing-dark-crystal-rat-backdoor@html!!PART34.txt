A YouTube demonstration confirmed many of the Dark Crystal RAT capabilities we found in reverse engineering Conclusion In this post we walked through our analysis of the sample that the threat intel team provided to us and all its components.
Through our initial triage, we found that its “dfsds.exe” component is Dark Crystal RAT.
We found that Dark Crystal RAT was a .NET executable, and reverse engineered it.
