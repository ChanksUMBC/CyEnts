Earlier this month, Kaspersky experts published a detailed report on a threat they’ve called OnionPoison.
They discovered malicious code being distributed through YouTube video.
The video advertised using Tor Browser for private browsing.
This browser is a modified version of the Firefox browser — with maximum privacy settings.
But its most important feature is that it can redirect all user data through The Onion Router (hence the name Tor) network.
Data is transmitted in encrypted form through several layers of server (hence the onion in the name), where it’s mixed with data of other users of the network.
