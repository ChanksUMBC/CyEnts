On the next page, the victim is asked to share more sensitive information: bank card details, including the CVV code on the back ?
purportedly to pay for delivery.
The attackers don’t specify an amount, mentioning only that the cost depends on the region, and giving assurances that money won’t be debited until the package arrives.
In actual fact, the genuine DHL requires payment for delivery in advance, when the order is made.
If a customer does indeed miss the courier, another delivery attempt is made for free.
What do the criminals do with your payment data?
It’s unlikely the criminals will start charging the victim’s card immediately ?
so that the latter doesn’t link the debits to the bogus “DHL” e-mail.
They’re more likely to sell the payment data on the dark web, and it will be the buyer there who later siphons the funds instead ?
