However, on top of this functionality, they infect the victim’s device with malicious code.
The attackers then use this code to view videos in the background without the user noticing and earn income from boosting the number of views.
Another source of income for cybercriminals is downloading cookies to the victim’s device.
Generally speaking, cookies are stored on the user’s device when they visit a website and can be used as a kind of digital marker.
In a normal situation, affiliated sites promise to take customers to a legitimate site.
For this, they attract users to their own site, which, again, in a normal situation, is done by means of interesting or useful content.
Then, they store a cookie on the user’s computer, and send them to the target site with a link.
Using this cookie, the site understands where the new customer has come from and pays the partner a fee — sometimes for the redirect itself, sometimes a percentage of any purchase made, and sometimes for a certain action, such as registration.
AddScript operators employ a malicious extension to abuse this scheme.
Instead of sending real website visitors to partners, they download multiple cookies onto the infected devices.
