It also drops a malicious libexpat.dll ( 018656e61c7c5fc8d5983a32507fbcf379dd9e2b5dd7d67b8e44590d46a8c51f ) and a benign XLSP.dll ( cca2ea493c8402ed24c9c93328066ae0ce451059e2f954929f24ab7481119b6c ).
The installer drops the components in the C:\\ directory.
Loader Module The loader module starts with the dropped C:\\2.0.50727 or C:\\4.0.30319.
It executes either of these files using RegAsm.exe , an assembly registration tool that is used to load .NET assembly files.
