What’s more, the malware compromised the victim’s own YouTube channel, posting there the same video with a malicious link.
YouTube-based attacks are partly helped by Google’s prioritization of videos in search results.
Attacks of this kind are another example of how ordinary, seemingly safe resources can be misused.
Even an experienced user can’t always distinguish a real link from a malicious one.
Such “inconveniences” of digital life are the best possible argument for installing a high-quality security solution.
Even if your natural online caution fails you, security software will identify and block the threat in good time.
