Due to the space constraints in mobile browsers, URLs are not fully visible.
And in Safari, the address bar was recently moved to the bottom of the screen, where many users don’t even look.
This plays straight into the hands of the cybercriminals because the URL of their fake site looks nothing like the official one: the word DHL doesn’t even make an appearance.
The website text is also small, which means that any design flaws are less noticeable.
