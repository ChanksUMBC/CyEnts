The day after the theft, KuCoin CEO Johnny Lyu promised during a livestream to reimburse the stolen funds.
Lyu kept his word, and by November 2020 he’d tweeted that 84% of the affected assets had been returned to their owners .

Money out of thin air Victim: Wormhole cross-chain bridge When: February 2, 2022 Loss: $334 million
Next in our Top-5 is a heist that used a vulnerability in Wormhole, the cross-chain bridging protocol .
The cybercriminals were aided by the fact that the platform’s developers had made their program code public.
But first things first… Wormhole is a tool that mediates cryptocurrency transactions.
Specifically, it allows users to move tokens between the Ethereum and Solana networks.
Technically, the exchange works like this: tokens are frozen in one chain, while so-called “wrapped tokens” of the same value are issued in the other.
Wormhole is an open-source project with its own repository on GitHub.
Shortly before the heist, the developers placed code there to fix a vulnerability in the protocol.
