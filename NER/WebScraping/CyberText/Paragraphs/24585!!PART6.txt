What’s more, this vulnerability is only relevant for the Windows 11 on ARM64-based systems, which makes exploitation even less practical.
Other vulnerabilities There are surprisingly few non-dangerous vulnerabilities in the September Patch Tuesday update — only one has a low severity rating and another has a medium rating.
The remaining 57, although not as dangerous as the five aforementioned critical ones, still belong to the “important” category.
Therefore, as we already recommended at the beginning of this post, it’s better to update without delay.
How to stay safe First of all, you should fix the already patched vulnerabilities .
In addition, we recommend protecting all computers and servers connected to the internet with security solutions equipped with technologies for vulnerability detection and exploit prevention.
This will help defend your company against both known and yet unknown vulnerabilities.
