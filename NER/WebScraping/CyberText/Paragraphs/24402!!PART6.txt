There were nine such validators in Ronin Networks at the time of the attack, and to carry out the transfer, at least five of them had to approve it.
Eventually, the attackers managed to compromise four validators at the company itself and a fifth in the decentralized autonomous organization Axie DAO , where it would (and should) not have been, were it not for an oversight on the part of Sky Mavis itself.
Turns out in November 2021, due to the high volume of transactions and load on the validators, the company allowed Axie DAO to approve transfers.
After a month, the load decreased, and Axie DAO’s assistance was no longer required — but the rights to approve transactions were not withdrawn, which played into cybercriminals’ hands.
Having penetrated the Sky Mavis system, the hackers also gained access to Axie DAO, which provided the fifth validator needed to withdraw funds from others’ accounts to their own.
The Sky Mavis response On discovering the attack, Sky Mavis acted responsibly and took steps to beef up security.
The company brought in outside security experts from Verichains and CertiK, and conducted a thorough audit of Ronin Networks .
