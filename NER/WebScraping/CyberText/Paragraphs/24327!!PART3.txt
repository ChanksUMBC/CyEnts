The platform provides all kinds of services, including chatting, watching movies, blogging, and gaming — the latter service being the relevant one in this case.
It’s developed by Chinese tech giant Tencent.
Due to the regional specific, it’s difficult to tell how exactly the attack began or how many accounts were stolen.
However, the incident was large enough for Tencent to publicly apologize in a post on Sina Weibo — the Chinese version of Twitter.
The mechanics of the attack are more or less clear.
As mentioned above, attackers spread malicious QR codes offering free game logins.
After scanning such QR codes, users were asked to authenticate with their QQ account.
Once they did, the attackers stole the victims’ credentials to then use them for their own gain.
As a result, an unknown number of people were locked out of their QQ accounts.
Tencent is aware of the issue and has since restored the affected accounts.
