What malware comes with NullMixer NullMixer runs many instances of malware all at once, and more than half of them are malicious downloaders .
That is, once launched, they plant some other thing (or more likely, things) on your system.
As a result, instead of the program you want, you get a whole host of malware.
What else comes in the package besides downloaders?
A whole set of stealers — programs that hunt for login credentials.
The most infamous of these is RedLine , which first showed up on researchers’ radars in 2020 and has since become a “market leader.”
