It’s all about love The ILOVEYOU worm was an evolution of the ideas used in Melissa.
It did not exploit any vulnerability in Microsoft products, but instead used standard functionality.
The only bug was that no warning was displayed when the script was launched from the Outlook e-mail client.
The worm’s functionality was not limited to sending love messages to all recipients.
In addition to e-mail spam sent on behalf of the victim, it was also capable of spreading via the then-popular IRC messenger .
What’s more, the worm downloaded a Trojan program that sent the passwords for mail and internet access to the malware’s creator.
