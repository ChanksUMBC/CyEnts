Although the security of popular programs and operating systems has improved enormously over the past 22 years, malware creators keep finding new loopholes for successful cyberattacks.
Malicious macros have not gone anywhere either.
In February 2022, Microsoft promised to finally restrict the ability to distribute them by banning the execution of any scripts in Office documents obtained over the internet.
In early July 2022, this ban was lifted — it’s reasonable to assume that the fears that something gets broken at the users’ end came true.
Later that same July, Microsoft once again decided to start blocking macros by default , this time explaining to those in need how to get around the ban.
