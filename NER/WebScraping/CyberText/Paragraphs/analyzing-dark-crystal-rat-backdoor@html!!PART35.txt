We extracted the malwareâ€™s configuration, and through dynamic analysis discovered the syntax of its C2 communications.
We implemented a small proof-of-concept server to test the correct format of commands that can be sent to the malware, and how to interpret its uploaded screenshots.
Finally, we took a second look at how actual threat actors would download and use Dark Crystal RAT.
To conclude, indicators of compromise for this version of Dark Crystal RAT (MD5: 047af34af65efd5c6ee38eb7ad100a01) are given in Table 4.
