Even if you don’t have to use Tor Browser to protect your privacy (in most cases, a regular VPN app will suffice), the OnionPoison study offers two useful lessons in safeguarding against malicious activity.
First, only download software from official sites.
For those who want additional verification, many software developers publish so-called checksums.
This is a kind of ID of the “real” program installer.
You can calculate the checksum for the distribution you downloaded to make sure it matches the original.
In the case of OnionPoison, users had to download Tor Browser from unofficial sources anyway as the official site was blocked.
In such situations, checksum verification is very useful.
But, as we mentioned above, the distribution had another red flag: its lack of a legitimate digital signature.
If Windows displays such a warning, better to double-check everything before running the program.
Or just don’t run it at all.
