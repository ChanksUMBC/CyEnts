Here’s how it works.
The FB Stealer extension gets onto users’ devices together with the NullMixer Trojan, which the victims usually pick up when trying to download a hacked software installer.
Once installed, the Trojan modifies the file used to store the Chrome browser settings, including information about extensions.
Then, after activation, FB Stealer pretends to be the Google Translate extension, so that users let their guard down.
The extension does look very convincing, the only downside for the attackers being the browser warning that the official store contains no information about it.
