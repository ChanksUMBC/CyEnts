We recently uncovered a new scheme in which YouTube users are lured to a fake cryptoexchange through videos about a “bug” that supposedly lets them take advantage of a huge discrepancy in exchange rates.
The cryptocurrency exchange rate bug Just like traditional currencies, cryptocurrencies’ exchange rates are determined by the market: as of the writing of this post, one bitcoin is worth around 18 Ethereum on average.
But exchange rates may vary between the different platforms where these currencies are traded.
The differences are usually small, but what if one of the platforms has a technical glitch that works to buyers’ advantage?
Then it could be those buyers’ lucky day, and they might strike it rich thanks to the discrepancy in exchange rates.
Finding a bug like this is a dream for freebie lovers ?
and this is exactly what the scammers are promising in videos on YouTube.
