There are fewer large-scale outbreaks where a piece of malware spreads to tens or hundreds of millions of computers, but we still can’t completely prevent them.
What has definitely changed is the way cyberattacks are monetized, taking company and user data hostage and demanding ransom .
Let’s finish our story with a brief summary of the fate of the ILOVEYOU internet worm’s creator.
Onel de Guzman was a 24-year-old student at the time of the outbreak.
In 2000, FBI officials were able to determine that the original messages containing the worm had been sent to popular mailing lists for users from the Philippines, where de Guzman still lives.
In 2000, he was put on the list of ILOVEYOU’s suspected authors.
But he was not punished for two reasons: a lack of evidence and the absence of a criminal article for cybercrime in local law at the time.
In 2020, de Guzman was tracked down by journalists.
He told them that ILOVEYOU did not originally have a mass mailing function for the Outlook address book, and that he created the worm to steal passwords for internet access because he couldn’t afford to pay for it.
De Guzman never managed to monetize his malicious talents.
At the time the article was published, he was working in a modest phone repair shop in Manila.
