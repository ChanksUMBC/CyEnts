When: February 2014 Loss: $480 million The history of Mt.Gox begins way back in 2007, when it was a platform for exchanging cards from the Magic: The Gathering game.
Three years later, amid the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies, the site owner, US programmer Jed McCaleb, decided to turn it into a cryptoexchange, but then sold the service to French developer Mark Karpelès in 2011.
Just two years later, Mt.Gox was trading around 70% of the world’s bitcoin.
The rapid rise was followed by a crippling crash.
On February 7, 2014, the exchange suddenly blocked all bitcoin withdrawals.
The company blamed the move on technical issues.
Outraged customers gathered outside the headquarters of Mt.Gox in Tokyo, demanding their money back.
