This method ensures privacy: websites see only the address of the last server in the Tor network — the so-called exit node — and cannot see the user’s real IP address.
But that’s not all.
The Tor network can also be used to bypass restricted access to certain sites.
For example, in China, many “Western” internet resources are blocked, so users turn to solutions such as Tor to access them.
Incidentally, YouTube is also officially unavailable in China, so, by definition, the video is aimed at those looking for ways to get round the restrictions.
It’s likely that this was by no means the only method of distributing the OnionPoison malware, and that other links were placed on resources inside China.
Normally, a user can download Tor Browser from the project’s official website.
However, this site is also blocked in China, so there’s nothing unusual about people seeking alternative download sources.
