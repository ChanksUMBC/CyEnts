A device with a miner slows down, heats up, and becomes unusable long before it would normally.
What’s more, a miner consumes lots of electricity — which the affected user of course has to pay for.
This post lays out our experts’ main findings, and gives tips on how to protect your devices from miners.

Malicious mining on the rise Having skyrocketed last year, cryptocurrency prices this year have collapsed just as dramatically.
One would expect a corresponding drop in malicious mining, but in fact the exact opposite has occurred: in the first three quarters of 2022, compared to the same period in 2021, the number of new miner modifications increased, as did the number of affected users.
Cybercriminals were especially active in the third quarter, during which our solutions detected more than 150,000 new variants of malicious miners.
For comparison, in the same period in 2021, fewer than 50,000 appeared.
Our researchers also studied what kinds of malware attackers tried to plant on victims’ devices after exploiting known software vulnerabilities .
In the first three quarters of 2022, about one in seven cases turned out to be a malicious miner.
And throughout the year, as cryptocurrency prices steadily fell, the share of miners among infections showed stable growth.
