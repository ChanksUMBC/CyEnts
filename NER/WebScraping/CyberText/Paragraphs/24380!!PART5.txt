Curiously, if you enter the address of the scammers’ cryptowallet on blockchain.com , it turns out that some money has actually been transferred thereto — a total of 0.42 BTC (worth more than $8000 at the time of writing).
It’s unknown who sent the funds: it could be victims or the scammers themselves, for example, to check if the wallet is working or to pretend to be “lottery” participants.
In any case, there’s no trace of the reported 50,000 BTC, and no hint of double-your-money paybacks.
