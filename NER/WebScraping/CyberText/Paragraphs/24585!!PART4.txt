CVE-2022-34700 and CVE-2022-35805 — a pair of vulnerabilities in the Microsoft Dynamics customer relationship management (CRM) software.
Their exploitation allows an authenticated user to execute arbitrary SQL commands, after which the attacker can elevate their rights and execute commands inside the Dynamics 365 database with db_owner rights.
Since an attacker still needs to somehow authenticate, the CVSS ratings of these vulnerabilities are slightly lower (8.8), but they are still considered critical.
A vulnerability relevant to ARM processors — CVE-2022-23960 CVE-2022-23960 is the second vulnerability that was publicly disclosed before the patch.
