The goal of the attackers is to overload the targeted service to such an extent that it slows down and eventually fails.
Meanwhile, it’s ordinary users whose routers are hijacked that suffer slower internet speeds because their routers are busy sending malicious requests, and only handle other traffic when they pause for breath.
According to our data, routers in 2021 were most actively attacked by two malware families: Mirai and Mēris, with the former leading by a huge margin — accounting for almost half of all attacks on routers.
Mirai
This notorious malware family with the sweet-sounding name (meaning “future” in Japanese) has been known since 2016.
Besides routers, it’s known to infect IP cameras, smart TVs, and other IoT devices, including corporate ones, such as wireless controllers and digital advertising displays.
Initially conceived to carry out large-scale DDoS attacks on Minecraft servers, the Mirai botnet was later unleashed on other services.
