How to protect yourself from malware on Android The best way to fight malware is to avoid situations where you might get it in the first place.
In this case, there are three simple rules to follow to protect yourself: Don’t download apps from unknown sources.
In fact, it’s a good idea to block the ability to install apps from places other than Google Play on your Android smartphone.
Don’t install alternative clients for messaging apps.
Even if official versions of apps aren’t always ideal, they’re much more reliable and secure.
Use good protection and always keep it enabled.
Kaspersky for Android can detect different modifications of the Triada Trojan and other Android malware and block them before they have a chance to wreak havoc.
Keep in mind that with the free version of our mobile protection you need to manually run the scan every time you download or install something new.
The full version automatically scans every new app.
