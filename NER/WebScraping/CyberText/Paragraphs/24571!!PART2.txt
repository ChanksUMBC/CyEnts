A browser extension is a plug-in that adds functionality to your browser.
For example, they can block ads on web pages, make notes, check spelling and much more.
For popular browsers there are official extension stores that help select, compare and install the plug-ins you want.
But extensions can also be installed from unofficial sources.
It’s important to note that, for an extension to do its job, it will need permission to read and change the content of web pages you view in the browser.
Without this access, it will likely be completely useless.
In the case of Google Chrome, extensions will require the ability to read and change all your data on all websites you visit.
Looks like a big deal, right?
However, even official stores draw little attention to it.
For example, in the official Chrome Web Store, the Privacy practices section of the popular Google Translate extension states that it collects information about location, user activity and website content.
But the fact that it needs access to all data from all websites in order to work, isn’t revealed to the user until they’re installing the extension.
