There’s another key security rule: don’t use unofficial clients for messaging apps.
To understand why this is important, let’s take a few steps back and look a little more closely at how messaging apps work.
Most of them operate according to the client-server model , where the user interacts directly with the client app.
Data exchange between client and server occurs through a special protocol .
For many messaging apps this protocol is open.
This makes it possible to create unofficial modified clients with additional features, such as viewing messages other users have deleted, creating mass mailings, customizing the interface, and so on.
So where’s the danger?
With official clients, you’re entrusting your correspondence only to the creator of the messaging app.
When you use an unofficial client, you’re entrusting it not only to the developers of the messaging system but also to the developers of the unofficial client app.
On top of that, the modified client may be distributed through unofficial sources (which, as we recall, shouldn’t be trusted).
