Another WhatsApp modification, known as YoWhatsApp, has turned out to be malicious: it downloads the Triada Trojan to smartphones, which shows ads, secretly subscribes the user to paid content, and steals WhatsApp accounts.
How did this happen and what lessons can we learn?
Don’t feed crocodiles with your hand, or Simple Cybersecurity Rules Probably the most important rule of information security is to reduce your risks.
To do this: Don’t visit suspicious websites — they may contain malicious ads or be a front for a phishing scam.
Don’t download hacked versions of programs via torrents.
If you do, there’s a good chance that cracks will contain a password-stealing Trojan , for example.
Don’t click on links in e-mails that were sent from unknown addresses, and don’t open attachments — there could be all kinds of malware lurking there.
You get the idea: being careful goes a long way toward protecting yourself against cyberthreats.
At the same time, it’s still important to keep your antivirus enabled and updated — as insurance in case something happens.
Don’t tempt fate by doing the online equivalent of walking down a deserted alley late at night.
If you apply a little bit of common sense, you can greatly reduce your chances of falling prey to scammers.
In addition to the above-listed ways to lower the risk of something bad happening, it’s worth adding one more: don’t download mobile apps from unofficial sources.
Google and Apple verify apps before adding them to their stores, so the chances of encountering malware there are slim — albeit still not zero (especially in the case of Google Play ).
Huawei does the same with its Huawei AppGallery store, although malware has already been found there too.
But it’s much more likely that you’ll run into malware on open platforms that let you simply download an APK file .
