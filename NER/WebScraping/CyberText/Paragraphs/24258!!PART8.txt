If the user unwittingly left the factory settings unchanged, attackers can easily guess the password — especially if they know the router brand — and infect the router.
Recently however, manufacturers have started taking security more seriously by assigning a unique random password to each particular device, making this method less effective.
But guessing the right combination for older models is still child’s play.
Vulnerability exploitation Router vulnerabilities are holes in your gateway to the internet through which all kinds of threats can stroll right into your home or corporate network — or maybe just sit in the router itself, where detection is less likely.
The above-mentioned Mēris botnet does just that, exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities in MikroTik routers.
According to our research , several hundred new vulnerabilities have been discovered in routers in the past two years alone.
To secure weak spots, router vendors release patches and new firmware versions (essentially routers’ operating system updates).
Unfortunately, many users simply do not realize that the router software needs to be updated, just like other programs.
