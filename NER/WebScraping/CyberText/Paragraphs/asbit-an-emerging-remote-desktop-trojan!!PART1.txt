Introduction Juniper Threat Labs is currently monitoring an emerging Chinese Remote Desktop Trojan called Asbit.
It’s a remote access Trojan being advertised on its developer’s website as a “Fast Remote Desktop”.
This RAT first made its appearance in 2021 and kept updating its infrastructure and features as it went along.
It uses a number of strategies to avoid endpoint and network detection.
By using DNS over HTTPS (DoH) to resolve the IP addresses of its control servers, it aims to get past network DNS filters.
The domain asbit[.]cn was registered on January 31, 2021.
This domain was used to host the malware and its modules.
It also hosts the threat actor’s website.
The website is still live at the time of this publication.
