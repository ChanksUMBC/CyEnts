Our experts analyzed two more malware families that recently appeared on the dark web with similar functionality: Black Basta and Luna .
Black Basta — ransomware for ESXi Black Basta was first discovered in February.
It exists in two versions: for Windows and for Linux, with the latter primarily targeting ESXi virtual machine images.
A standout feature of the Windows version is that it boots the system in safe mode before encrypting.
This allows the malware to evade detection by security solutions, many of which don’t work in safe mode.
At the time of posting, Black Basta operators had released information on 40 victims, among them manufacturing and electronics firms, contractors, and others.
According to Kaspersky, their targets are located in the U.S., Australia, Europe, Asia, and Latin America.
