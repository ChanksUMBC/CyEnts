Of course, that’s not enough for a serious, practical attack.
For that, an attacker needs to analyze the firmware, try to replace it with something of their own making, and look for ways to break in.
The authors of the paper describe in detail the theoretical model of the attack, but don’t show practically that the iPhone is hackable through Bluetooth, NFC or UWB.
What’s clear from their findings is that if these modules are always on, the vulnerabilities likewise will always work.
Apple was unimpressed by the study, and declined to respond.
This in itself, however, says little: the company is careful to keep a poker face even in cases when a threat is serious and demonstrated to be so in practice.
Bear in mind that Apple goes to great lengths to keep its secrets under wraps: researchers have to deal with closed software code, often encrypted, on Apple’s own hardware, with made-to-order third-party modules.
A smartphone is a large, complex system that’s hard to figure out, especially if the manufacturer hinders rather than helps.
No one would describe the team’s findings as breathtaking, but they are the result of lots of painstaking work.
