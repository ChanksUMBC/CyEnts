Victims and possible infection vectors of CosmicStrand Oddly enough, the CosmicStrand victims identified by our researchers were ordinary people using our free antivirus.
They seemingly had nothing to do with any organization of interest to attackers of this caliber.
It also turned out that the motherboards infected in all known cases came from just two manufacturers.
Therefore, it is likely that the attackers found some common vulnerability in these motherboards that made UEFI infection possible.
It is unknown how exactly the cybercriminals managed to deliver the malware.
The fact that these CosmicStrand victims were small fries may indicate that the attackers behind this rootkit can infect UEFI remotely.
But there are other possible explanations: for example, experts at Qihoo 360, having investigated early versions of CosmicStrand of 2016 vintage, suggested that one of the victims had purchased a modified motherboard from a reseller.
