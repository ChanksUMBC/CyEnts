This improvement is available in all Apple smartphones since the iPhone 11.
If, for example, you lose your phone somewhere and its battery runs out after a while, it doesn’t turn off completely, but switches to Low Power Mode, in which only a very limited set of modules are kept alive.
These are primarily the Bluetooth and Ultra WideBand (UWB) wireless modules, as well as NFC.
There’s also the so-called Secure Element — a secure chip that stores your most precious secrets like credit card details for contactless payments or car keys — the latest feature available since 2020 for a limited number of vehicles.
Bluetooth in Low Power Mode is used for data transfer, while UWB — for determining the smartphone’s location.
In Low Power Mode, the smartphone sends out information about itself, which the iPhones of passers-by can pick up.
If the owner of a lost phone logs in to their Apple account online and marks the phone as lost, information from surrounding smartphones is then used to determine the whereabouts of the device.

The announcement quickly prompted a heated discussion among information security experts about the maze of potential security risks.
The research team from Germany decided to test out possible attack scenarios in practice.
When powering off the phone, the user now sees the “iPhone Remains Findable After Power Off” message.
